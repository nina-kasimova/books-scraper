Who are the four greatest Portuguese poets of the 20th century? A. Fernando Pessoa. Trust me, it's funny. But it does take a little explaining.Fernando Pessoa, in order to express various philosophical and poetic moods, constructed a series of what he termed \u201cheteronyms.\u201d The heteronym, although similar to the mask or persona, differs in that each one is equipped with a name, a personality, a biography, and a physical description, as well as a distinct writing style. Although Pessoa made use of more than five dozen heteronyms in the course of his thirty-five years, the best known are Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, and Bernardo Soares. Of these four, his greatest creation--and perhaps the heteronym closest to Pessoa's self--is Bernardo Soares, the \"author\" of The Book of Disquiet. The Book of Disquiet, if not unique, is close to it. It is a little like a novel, often like a collection of prose poems, and often like a series of aphorisms and philosophical reflections. The heteryonum that is Soares enables Pessoa to communicate a disciplined, definite vision of the world, necessarily limited in scope, but intensified and concentrated. In this sense, it resembles Roman and English satire, its authorial mask as carefully crafted and resonant as those of Horace and Juvenal, Pope and Swift. Soares, however, takes no interest in vice, let alone the reform of humankind; in fact, he seems to care little about humanity in general, or people in particular. It is here that the novelistic aspect of this work becomes interesting. Soares is a shy, isolated man, a clerk at a Lisbon commercial firm who adds up columns of figures, and seems to do little else. Although he mourns his colleagues when they pass away, he never seems to communicate with them when they are alive; the closest he seems to get to fellowship are his encounters with the waiter in the little cafe where he eats his nightly dinner and consumes his nightly bottle of wine. At first, we feel sorry for him, for we feel his great isolation and are moved by his great passion and profound love for beauty which he can only express through his journal. Slowly, however, we begin to see that this isolation is a personal and artistic choice, a way of refining his art and his being . If he cares about human beings at all, it is only because they are useful adjuncts to his own magnificent loneliness, because they resonate as discrete elements of the poet's imagination, much as a certain play of light on a Lisbon street may reflect one particular color of the canvas that is the poet's consciousness. Perhaps this is why the book \u201cThe Book of Disquiet\u201d reminds me of most is The Chants of Maldoror, that uncompromising paean to the magnificent isolation of evil.There is of course a great difference. Maldoror could only have been produced by a very young man hiding beneath a very old mask. His persona is a posture of isolation through which he begins to know himself. The Book of Disquiet, on the other hand, is the work of someone who knows himself well, and cares only about reaching a kind of existential purity: a clarity of view, a refinement of mood, the isolation of particular beauties that resonate more deeply and linger longer than the others.Soares is a monk of the poetic mind, for whom aloneness is a vocation. Its fruit, this memorable book, is rare and delicious, filled with vivid descriptions, evocative language, and refined reflections..", "Humans are social beings, to the extent that those who prefer solitude to the company of others are usually perceived as troubled individuals, outside of the norm; it took me a long time to feel comfortable with being alone, with dampening the guilt that flared up in me every time I begged off going out with a group of friends.

It is always a welcome reinforcement when I come across a book penned by a fellow recluse\u2014and The Book of Disquiet could be a solitary soul's bible, so powerfully does it speak in the language of single-place table settings, corner-chair cobwebs and bachelor apartments. It has achieved pride of place on my bedside stack, where I can ladle myself servings of Pessoa's wisdom at leisure.This book's voluntarily alone author is Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese poet, writer, and polylinguist who invented fully-fleshed out heteronyms\u2014distinct and separate personalties of differing nationality and gender\u2014in order to pursue his writing in various idiosyncratic shades and styles. The Book of Disquiet is a collection of the aphoristic prose-poetry musings of one such heteronym, that of Bernardo Soares, assembled from notes, entries, and jottings made over a span of some thirty years and left unpublished at the time of Pessoa's death in 1935. Richard Zenith, the editor and translator of this stunning, haunting, and achingly beautiful paean to the imaginary potentiality of man, has compiled the definitive edition of this tome in a truly outstanding translation that captures the expressive eloquence of Pessoa and his magical, metaphorically rich manner of constructing word images to portray his unique way of life.There is no finer encomium to the shattering melancholy and bracing affirmation of loneliness and solitude than the five hundred plus entries that make up The Book of Disquiet; and few better descriptions of existential nausea, of the desperate efforts to perceive a reason to continue with the painful disappointments, shadow terrors, and numbing meaninglessness of human existence. As Pessoa\u2014writing as Soares\u2014quietly and unassumingly goes about his daily rituals of walking, working as a book-keeper and inhabiting the well-trod spaces of his rented room in the real world, he is living a rich existence within the wildly creative contours of his mind: as a knight errant, a rich merchant, a pirate, a voyager, a lover of countless women, a guide to the cosmos, an inhaler of sunrises and embracer of sunsets, the guiding hand of every drop of Lisbon's morning showers, the leaves shaken by a sudden burst of wind. Having been sentenced to a term of life by an errant universe, Pessoa decided to renounce action and ambitions in what we hold to be real life to pursue a variegated and abundant existence within the realm of dreams. As our life is measured through the archived clippings of one's memory, whether one actually performed the deeds recalled matters less than the detail and substance they contain.Such, at least, is the defense offered by Pessoa; yet often his solipsistic persuasions are contradictory, defensive; and when the mask slips we can see the depth of pain and loneliness underneath the placid surface of his imaginary life. There is much repetition and mulling over of themes from different angles, but the writing is so expressive and raw and honest that, to myself at least, it never becomes tedious\u2014even as the tedium of existence, the stretching of the soul on the rack of time, is one of the principal ideas that populate Pessoa's thoughts and entries. It is as if tedium was experienced as a box of chocolates, each colour and coating, each form and flavour, each taste and texture, mulled over, pondered, drawn out and examined, and then set to paper as a running record to remind of an eccentric daily pleasure.This is a book to be mused upon and savored, one that can be imbibed in different ways: it can be read straight through\u2014the way I approached it, drawn into a white heat of blistered enthrallment\u2014or sparingly sampled over weeks, months, even years. The order the aphorisms are assembled in is purely a construction of Zenith; he stresses such in his introduction and encourages each reader to create their own sequence for the collected entries. However the reader decides to approach The Book of Disquiet, they will be rewarded with the inventive honesty of a hale and wounded man from a work that is truly sui generis. *******************************************************I've recently picked up the Serpent's Tail Extraordinary Classic edition, which features a translation by Margaret Jull Costa, who performed similar duties for Jos\u00e9 Saramago's last half-dozen books. Distinct from Zenith, obviously, but just as potent and powerful\u2014and the differently parsed words and sentences only serve to present Pessoa's incomparable poetry of loneliness in a new light, equally fulgent and searing, just focussed from an alternate angle. A richly marbled interiority of immanent pain and transcendent beauty. *******************************************************Revisiting the disquietude of early modern Lisbon, I'm reminded anew how this collection of Pessoa's dispassionate passion is one whose title is so perfectly matched to the content within that one can sit there (all by oneself, of course) cushioned within the utter silence of an unvoiced existence, serving as an unexciting urban renewal zone for migratory dust motes and unimpressive highland anchored lethality for predatory silken arachnids, with a nigh sardonic set to the tight-lipped, hesitantly-committed smile of satisfaction that imprints itself upon one's otherwise stoney visage, and marvel at how much one man's textually decanted imaginative impressions and gossamer ruminations running the interior gauntlet of unlived memories, unacted performances, unconsummated affairs, unshed tears, unwatched observations, unwinged flights, ungrounded fears, unfelt kisses, untouched caresses, uninvolved emotions, unexercised exertions, untasted repasts, unliked friendships, unmet acquaintances, untold stories, unpoured libations, undone happenings, unannounced recollections, unlit umbrages, unformed expressions, untraveled journeys, unnoticeable leavenings, unhoused guilts, and unarticulated speechifications resonate, to the fullest extent, with the plucked strings ever aquiver within the utterly empty, lonely, and withdrawn chambers of the mind- and/or house-bound soul..", "I just came across this article about literary Lisbon with a lot about Pessoa - very good https://lithub.com/wandering-through-...The Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa If you read this, you need to know what you are signing up for, so, below, I\u2019ll let Pessoa speak for himself.

It\u2019s a series of vignettes, random thoughts and meditations all written between 1913 and 1935. It\u2019s a work of genius, of course. Pessoa, the famous Portuguese writer and poet was known for his multiple writing personalities (heteronyms). Disquiet was supposedly written by Bernardo Soares, an excruciatingly lonely and socially dysfunctional man. He\u2019s a shipping clerk in a textile wholesaler and spends his entire life a few blocks from his tiny apartment with one window on a balcony. He goes to the same restaurant, same tobacconist and same barber for thirty years. All of them die one by one in their 70\u2019s, which he discovers by going into the shop and finding out they died the day before. The first two passages show some of his severe social issues. \u201cMoreover, I am bothered by the idea of being forced into contact with someone. A simple invitation to dine with a friend provokes in me an anguish it would be hard to define. The idea of any social obligation \u2013 going to a funeral, discussing an office matter face-to-face with someone, going to the station to wait for someone I know or don\u2019t know - the mere idea disturbs a whole day\u2019s thoughts. Sometimes I am concerned all through the night and sleep badly. And the real thing, when it happens, is absolutely insignificant, justifying nothing; and the thing repeats itself and I don\u2019t ever learn to learn.\u201d \u201cSometimes saying hello to someone intimidates me. My voice dries up, as if there were a strange audacity in having to say that word out loud.\u201d \u201cThere are metaphors that are more real than the people walking down the street. There are images in the secret corners of books that live more clearly than many men and women. There are literary phrases that possess an absolutely human individuality. There are passages in paragraphs of mine that chill me with fear, so clearly do I feel them to be people, standing alone so freely from the walls of my room, at night, in shadows\u2026\u201d \u201cYes, dreaming that I am, for example, simultaneously, separately, unconfusedly, a man and a woman taking a walk along a riverbank, To see myself, at the same time, with equal clarity, in the same way, with no mixing, being the two things, integrated equally in both, a conscious boat in a southern sea and a printed page in an ancient book. How absurd this seems! But everything is absurd, and this dream is the least of the absurdities.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing that reveals poverty of mind more quickly than not knowing how to be witty except at the expense of others.\u201d \u201cI go forward slowly, dead, and my vision is no longer mine, it\u2019s nothing: it\u2019s only the vision of the human animal who, without wanting, inherited Greek culture, Roman order, Christin morality, and all the other illusions that constitute the civilization in which I feel.\u201d \u201cIn the dark depth of my soul, invisible, unknown forces were locked in a battle in which my being was the battleground, and all of me trembled because of the unknown struggle. A physical nausea at all of life was born when I awakened. A horror at having to live rose up with me from the bed. Everything seemed empty, and I had the cold impression that there is no solution for any problem.\u201d \u201cEnnui is not the illness of the boredom of not having anything to do, but the more serious illness of feeling that it\u2019s not worthwhile doing anything. And being that way, the more there is to do, the more ennui there is to feel.\u201d \u201cHow many times, how many, as now, has it pained me to feel what I am feeling \u2013 to feel something like anguish only because that\u2019s what feeling is, the disquiet of being here, the nostalgia for something else, something unknown, the sunset of all emotions, the yellowing of myself fading into ashy sadness in my external awareness of myself.\u201d \u201cDuring certain very clear moments of meditation, like these in which, at the beginning of the afternoon, I wander observingly through the streets, every person brings me a message, every house shows me something new, every sign has an announcement for me.\u201d \u201cSometimes, with a sad delight, I think that if some day, in a future to which I may not belong, these words I\u2019m writing will endure and receive praise, I will finally have people who \u2018understand\u2019 me, my people, the true family to be born into and to be loved by. But far from being born into it, I will have already died a long time before. I will be understood only in effigy, when affection no longer compensates the dead person for the disaffection he experienced when alive.\u201d \u201cI consider life an inn where I have to stop over until the coach from the abyss arrives. I don\u2019t know where it will take me because I don\u2019t know anything. I could consider this inn a prison because I\u2019m force to stay inside it; I could consider it a place for socializing because I meet others here\u2026I slowly sing, only to myself, songs that I compose as I wait.\u201d \u201cEverything is emptier than the void\u2026.If I think this and look around to see if reality is killing me with thirst, I see inexpressive houses, inexpressive faces, inexpressive gestures. Stone, bodies, ideas \u2013 everything\u2019s dead. All movements are stopping points, all of them the same stopping point. Nothing says anything to me. Nothing is familiar to me, not because I find it strange but because I don\u2019t know what it is. The world is lost. And in the depth of my soul \u2013 the only reality at this moment \u2013 there is an intense, invisible anguish, a sadness, like the sound of someone weeping in a dark room.\u201d Not an easy or a pleasant read, but genius.

Vastly known Portuguese poet, famous for his ability to create different \"personalities\" and stick to them closely to perfection, writing in different styles according to the voice of each character.

Or a man who disguised himself out of boredom and who was able to live more than 70 different and complete lives through all these invented \"characters\" to become a complete real person? Maybe all these options at once. Maybe none. We'll never know.Anyway, even though I knew about Pessoa, I wasn't prepared for this book. Not only unconnected recollections of the \"supposed\" life of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's characters, but also unanswerable questions which left me kind of anxious and peaceful at the same time, if that makes any sense...Questions regarding consciousness, the almost obsession about dreams and the state of peaceful lethargy of sleeping, doubts aroused regarding deities, love and death. And about what it is to be happy or to feel nostalgia about a non existent past, or about egoism and solitude. But all this questions made even more intense with this overflowing passion for writing, and for literature. And for Lisbon. A privileged mind which opens for us, humble readers who want to witness an amazing transformation of the world surrounding us, seeing for the first time what our lives really are, or what they aren't and what we should expect them to be.An experience which will leave you exhausted but with renewed energy to face this extenuating and unavoidable journey which we call life..", "Livro do Desassossego = The Book of Disquiet, Fernando PessoaThe Book of Disquiet is a work by the Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa (1888\u20131935).Fernando Pessoa was many writers in one.

For it has been my faithful companion for over two weeks, as my friends are witness for their company was always there with me. As soon as I turned the last page, I worried, what am I going to do now? But now it seems my only consolation is all the quotes I collected during this lavish period. So I now populate my new solitude with these gems, with Fernando Pessoa\u2019s amazing dreams.'I've never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. My only real concern has been my inner life. My worst sorrows have evaporated when I've opened the window on the street of my dreams and forgotten myself in what I saw there.'I\u2019ve always been a dreamer, but I dream mainly through readings that I always carried along with me in my life\u2019s journey. I cannot now pretend to be a dreamer like Fernando Pessoa, or Bernardo Soare: I\u2019ve never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. For I lived more in the real world than Pessoa confessedly did. Every dream is the same dream, for they're all dreams. Let God change my dreams, but for my gift of dreaming. For him they were his nourishment, his own life. But for me they are my leisure. Yes, my dreams might not be his dreams but they are as alive as his, as dear to me as his were to him.'I read and I am liberated. I acquire objectivity. I cease being myself and so scattered. And what I read, instead of being like a nearly invisible suit that sometimes oppresses me, is the external world\u2019s tremendous and remarkable clarity, the sun that sees everyone, the moon that splotches the still earth with shadows, the wide expanses that end in the sea, the blackly solid trees whose tops greenly wave, the steady peace of ponds of farms, the terraced slopes with their paths overgrown with grape-vines.'We might be distinct souls, but there is one thing that we are one and that I felt is his anxiety and is also my own:'My tedium takes on an air of horror, and my boredom is a fear. My sweat isn\u2019t cold, but my awareness of it is. I\u2019m not physically ill, but my soul\u2019s anxiety is so intense that it passes through my pores and chills my body.'Yes, it seems we could even be related, 'It sometimes occurs to me, with sad delight, that if one day (...) the sentences I write are read and admired, then at last I'll have my own kin, people who 'understand' me, my true family in which to be born and loved.'The main difference is that I am not a writer, I am only a reader. And so I am his soul mate for I complete him when I leaf through the pages of his book. As are all his readers that give life to his writings. His prose so beautiful it is heartbreaking, despite his own insecurities. But I would I wish to be a writer if the price is to not live? Better to write to dare to live...Do you suppose that that is the reason of my contentment? Should you ask if I\u2019m happy, I\u2019ll say that I\u2019m not. For me there is not so much solitude, no lack of friendship, no ceaseless tedium. Only unhappiness is elevating, and only the tedium that comes from unhappiness is heraldic like the descendants of ancient heroes. So, I could not ever be a good poet and I am glad I had never desired so high. Although I have to confess that I had some dreams of being a poet. But these were only dreams\u2026 Perhaps I could have never been a poet, for above all I love. I love my friends, I love my children, I loved a man and I love life. And I could never declare like Pessoa, We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It\u2019s our concept \u2013 our own selves \u2013 that we love. Or even that [l]ife hinders the expression of life. If I actually lived a great love, I would never be able to describe it. Maye I should read other poets\u2026 But I have to agree with him when he states, I wake up to make sure I exist... Aren\u2019t we all always unsure if we truly exist?Am I ordinary?, for most of the time I realize I think with my feelings. While Pessoa confesses: I believe most people think with their feelings, whereas I feel with my thoughts.  Yes, I am happily ordinary. While his happiness is as painful as [his] pain.However, the more I say I don\u2019t agree with our poet, the more I believe him. Am I saying nonsense? Sometimes to be a poet is to unbelieve. Oh, I believe we can travel through our dreams, we can imagine unimaginable places within our dreams:'What can China give me that my soul hasn't already given me? And if my soul can't give it to me, how will China give it to me? For it's with my soul that I'll see China, if I ever see it. I could go and seek riches in the Orient, but not the riches of the soul, because I am my soul's riches, and I am where I am, with or without the Orient.'But after all my incoherence, I can only agree with Pessoa:'It's the central error of the literary imagination: to suppose that others are like us and must feel as we do. Fortunately for humanity, each man is just who he is, it begin given only to the genius to be others as well.'.But our natures are diverse, for I am not as solitary as he was. I am solitary, you might say, but I have my books. What does he have? Only his dreams or a poignant and fruitful solitude. To understand, I destroyed myself. To understand is to forget about loving. Can we be that alone? I ask myself, or only genius and poets have that gift? Perhaps, if so that is a sad truth.Some closing remarks\u2026I feel I need to add a few considerations, besides my ramblings above.Pessoa called this work as a factless biography. It might present distinct tones of the absurd, and despite its hints of indifference or even cynicism, it\u2019s nevertheless a quintessential trait of its writer. He reveals an ethereal existence, or his own life, through his willful approach towards his own disquietude; through his sense of a consciousness that suffers with a tedium that results basically from his own senselessness existence. And in that he could not be more truthful.Faced with the life\u2019s adversity, and aiming to overcome the anguish to him so acute, he imagines, he dreams. This may be one of the reasons for his so many personalities (his heteronyms, who could each write in distinct literary styles) to be born. He is not one, he is many. So he can experience different lives in only one existence. According to him:'My intellect has attained a pliancy and a reach that enable me to assume any emotion I desire and enter at will into any state of mind.'For me, his flow of thoughts or dreaming that we read in The Book of Disquiet captures the writer\u2019s mind, reveals a structure and a repetition in thoughts that talks about solitude, dream, tedium, love or un-love and unhappiness. It is ultimately passionate and painful.Bernardo Soares is Pessoa\u2019s heteronym considered to be the closest to Pessoa\u2019s real self; and his writings strongly express Pessoa\u2019s aspiration to live an imagined life, as if in a dream, so as to forget his self in real life. He continually writes about his dreams, their nature and importance to his survival:'Live your life. Don\u2019t be lived by it. Right or wrong, happy or sad, be your own self. You can do this only by dreaming, because your real life, your human life, is the one that doesn\u2019t belong to you but to others. You must replace your life with your dreaming, concentrating only on dreaming perfectly. In all the acts of your real life, from that of being born to that of dying, you don\u2019t act \u2013 you\u2019re acted; you don\u2019t live \u2013 you\u2019re merely lived.'Rain frequently appear in his writings and it could be viewed as a symbol of his disquietude, his unrelenting dreaming that pours over his own existence. What a wistful and beautiful vision Pessoa gifts us:\u201cEach drop of rain is my failed life weeping in nature. There\u2019s something of my disquiet in the endless drizzle, then shower, then drizzle, then shower, through which the day\u2019s sorrow uselessly pours itself out over the earth. It rains and keeps raining. My soul is damp from hearing it. So much rain\u2026 My flesh is watery around my physical sensation of it.And he dialogues with the readers, but mainly he questions or even doubts himself and his own writing:'What will I be ten years from now, or even five? My friends say I'll be one of the greatest contemporary poets - they say this based on what I've written, not what I may yet write. But even if this is true, I have no idea what it will mean. I have no idea how it will taste. Perhaps glory tastes like death and futility, and triumph smells of rottenness.'The Book of Disquiet moved and overwhelmed me fiercely. Pessoa bit by bit immersed himself into my own self, made me wonder and tremble with his alluring and poignant words, much above a mere understanding. I perceived his disquiet, and I shared with him many uncertainties or yet his certainties. His solitude and his dreaming are written down in my soul and will certainly come back to me in the future. Ah, to be such a poet, what a dream and what sufferings! ___Other quotes\u2022 'I weep over my imperfect pages, but if future generations read them, they will be more touched by my weeping than by any imperfection I might have achieved, since perfection would have kept me from weeping and, therefore, from writing. Perfection never materializes.'\u2022 'When all by myself, I can think of all kinds of clever remarks, quick comebacks to what no one said, and flashes of witty sociability with nobody. But all of this vanishes when I face someone in the flesh: I lose my intelligence, I can no longer speak. Only my ghostly and imaginary friends, only the conversations I have in my dreams, are genuinely real and substantial, and in them intelligence like an image in a mirror.'\u2022 'I've undertaken every project imaginable. The Iliad composed by me had a structural logic in its organic linking of epodes such as Homer could never have achieved. The meticulous perfection my unwritten verses makes Virgil's precision look sloppy and Milton's power slack. My allegorical satires surpassed all of Swift's in the symbolic exactitude of their rigorously interconnected particular. How many Horaces I've been.'\u2022 'When I put away my artifices and lovingly arrange in a corner all my toys, words, images and phrases, so dear to me I feel like kissing them, then I become so small and innocuous, so alone in a room so large and sad, so profoundly sad.'\u2022 'Sadly I write in my quiet room, alone as I have always been, alone as I will always be. And I wonder if my apparently negligible voice might not embody the essence of thousands of voices, the longing of self-expression of thousands of lives, the patience of millions of souls resigned like my own to their daily lot, their useless dreams and their hopeless hopes.'\u2022 'I\u2019m dazed by a sarcastic terror of life, a despondency that exceeds the limits of my conscious being. I realize that I was all error and deviation, that I never lived, that I existed only in so far as I filled time with consciousness and thought. I feel, in this moment, like a man who wakes up after a slumber full of real dreams, or like a man freed by an earthquake from the dim light of the prison he\u2019d grown used to.'\u2022 'It sometimes occurs to me, with sad delight, that if one day (...) the sentences I write are read and admired, then at last I'll have my own kin, people who 'understand' me, my true family in which to be born and loved. But from being born into it, I'll have already died long ago. I'll be understood only in effigy, when affection can no longer compensate for the indifference that was the dead man's lot in life.'\u2022 'Not only am I dissatisfied with the poems I write now; I also know that I will be dissatisfied with the poems I write in the future...So why do I keep writing? Because I still haven't learned... I haven't been able to give up my inclination to poetry and prose. I have to write, as if I were carrying out a punishment. And the greatest punishment is to know that whatever I write will be futile, flawed and uncertain.'\u2022 'My state of mind compels me to work hard, against my will, on The Book of Disquiet. But it's all fragments, fragments, fragments...'____.", "1Some books wrap me up in dreams and fantasy, creating a protective bubble in which I can leisurely gaze at the world in comfort.

The opposite happened when reading \u201cThe Book of Disquiet\u201d, a book that lives up to its title like no other. I didn\u2019t get wrapped up in anything. With every sentence I read I felt myself being unwrapped, as layers of self-deceit and unconsciousness were shed. 2I held the book in my hands. I could decide to open and close it. I could decide to put it away. But despite all that it didn\u2019t take long for me to realise that I was not the one in power, as the book firmly grasped me in turn. Not through my mind, like good books. Not through my heart, like great books. It grasped my soul and never let go. While I was reading this book, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it had beaten me to it, in that the book was reading me and that it did so more quickly and effectively than I could read its pages. This book is a mirror for my soul, a mirror in which my reflection always sees me first, a mirror where my reflection waves to me and I wave back. 3I\u2019m compelled to take over the book\u2019s structure in this review, and that\u2019s not only because of Junta\u2019s shining example. There is no plot weaving together the pages. The book is made up of more than two hundred diary entries. But this is a special diary. The entries seldom talk of work, of interactions with other people, of the goings-on in the day. They deal with the author\u2019s rich inner life, to which the outside reality offers only a background at best. Pessoa sat down at his desk and just wrote what he thought. Streams of thoughts are often fragmentary, and so is this book. Every number allows a new idea to carry you through poetic landscapes until the author reaches the shores of that idea and he starts over, sometimes with a new idea, sometimes with the same, sometimes leading to the same shore, sometimes further away or closer by. As a result, my notes of my reactions to the book are equally fragmentary, each note representing a new stream as I glide to the next number and I start over. 4One of my favorite things to do is to stand in between two mirrors that stand directly opposite of each other. To see my reflection multiplied to infinity is the most humbling ego-boost I can think of. I say infinity but if you look far enough into that world of infinite reflections there is a dark hole at the end of it, there where the light ceases to reach and where my beholding eye ceases to behold. Consciousness is a mirror. Consciousness of consciousness leads to a similar infinity that seemingly leads to nothingness. 5Infinity sharpens my mind and elates my heart as a concept, but it numbs my mind and shrinks my heart as a reality. Nothingness is just one version of infinity. Equating everything to zero is the easiest solution to find, but the most difficult one to accept. 6I don\u2019t know if this book has changed my life. It added a layer of consciousness to my consciousness and makes me more aware of inner processes. On the other hand, it couldn\u2019t have done so if it didn\u2019t confirm my consciousness, if it didn\u2019t confirm what I already felt and knew without knowing. My soul was stripped of the comfort and warmth of the mundane, but already I feel myself slipping back into the world and out of myself. 7A connection feels meaningful when it is direct, goes deep and is complete. 8Dreams I\u2019ve never bothered to write down, thoughts and follies that were interrupted: much of what I have said, written and thought is lost. Only the abstract memory of having said, written and thought lingers. Before I go to sleep, thoughts wash over me, turning around in my head, taking five paths at once and dancing in harmony. The mind is cleared and cleansed with these high-speed thought-cycles but then, a jolt of consciousness, the spell is broken and the thoughts are forever lost, hiding away in dreams. The heavy weight of consciousness doesn\u2019t last as another torrent of thoughts sweeps down and I fall into a peaceful sleep. How I would like to commit those thoughts to paper, to catch the wild torrents and be at peace. 9In my mind\u2019s eye a castle is easily conjured up, the atmosphere is palpable, the potential for storytelling enormous. I pick up my pen. The jester is no longer a concept, but a living thing in need of adventures and adjectives. The scene becomes heavy and slow and I grind to a halt. 10An unlikable side-effect of my consciousness is that I can\u2019t help but feel special. That feeling doesn\u2019t start at the cerebral level. Somewhere in the depths of my diaphragm there is this core, a source of that intuition. Sometimes that core is cold and the feeling fades, but this book made it burn brightly. I look at the reviews page and I see that it did so for others. My feeling special makes way for a special feeling. 11Like Pessoa, I find a lot of philosophy in the exceedingly small. That which does not matter, matters precisely because of it. When I look at an ant hard at work, I find that its essence is its being. This goes for everything, but it is in the insignficant that this is made the most obvious to me. A blade of grass sticking out of the pavement. Small numbers written in pencil on a wall that now have lost all significance. A bug. An abandoned shack that has fallen in disuse. I was hiking in a wild, rough coastal region in France. On the sandy path there was a small patch of pebbles and I resolved to pick one up and throw it into the sea far below when I'd get close enough. During my walk I thought about what had brought the pebble to that patch, what had brought me there, and as ever, one thought led to the other. The pebble became heavy with my ponderings. I could not bring myself to throw it into the anonymity of the crashing waves when the time came. 12  13Whenever I find wonder in the banal, nothingness becomes less likely. Banality is a virtue, importance is a sin. There is no wonder in importance, only design.The situation of the spider crawling on my book only a few moments after I had read the small chapter on \"millimeters\" held wonder, but the picture I took was designed, flipping back to the relevant page so that spider could walk on it. It felt important to share the moment so I turned wonder into an anecdote.14Sometimes reality feels like the dream that my inaction brought to fruition. Sometimes reality feels like the remnants in the sieve through which my dreams are poured..", "Job: \u201cMy soul is weary of my life.\u201dPessoa/Soares: \u201cI'd woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist.\u201d Pessoa/Soares: \u201cI write because I don\u2019t know.\u201dYou are planning a party; here\u2019s your guest list:Dostoevsky\u2019s Raskolnikov (from Crime and Punishment)Melville\u2019s \u201cBartelby the Scrivener\u201dKafka\u2019s Gregor Samsa (from The Metamorphosis) Joyce\u2019s Stephan Dedalus (from The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man)Camus\u2019s Merseault (from The Stranger)Beckett\u2019s MolloySartre\u2019s Roquentin (from NauJob: \u201cMy soul is weary of my life.\u201dPessoa/Soares: \u201cI'd woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist.\u201d Pessoa/Soares: \u201cI write because I don\u2019t know.\u201dYou are planning a party; here\u2019s your guest list:Dostoevsky\u2019s Raskolnikov (from Crime and Punishment)Melville\u2019s \u201cBartelby the Scrivener\u201dKafka\u2019s Gregor Samsa (from The Metamorphosis) Joyce\u2019s Stephan Dedalus (from The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man)Camus\u2019s Merseault (from The Stranger)Beckett\u2019s MolloySartre\u2019s Roquentin (from Nausea)I'm a comics guy, too, so let's let in Noah Van Sciver (who wrote Disquiet [I suspect naming it with Pessoa in mind] and a comics biography, The Hypo: The Melancholic Young Lincoln)Hmm, maybe you also invite Hamlet (for some historical perspective) to recite his \u201cTo be or not to be. . . \u201c soliloquy as entertainment, or have Macbeth say out his speech at the party opening, \u201cTomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day. . .\u201dAnd you will add your own literary grumps, when you begin to pick up the pattern of this literary party guest list. Some fun, eh? What\u2019s a good party game for this bunch, Russian Roulette? My list above is all male, but I also just read (8/21) Anna Kavan's Asylum Piece, so I could make another list of just women, too, of course.I just met someone who is a perfect addition to the guest list, Bernardo Soares, from Ferdinand Pessoa\u2019s Book of Disquiet published in 1982, 47 years after his death at 47 in 1935. What do they have in common, the characters on our guest list? All men, yep. Men largely living without women. And many of them alone, even if they live with others. Sad, sad men. Melancholic. Intense. Maybe today we would psychologically diagnose some of them as bipolar or neurologically diagnose them as autistic/Asperger Syndrome or philosophically diagnose them as nihilist?So what does Soares, a mild assistant bookkeeper, bring to the party that we don\u2019t already have? Well, for one, he\u2019s Portuguese, from Lisbon, and The Rua dos Douradores, where he lives and works and eats alone in one solitary restaurant night after night. Soares\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d\u2014never to be finished, based on scraps of paper Pessoa threw in a trunk, edited and arranged by Richard Zenith with loving care\u2014is mainly a collection of aphorisms and philosophical reflections and psychological insights with respect to Soares\u2019s experience of \u201cdisquiet,\u201d which I take to be a psychological condition akin to depression, ennui, and alienation, but which also seems to be a kind of existentialist statement. Some people think Pessoa\u2019s Book of Disquiet makes of Lisbon what Joyce\u2019s works make of Dublin, or Kafka\u2019s works make of Prague. The difference? Joyce\u2019s novel is a narrative, and Disquiet actually resists narrative in most respects. It resists coherence, completion, and is a kind of deconstructionist, meta-fictional precursor to postmodernism. Resistant to logic. Often absurd. I don\u2019t think it is for everyone, especially if you want to read a good old-fashioned story, but it does create a portrait of an interesting character, and it does have some of the most beautiful and insightful sentences you will ever read in a book. Many people list it as one of the greatest works of fiction of all time, and I won\u2019t say nay to that, but I think as he never finished it, most readers won\u2019t finish it, either. Would Pessoa care if we finished it? What does it mean to \"finish\" or not finish any book, especially this one? The basic move Pessoa makes to convey \u201cdisquiet\u201d is a set of repeated paralyzing contradictions, inversions, circularities or oxymorons, which can also seem very darkly funny: \u201c. . . the stoicism of the weak.\u201d\u201cThough naturally ambitious, he savored the pleasure of having no ambitions at all.\u201d\u201cConsoler of the inconsolable, Tears of those who never cry, Hour that never sounds \u2014 free me from joy and happiness.\u201d\u201cTo give love is to lose love.\u201d\u201cOnly unhappiness raises us up.\u201d\u201cMy joy is as painful as my grief.\u201d\u201cSince we can't extract beauty from life, let's at least try to extract beauty from not being able to extract beauty from life.\u201dAnd on and on, delightfully and sometimes painfully so.The Book of Soares\u2019s Disquiet is a portrait of melancholy, of isolation:\u201cI am not a pessimist, I am merely sad.\u201d\u201cI aspire to nothing. Life wounds me.\u201d\u201cDo not make the infantile mistake of asking the meaning of things and words. Nothing has any meaning.\u201d\u201c. . . the chance circumstances of his life and the direction it had taken were dictated by his instincts, in his case inertia and detachment.\u201d\u201cMy past is everything I failed to be.\u201d \u201cI feel as if I'm always on the verge of waking up.\u201d \u201cI'm sick of everything, and of the everythingness of everything.\u201d \u201cI've always rejected being understood. To be understood is to prostitute oneself. I prefer to be taken seriously for what I'm not, remaining humanly unknown, with naturalness and all due respect.\u201d  \u201c. . . the stagnant jewel of my ecstatic disdain.\u201dSoares in his spare time keeps a journal of sorts, though we have no idea when he wrote what he wrote. Writing and reading do sustain him, in a way. \u201cThere are metaphors more real than the people who walk in the street. There are images tucked away in books that live more vividly than many men and women. There are phrases from literary works that have a positively human personality.\u201dBut writing is also not self-discovery so much as it is self-erasure:\u201cTo write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.\u201d \u201cI write because I don\u2019t know.\u201d {but not that he now expects to know; see above where life has no meaning to discover]And he\u2019s also sustained by dreaming (which is of course related to reading and writing):\u201cI never tried to be anything other than a dreamer. I never paid any attention to people who told me to go out and live. I belonged always to whatever was far from me and to whatever I could never be. Anything that was not mine, however base, always seemed to be full of poetry.\u201d\u201cI've never done anything but dream. This, and this alone, has been the meaning of my life. My only real concern has been my inner life.\u201dBut as with writing, there's also the flip side of dreaming:\u201cThe only important fact for me is the fact that I exist and that I suffer and cannot entirely dream myself out of feeling that suffering.\u201d\u201cTheir way of dreaming is a garment that conceals, not a dream that creates.\u201dAnd he's alone:\u201cWe never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It's our own concept\u2014our own selves\u2014that we love.\u201dI want to share a longer section, just so you can get a better feel of Soares:\u201cToday, suddenly, I reached an absurd but unerring conclusion. In a moment of enlightenment, I realized that I'm nobody, absolutely nobody. When the lightning flashed, I saw that what I had thought to be a city was in fact a deserted plain and, in the same sinister light that revealed me to myself, there seemed to be no sky above it. I was robbed of any possibility of having existed before the world. If I was ever reincarnated, I must have done so without myself, without a self to reincarnate.I am the outskirts of some non-existent town, the long-winded prologue to an unwritten book. I'm nobody, nobody. I don't know how to feel or think or love. I'm a character in a novel as yet unwritten, hovering in the air and undone before I've even existed, amongst the dreams of someone who never quite managed to breathe life into me.I'm always thinking, always feeling, but my thoughts lack all reason, my emotions all feeling. I'm falling through a trapdoor, through infinite, infinitous space, in a directionless, empty fall. My soul is a black maelstrom, a great madness spinning about a vacuum, the swirling of a vast ocean around a hole in the void, and in the waters, more like whirlwinds than waters, float images of all I ever saw or heard in the world: houses, faces, books, boxes, snatches of music and fragments of voices, all caught up in a sinister, bottomless whirlpool.\u201dWe are left with this explosion of dolorous language, \u201cthose feelings that inhabit the gloom of my wearinesses and the grottoes of my disquiets.\u201dThe Book of Disquiet raises questions about the nature of authorship in that, while it is technically authored by Pessoa, it is credited to one of his several heteronyms, Bernardo Soares, assistant bookkeeper. Who is Pessoa? He\u2019s not a stable, unified person, but multiple and fractured. Pessoa was known primarily as a poet with several titles under several different names. The whole idea most of ascribe to of an author's \"voice\" is clearly undermined by Pessoa. He leaves us with fragments of literature and identity. As Soares says, I feel \u201cThe vast indifference of the stars.\u201d Seems like he and Hamlet and Beckett and Camus would have a lot not to talk about at your party..", "\"I follow the course of my dreams, making them images into steps toward other images; folding casual metaphors like fans into grand pictures of interior vision; I untie life from myself, and I toss it aside as if it were a too-tight suit.\"- Fernando Pessoa, The Book of DisquietYou know a writer is great when he makes you want to learn a new language to understand his work in the original. \"The Book of Disquiet\" is easily the best book I've read this year, and possibly the one I've copied the mo \"I follow the course of my dreams, making them images into steps toward other images; folding casual metaphors like fans into grand pictures of interior vision; I untie life from myself, and I toss it aside as if it were a too-tight suit.\"- Fernando Pessoa, The Book of DisquietYou know a writer is great when he makes you want to learn a new language to understand his work in the original. \"The Book of Disquiet\" is easily the best book I've read this year, and possibly the one I've copied the most quotes from. I'd only ever read Pessoa's poetry and I had no idea what to expect from his prose. It turns out he does poetry and prose equally well.I would love to have a conversation with Pessoa, although I would probably be an annoyance to him with his desire for solitude. But having a deep, philosophical conversation with him would be like a dream. He has such fascinating thoughts! He delves into the complexity of humans and helped me to understand the reason for his several heteronyms in his poetry: \"Each of us is various, many people, a prolixity of selves.\"  I feel that this is the sort of book that people will either think is brilliant or they will think Pessoa is too sentimental and sensitive. I have to say that I rarely come across a writer who thinks so deeply and obsessively about certain things. Pessoa's favourite topics seem to be dreams, solitude, writing, the futility of life (was he an existentialist? He reminds me a bit of Meursault). I may share Pessoa's melancholy to some extent but I don't share his negative outlook, his depression and his misanthropic nature! Even so, this was a brilliant book and one I'm so glad I finally read.Pessoa's writing really consumed me at times. Definitely a book to be savoured, and a candidate for a re-read. \"When I write, I visit myself solemnly. I have special rooms, remembered by someone else in the interstices of my self-representation, where I take pleasure in analyzing what I do not feel, and I examine myself as if I were a painting in the shadows.\" .", "If I write what I feel, it\u2019s to reduce the fever of feeling.

This is the story of a man who lived a thousand lives and wrote about the fragile boundary between reality and dreaming with the most beautiful and heartbreaking prose I've ever encountered.I wanted to read this book for a long time. When I found it, I did something I try not to do: I skimmed it. I wanted to see something before my better judgment had control over my literary anxiety. Before I knew, I found myself reading a mesmerizing passage that I couldn't leave until I finished it.Lucid DiaryMy life: a tragedy booed off stage by the gods, never getting beyond the first act.Friends: not one. Just a few acquaintances who imagine they feel something for me and who might be sorry if a train ran over me and the funeral was on a rainy day.

There\u2019s an aureole of indifference, an icy halo, that surrounds me and repels others. I still haven\u2019t succeeded in not suffering from my solitude. It\u2019s hard to achieve that distinction of spirit whereby isolation becomes a repose without anguish... (579)From that moment, I just knew it was going to be an extremely emotional experience. Whoever said that reading is a passive activity, never found a book with the power of taking his soul out for a ride.What a book. I could relate to almost every word. Every yearning for something that could never happen. Every loss that did happen. Every thought made by a restless mind. And every feeling conceived by an isolated heart longing for an endless dream. A cure. Redemption. Or nothing.The melancholic beauty of his prose and the heartbreaking honesty of his sorrow made me feel too small. And relieved. Suddenly, many of my thoughts and feelings were exposed in those pages that I was never able to write. And he did it. Pessoa did it with the most exquisite language you could ever hope to find. The atmosphere is filled with an overwhelming sense of failure and frustration.I envy \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure that I envy \u2013 those for whom a biography could be written, or who could write their own. In these random impressions, and with no desire to be other than random, I indifferently narrate my factless autobiography, my lifeless history. These are my Confessions, and if in them I say nothing, it\u2019s because I have nothing to say. (42)Each drop of rain is my failed life weeping in nature. There\u2019s something of my disquiet in the endless drizzle, then shower, then drizzle, then shower, through which the day\u2019s sorrow uselessly pours itself out over the earth.It rains and keeps raining. My soul is damp from hearing it. So much rain... (177)Solitude. Solitude devastates me; company oppresses me. (80)Again, fluid and uncertain, the rain pattered. Time dragged to its accompaniment. My soul\u2019s solitude grew and spread, invading what I felt, what I wanted, and what I was going to dream. The room\u2019s hazy objects, which shared my insomnia in the shadows, moved with their sadness into my desolation. (285)Uncertainties.And so, not knowing how to believe in God and unable to believe in an aggregate of animals, I, along with other people on the fringe, kept a distance from things... Could it think, the heart would stop beating. (30)I've never had anyone I could call \u2018Master\u2019. No Christ died for me. No Buddha showed me the way. No Apollo or Athena, in my loftiest dreams, ever appeared to enlighten my soul. (533)And many other displays of human nature. Devastating situations that contrast themselves with the lyrical beauty of this man's writing.His crude words are still little sunbeams that could enlighten the obscure depths of our souls, only if we let them. In that so human selfishness of ours, we always think nobody is suffering more than we do. We are the only ones struggling to survive in this world that we never asked for. Well, we are not; that is not an extraordinary epiphany. But reading the words of a man whose thoughts are so familiar to us always represents an inspirational experience. We feel like we just found the necessary balm to soothe our pain. That is the healing power of understanding. Of empathy. We are not alone. We never were. Like Soares in this book, I am acquainted with isolation more than I would have wanted to. I breathe it. I am made of it. And still, somehow, I am not alone. A breath of music or of a dream, of something that would make me almost feel, something that would make me not think. (57)Being fatally sensitive can be exhausting and a perpetual cause of sorrow. But the so-desired inability to feel resembles to being dead inside a living body. Human existence doesn't limit itself to some functional organs. Feeling nothing is not the answer. You might as well be truly dead.So, yes. This book is my newest treasure. My diary and sanctuary. I can't help but to be grateful. It filled my head with many questions that I wish I could find the answers by myself.What to do when we are forced to leave the safe place our dreams represent? Can they make us do it? Will we ever find the strength enough to face the world? Do we have to? Do we dare?I sleep when I dream of what doesn't exist; dreaming of what might exist wakes me up. (179)Life should be about finding a sane balance between reality and fantasy. That reminds me of something I found the other day. I don't know if the following words really belong to Pizarnik\u2014they sure sound like her\u2014and since I couldn't find them in English, I kind of translated them. Trust me, they are too beautiful in Spanish. So, I apologize in advance. I am simply not from this world... I frenziedly dwell in the moon. I am not afraid of dying; I am afraid of this foreign, aggressive land...I cannot think about specific things; I am not interested. I cannot speak like everybody else. My words are foreign, they come from far away... What will I do when I plunge myself in my wildest dreams and cannot ascend? Because that is going to happen, eventually. I will go and I won't know how to come back. Moreover, I will not know that there is a \"coming back\". I will not want it, perhaps.No. Pessoa was not alone.According to this book, Soares was not a pessimist. He was sad. He suffered and dreamed. And he complained without knowing if suffering was the norm, if he deserved it for some reason. However, he rejoiced in the fact that he could play with his complaints and made them musical because he was an artist. He could give beauty to his complaints and dreams. But, if you can't do that, if you are not an artist... well. What then?Note: I read the English (Zenith) and Spanish (Crespo) translations at the same time. I prefer the English one.Apr 27, 14* Also on my blog.** Other reviews: A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems The Selected Prose of Fernando PessoaThe Education of the Stoic El Banquero Anarquista (written in Spanish).", "(Almost finished.)\u201ca factless autobiography\u201dVivid.

One cannot read this book of fragmentary thoughts as quickly as one would others, for instead of plot or story, one finds style and syntax that reveal the human condition and psyche. So I read this one intentionally, wishing it would go on and on. Our protagonist and \u201cvoice\u201d is that that of the solitary and observant older man, a writer who has never known the affections of childhood because he lost both his parents at a young age. What it must feel like to be loved, to feel the warmth of a mother\u2019s hug, he ponders. He has never been in love, nor has he had any friends. In fact, he\u2019s never had ambition, only his imagination and dreams:Between myself and life there have always been panes of opaque glass, undetectable to me by sight or touch; I never actually lived life according to a plan, I was the daydream of what I wanted to be, my dream began in my will, my goal was always the first fiction of what I never was.It is said that we learn more about life when we write, that we find ourselves within our prose (especially memoir writers). As I write this, I understand more about myself, and as I read his words, I realize that he and I are nothing alike, and yet we have so much in common:I am, for the most part, the very prose that I write. I shape myself in periods and paragraphs, I punctuate myself and, in the unleashed chain of images, I make myself king, as children do, with a crown of made from a sheet of newspaper or, in finding rhythms in mere strings of words, I garland myself, as madmen do, with dried flowers that in my dreams still live.This is the beauty of poignant prose, when we find pieces of ourselves within it. Someone should have given me this book years ago, when I was a teenager in a new country, recovering from war and struggling to find myself in a new world of structured freedom. Back then, I was living in tedium, as the narrator puts it. My new world was invigorating, yet scary, this idea that I could walk the streets freely (and not have to keep myself secluded from men and guns), that I could attend public high schools and apply for federal aid for college, that I could go to a library and read any book\u2014better yet, buy books freely and form my very own library? Although this was great, it was also painful, to be faced with the realization that this world had existed even while I'd been in a different world of imprisonment. I never knew how to verbalize that pain until now:The pain of not understanding the mystery of life, the pain of being unloved, the pain of others\u2019 injustice to us, the pain of life crushing us, suffocating and imprisoning us\u2026To live in tedium is to die while still being alive, even while believing in staying alive: \"Life chills me. My existence is all damp caves and dark catacombs.\" To live in tedium is to hope for a second chance at life, where one can do the things one has always imagined doing. This is the core expression of this book, I believe, this art of mastering self-consciousness. The book is a solemn but necessary read, this is why I\u2019ve recommended it to my students who are war survivors and to my veteran students who have just returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. And this is also why I would recommend it to anyone who is frustrated by, yet still fascinated with this thing called life. These pages are the doodles of my intellectual consciousness of myself. I set them down in a torpor of feeling, like a cat in the sun, and re-read them at times with a dull, belated pang, as if remembering something I had always previously forgotten..", "\u201cMy soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, what fiddlestrings and harps, drums and tamboura I sound and clash inside myself.

So while he did create 81 heteronyms* , each distinctly dissimilar in their style, we do not yet know who Pessoa actually was or what he believed in. Fernando Pessoa, strictly speaking, doesn\u2019t exist.*Pessoa called this work as his \u201cfactless biography\u201d I also came across the words \u201cPsychography\u201d and \u201cgeography of self awareness\u201d for the book. In my opinion, it has distinct tones of the absurd, and can be looked upon as an absurdist writing albeit on an altogether different level, though the hints of stoicism and cynicism are apparently evident too. You will not notice the \u201cbabble/despair\u201d - characteristic of Beckett\u2019s writing or \u201cRational absurd\u201d (view spoiler)[(My opinion, but I am not sure if there is such a term) (hide spoiler)] - quintessential trait of Camus\u2019 writing, but a willful approach towards attaining the disquietude because his consciousness is a tedium resulting from the conclusion of senselessness of existence; an existence not of this world or life but his life.  \u201cIt sometimes happens, more or less suddenly, that in the midst of my sensations I\u2019m overwhelmed by such a terrible weariness of life that I can\u2019t even conceive of any act that might relieve it. Suicide seems a dubious remedy, and natural death \u2013 even assuming it brings unconsciousness \u2013 an insufficient one. Rather than the cessation of my existence, which may or may not be possible, this weariness makes me long for something far more horrifying and profound: never to have existed at all, which is definitely impossible.\u201d His conviction of being a passer-by reminds me of Beckett\u2019s belief of being a passer-by who finds himself over and over again (The Unnameable).\u201cThis is my morality, or metaphysics, or me: passer-by of everything, even of my own soul, I belong to nothing, I desire nothing, I am nothing \u2013 just an abstract center of impersonal sensations, a fallen sentient mirror reflecting the world\u2019s diversity. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m happy this way. Nor do I care.\u201dTo overcome the anguish of life which he is so acutely aware of, he engages in imagination and dreaming. Perhaps this is the reason he created so many personalities, so as to be able to experience different lives within him. In fact, his approach is distinct in the sense that he is not only aware of his sensations, but he also exercises a control over them which is clearly visible from the number of heteronyms he created for himself, who could each write in distinct literary styles. According to him:\u201cMy intellect has attained a pliancy and a reach that enable me to assume any emotion I desire and enter at will into any state of mind.\u201d*This writing, which is a compilation of over 500 fragments, where each fragment, written perhaps on different days, seemingly an attempt at expressing the flow of thoughts or imagination capturing writer\u2019s mind, does seem to have a structure in thoughts and more than often talks about solitude, dream, tedium and rain. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to describe what I feel when I feel I really exist and my soul is a real entity that I don\u2019t know what human words could define it. I don\u2019t know if I have a fever, as I feel I do, or if I\u2019ve stopped having the fever of sleeping through life. Yes, I repeat, I\u2019m like a traveller who suddenly finds himself in a strange town, without knowing how he got there, which makes me think of those who lose their memory and for a long time are not themselves but someone else. I was someone else for a long time\u2013since birth and consciousness \u2013and suddenly I\u2019ve woken up in the middle of a bridge, leaning over the river and knowing that I exist more solidly than the person I was up till now. But the city is unknown to me, the streets are new, and the trouble has no cure. And so, leaning over the bridge, I wait for the truth to go away and let me return to being fictitious and non-existent, intelligent and natural.\u201dKeeping in mind that this work is written by Bernardo Soares, the heteronym considered to be the closest to Pessoa\u2019s real self, these lines acutely express Pessoa\u2019s yearning to live an imagined life, as if in a dream, so as to forget his actual self in real life. He writes about his dreams, their nature and importance and goes as far as giving advice regarding them:\u201cLive your life. Don\u2019t be lived by it. Right or wrong, happy or sad, be your own self. You can do this only by dreaming, because your real life, your human life, is the one that doesn\u2019t belong to you but to others. You must replace your life with your dreaming, concentrating only on dreaming perfectly. In all the acts of your real life, from that of being born to that of dying, you don\u2019t act \u2013 you\u2019re acted; you don\u2019t live \u2013 you\u2019re merely lived.\u201d(Art of effective dreaming II)Rain, which frequently appears in the text, seems a symbol of the incessant thoughts, pouring over writer\u2019s mind and submerging his awareness in the disquiet that he experiences:\u201cEach drop of rain is my failed life weeping in nature. There\u2019s something of my disquiet in the endless drizzle, then shower, then drizzle, then shower, through which the day\u2019s sorrow uselessly pours itself out over the earth. It rains and keeps raining. My soul is damp from hearing it. So much rain\u2026 My flesh is watery around my physical sensation of it.\u201d ( Rainy Landscape)He profoundly expresses his tedium in words when he experiences it and also present to us different situations where one may feel tedium:\u201cTedium\u2026 Perhaps, deep down, it is the soul\u2019s dissatisfaction because we didn\u2019t give it a belief, the disappointment of the sad child (who we are on the inside) because we didn\u2019t buy it the divine toy. Perhaps it is the insecurity of one who needs a guiding hand and who doesn\u2019t feel, on the black path of profound sensation, anything more than the soundless night of not being able to think, the empty road of not being able to feel\u2026\u201d And what is still more astonishing is that though he wrote these fragments in solitude, over perhaps a decade or more, he wrote it as a dialogue between him and the future reader, allowing for either acceptance or rejection on the part of reader. And I offer you this book because I know it is beautiful and useless. It teaches nothing, inspires no faith, and stirs no feeling. A mere stream that follows towards an abyss of ashes scattered by the wind, neither helping nor harming the soil..... I put my whole soul into making it, but without thinking about it as I made it, for I thought only of me, who am sad, and of you, who aren\u2019t anyone. And because this book is absurd, I love it; because it is useless, I want to give it away; and because it serves no purpose to want to give it to you, I give it to you\u2026As I conclude my review, I want to admit that this book overwhelmed me immensely, I witnessed Pessoa seeping inside me slowly, making me quiver with the words he spoke to me, more as I understood them. Perceiving the disquiet which so fiercely plagued him, the solitude that he opted to dream to somehow conquer it, but still returning to the unrest because he understood the futility, made his thoughts trace through my mind, linger there for sometime before finally coming home to me. But my effort at writing a more personal review didn\u2019t ensue because if written, it would have been nothing but babble. I am yet to complete reading Philosophical essays by Pessoa and the poems he wrote by the name of Albert Caeiro, but still I feel privileged to place him on the altar alongside Camus and Beckett. ---------------------------------------*source - wikipedia*Written by his creation, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, Notes for the Memory of My Master Caeiro (Editorial Estampa, 1997).*From a \u201cPersonal note\u201d, 1910.", "Heternonymy 101This be possibly the biggest, most self indulgent pre-PoMo existential angst wank fest.

He\u2019s worse than I am on the rag.  Pessoa wallows in misery like a pig in shit. \u2018Cause some people get off on that type of thing. And if there is no misery to be found at hand, a malaise will be conjured, like a bunny out of a magician\u2019s hat. Think I\u2019m messing?

Exactly what the hell is that supposed to mean? Is it like, white man\u2019s disease? Here is Pessoa\u2019s real problem in life: he\u2019s in love with himself. It unrequited. He does nothing all day, every day, except gaze upon his navel , like an overbloated narcissistic hypochondriac, and bleats about it like a little girl.I\u2019ve got two words, mister: Heteronymy PHI don\u2019t know what that crazy bitch is going on about up there. Its not even two words, is it? And Oben and uten? Puhlease. What the fcuk is that? Some people should just stick to 50 shades of grey and leave the big boys to those (e.g. us) who can appreciate a finely tuned study of the self. Because this genre has not really been attempted before: a prolific, no holds barred, intense and microscopic examination of the \u2018self\u2019, pared down to its core and microscopically dissected over the scope of thirty years: an elegiac etude of states of consciousness, terpischoreanily spanning the circle of life with juxtaposing nuances of acceptance and rejection, always seeking to align the individual with the vast cosmos of uncertainty, loneliness and dissonance of meaning which life throws our way. At times ebullient with joy, at times succumbed with sadness, this understated tapestry of febrile ruminations is sure to strike a chord with everyone at certain meeting points: particularly moments when the divide between self and others runs deepest. What idiot on this earth does not question the meaning of life and crawl into a deep hole to lick away the wounds of a quotidian existence? Pessoa is a master dissector of the soul, and its multi-faceted permutations, a paladin of negation and confirmation, a harbinger of death and phoenixing. Sublime.Heteronymy shteronymyHoly Shit I just don\u2019t ken. They\u2019re both right. What the hell, who cares.

It\u2019s a groundbreaking work of Modernist experimentation that consists of a collection of writings found on disorganized scraps of paper in a chest found in the author\u2019s home after his death. These scraps were assembled into a book for the first time in the 1960s. Pessoa, who was Portuguese, wrote the segments over the course of the last twenty years of his life, which ended in 1935.Pessoa invented multiple personas for himself that he called heteronyms, and each of his novels or collections of poetry was written from the perspective of an alter ego. He essentially invented multiple authors and wrote from their perspective. It\u2019s a distinct approach from having a character narrate a novel, especially when it comes to writing a collection of poetry, but even in this \u201cnovel\u201d because there is no plot to speak of, only an internal landscape. Pessoa makes no effort to distinguish his own critique of the \u201cauthor\u2019s opinions,\u201d he merely embodies them. In other words, there is no authorial distance, no \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d theme, there is only the narrator. It is as if Pessoa had a multiple personality disorder in artistic form. The collection of writings in this book are measures of the interior life of one Bernardo Soares, which Pessoa described as being a \u201cmutilated version\u201d of himself, but perhaps the closest to his own beliefs of all his heteronyms. He describes Soares as rather like \u201chimself minus the affection.\u201d Indeed, Soares comes across as so purely intellectual (although he does have the occasional overwhelming emotional response to small occurrences) that he is rather distant and cold\u2014completely self-absorbed and narcissistic, in fact. Soares lives a life that is almost entirely metaphysical. In one of the 276 segments in the book, he refers to this collection as a \u201cbook of disconnected impressions.\u201d Some might say that this isn\u2019t a novel! But in the case of what is important to Soares (or to Pessoa), intellectual thought is apparently the only process that sustains his life. It is the story of his life, which was very little but intellectual.We get glimpses of this persona at work, as an accountant poring over ledgers (which is what Pessoa did as well), and walking the streets of Lisbon, but for the most part, nothing ever happens. Soares lives a life only in his mind and in his daydreams. He is scared and reluctant to say hello or even shake hands with others. It is too shocking, too much for him. Much like Proust who wrote an entire series of book triggered by the taste of a single Madeleine cookie, Soares believes that an artist must be able to wring the greatest emotional effect out of the smallest incidents. So why write of large incidents when small ones suffice?What subjects does Soares ponder as we make our way through this book? What is the book about? Walking and weather. Fame and ambition, rain and dreams. Banality, the banality of existence. Change or the lack there of. Dreams, especially dreams. Work. God. Writing and art. Identity and being.At times he can seem quite humble, or more precisely, assured of his own inadequacy and contemptuous of himself, believing that everything he writes is worthless and a failure, railing at his own\u2014and by proxy, every writers\u2019\u2014inability to truly represent ideas or thoughts in words (this being quite reminiscent of Wittgenstein\u2019s view that language mediates our understanding of reality). Yet other times he can seem utterly arrogant in his narcissism. Other people are merely props for his internal dreams and thinking, and in fact he boldly declares at one point, \u201c\u2026 of what importance is to me what life is to other people?\u201d Because, he would say, we can only live life from our own perspective and to attempt \u201cempathy\u201d is a delusion. Other people aren\u2019t even real to any of us\u2014except as dreams.* Sometimes this seems almost Buddhist\u2014we are dreaming life and because all is change, nothing is real and all there is is nothing. \u201cThe self is nothing more than all it is thinking in the moment.\u201d Other times, it comes across as clearly Nietzschean, which would seem close to Pessoa's own ideology because he was a royalist of sorts. Soares believes that humans want to be enslaved not free. He has certain fascist tendencies that peek through his primarily apolitical musings. For example, he declares himself both anti-revolutionary and anti-reformist. Much like Nietzsche who sought to create amoral \u00fcbermen, he is anti-social and believes that pursuing matters of social justice are not only a waste of time, but also a false presumption of pride and ambition in the self, to shape society. Furthermore, such actions support the premise that other people are \u201creal\u201d when in fact they are only dreams.** And then on the flipside of this, humans are unimportant and vulgar animals anyway: \"Life disgusts me.\" When he talks about work, he seems to say that work (not artist work, but paid commercial work) is an opportunity to become nothing\u2014a mere tool, a non-thing\u2014and to Soares, this is good, this is the enslavement that people want. The more the self can vanish as meaningless, the better. He criticizes ambition to \u201cdo something better\u201d as pure vanity.How can I give this book four stars when there are such disagreeable elements? Well, firstly, one doesn\u2019t have to agree with everything in a book philosophically to find it a great book. Sometimes, finding a point of view that one can disagree with is just as valuable. And secondarily, he spends most of the book pondering apolitical questions on the nature of perception, emotion, and identity revealing brilliant bon mots that remind me of Montaigne such as, \u201cThere is nothing that shows poverty of mind more quickly than not knowing how to be witty except at the expense of others.\u201d Admittedly, I did feel at times as though I were slogging through an ambiguous fog that didn\u2019t quite make sense, but then I would come to a burst of insight like a spotlight that illuminates the way. In the end, these insights (whether they be about life in general, or whether they gave me insights into certain types of people with tendencies like the narrator), were often profound enough to elevate this book to quite a high status.All in all, this book will only appeal to those readers comfortable with deep thoughts lacking a plot, and willing to persevere, but the rewards can be great.*I counter this by noting that if everything is a dream and everyone is a dream then all that matters is dreams and empathy for dreams is just as valid as non-empathy for dreams. **It\u2019s important to recognize that someone is always shaping society\u2014those who are already in power. Therefore, in fact, passively supporting the status quo is just as much a political action as resisting the status quo.

There were times I'd get so frustrated that I'd slap a one star review on it and toss the book across the room. But months later the book would call me back to the dreary disquiet of the narrator. At times the book amazed me on how beautiful and insightful the narrator's random musings were. At other times it sent me into a black hole of depression and I would have to take a break, sometimes for weeks at a time. The narrator often talks of tedium which I chose to interpret his version of depression.  Tedium is not the disease of being bored because there's nothing to do, but the more serious disease of feeling that there's nothing worth doing.During my bouts with battling depression, I've often felt much as the narrator does which made it too painful to read at times. But another part of me would say \" Yes,yes,yes! He gets it.\"I recommend this book but I want to preface by saying that if you suffer from depression, avoid this book until you're in a better headspace because this book will make the bleak outlook much darker if you read it during that time. On the other hand it can be quite poignant and beautiful. Fernando Pessoa died 86 years ago today and it amazes me that although this book might be too real to read, it's somewhat comforting to know that 86 years ago, someone was suffering from the same pain that plagues me.My habits are of solitude, not of men.", "Like a Version (Touched for the Very First Time)This is an exceptional book or work or whatever you want to call it.However, ultimately, I found it both fascinating and (just a little bit) frustrating.One source of frustration is that, upon completing it, I discovered that the version I had read (translated by Margaret Jull Costa) was 262 pages, whereas the Penguin Classics version (translated by Richard Zenith) is 544 pages.

Nothing had forewarned me oLike a Version (Touched for the Very First Time)This is an exceptional book or work or whatever you want to call it.However, ultimately, I found it both fascinating and (just a little bit) frustrating.One source of frustration is that, upon completing it, I discovered that the version I had read (translated by Margaret Jull Costa) was 262 pages, whereas the Penguin Classics version (translated by Richard Zenith) is 544 pages. I hate it when this happens. I feel duped. Nothing had forewarned me of this possibility.Readers have different views on the merits of the translations. I was perfectly happy with the quality of the text in the version I read (plus I love the cover!). However, the sheer difference in length has made me question whether and, if so, how much, text was omitted from the earlier version. This might not be such a big deal. If indeed there is a difference in the amount of text, I imagine that much of it might have replicated what was included in the original version. There is already considerable duplication in the work. Alternatively, it might have consisted of complementary material, the absence of which did not detract from the content of the original version.Regardless, the fact that this issue occurred at all points to another cause of my frustration.Fragments from under the FloorboardsBoth versions of the work have been presented to the reader as if it was a novel. It's even suggested that it's one of the great Modernist novels of the 20th Century.I don't want to be precious about the definition of the word \"novel\". As far as I'm concerned, if the author thinks their work is a novel, that's good enough for me.However, here, the work as a whole (in whatever version) has been assembled by a team of experts and editors from a trunk full of hundreds or thousands of fragments.It's not clear whether Pessoa regarded the project as a novel. Nor is it clear whether he regarded any version or part of the project as a finished work. Or in what order he would have presented the work or novel, had he finished it.The sequence in which the fragments have been ordered (presumably, from a selection) is actually a triumph of sympathetic editing.However, I'm not sure whether, if the author intended the work to be a novel, it would have looked anything like what I read.To the extent that its formal concerns might qualify it as a work of Modernist fiction, you have to ask whether they derive from the author or his editors.Textual PersonaeI am nevertheless equally fascinated by the metafictional pretence behind its submission to the reader.The work purports to be the product of the heteronymic author, Bernardo Soares, a figment of Pessoa's imagination.Soares was not just a pseudonym for Pessoa writing as himself. He was a fully-fledged persona, clearly differentiated from Pessoa and many other heteronyms he used to imagine and write other discrete aspects of his work. Thus, the existence of the heteronym allowed Pessoa to fully explore aspects of his imagination, aesthetics and philosophy, without any limitation inferred from its ultimate source in the one person. (Mind you, Pessoa acknowledged that Soares most resembled his true self [\"me minus reason and affectivity\"], to the extent there might only have been one.)The result is that this work is not just fragmentary in its own right. It is the product of a fragmented author.Whether or not it was ever intended to be a novel (by either of its \"authors\"), the work itself (or at least the analysis of it) fits within the concerns of Modernism, if not Post-Modernism (which I maintain is a branch of Modernism, a sub-movement, not a separate movement).Melancholy NihilismThe fragmentation also reflects the philosophical concerns of the author(s).Ultimately, I sense that this is a philosophical work, rather than a fictional work.It's a fragmented, but ultimately comprehensive and systematic, contemplation of the narrator's world and his place in it. The narrator is a thinker, not a man of action. Little happens in the work other than thinking about the self and its relationship with others and the world. It's not quite solipsistic, because the narrator acknowledges the existence of the outside world. However, for him, his own mind is of paramount concern.The editors have assembled the fragments in a thematic way, even though the same themes appear multiple times in the finished text. It could equally have been organised a different way. Or distilled into a short work of melancholy wisdom.The work is a testament to inveterate egoism, miserabilism and misanthropy. Yet, it's been fashioned into a comprehensible philosophy.If sub-headings were added as signposts, it would make a fantastic guide to nihilism or whatever you want to call this particular philosophy. I am reluctant to describe it as Existentialism, because of the apparent lack of Humanism.Whatever you call it, it purports to be a philosophy made by a melancholy person for melancholy people, to the extent that there is any concern for others at all. Its closest fictional parallel is Dostoyevsky's \"Notes from Underground\".Prepossessing AphorismsIt's hard to say how much readers are expected to distance themselves from the ostensible authors or their philosophy. Even if it's serious, it would be ironic if only sad or self-pitying readers related to or enjoyed this work.Its beauty resides in the quality of writing, which can be enjoyed by all readers with a metaphysical bent.Indeed, if all philosophy were conceived and written this lyrically, it wouldn't be the preserve of desk-bound, incomprehensible polysyllabists and LL.B.'s that it seems to have become.This work is as literary and aphoristic as Friedrich Nietzsche, Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw.You can understand and enjoy it, even if you don't agree or sympathise with its underlying philosophy.Ultimately, for this reason alone, it is a creative work, if not necessarily fiction.Still, there is always the possibility that the fiction lies in the creation of a non-fiction work by a fictitious author, narrator or character (as ably assisted by the experts and editors)! It's hard to tell whether the metaphysics is bona fide or purely metafictional.The whole text or philosophy might even be ironic. Who knows? Perhaps Johnny Marr could put it to music!At least this prospect makes it good for a laugh or maybe even a dance. Roger Wilco Foxtrot!\"A Mercator Projection of the Soul\"[An Assemblage of Aphorisms]Below are some aphorisms that map the metaphysical journey of the work:Life and the Abyss:Life would be unbearable if we were truly conscious of it. (212)If there is one thing life gives us, apart from life itself, and for which we must thank the gods, it is the gift of not knowing ourselves: of not knowing ourselves and of not knowing one another. The human soul is an abyss of viscous darkness...no one would love themselves if they really knew themselves...(236)Nihilism and Illusion:In order not to demean ourselves in our own eyes, it is enough that we should become accustomed to harbouring no ambitions, passions, desires, hopes, impulses or feelings of restlessness.(186)Once we believe this world to be merely an illusion and a phantasm, we are then free to consider everything that happens to us as a dream, something that only pretended to because we were asleep.(220)Death and Inaction:I've become a character in a book, a life already dead. Quite against my wishes, what I feel is felt in order for me to write it down.(139)Living seems to me a metaphysical mistake on the part of matter, an oversight on the part of inaction.(114)Looking and Feeling:For me, humanity is one vast decorative motif, existing through one's eyes and ears and through psychological emotion. I demand nothing more from life than to be a spectator of it. I demand nothing more from myself than to be a spectator of life.(198)I am an endlessly sensitive photographic plate. In me every tiny detail is recorded and magnified in order to form part of a whole. I concern myself only with myself. For me the external world is pure sensation. I never forget what I feel.(178)Egoism and Disquiet:That is my morality or my metaphysics or me myself: a passer-by in everything, even in my own soul. I belong to nothing, I desire nothing, I am nothing except an abstract centre of impersonal sensations, a sentient mirror fallen from the wall but still turned to reflect the diversity of the world. I don't care if this makes me happy or unhappy, and I don't much care.(151)The generation to which I belong was born into a world devoid of certainty for anyone possessed of both an intellect and a heart...the world into which we were born had no security to offer us as regards religion, no anchor as regards morality, no stability as regards politics. We were born into a state of anguish, both metaphysical and moral, and of political disquiet.(206)Love and Onanism:We never love anyone. We love only our idea of what someone is like. We love an idea of our own; in short, it is ourselves that we love...The onanist may be an abject creature but in truth he is the logical expression of the lover. He is the only one who neither disguises nor deludes himself.(218)To love is merely to grow tired of being alone: it is therefore both cowardice and a betrayal of ourselves (it is vitally important that we should not love).(240)Futility and Nothingness:The one reason we get on together is that we know nothing about one another.Love disturbs and wearies, action dissipates and disappoints, no one truly knows how to know, and thinking confuses everything. Better then to put a stop to all our desires and hopes, to our futile attempts to explain the world, or to any foolish ambitions to change or govern it. Everything is nothing...(242)Tedium and Worthlessness:Tedium is not a sickness brought on by the boredom of having nothing to do, but the worse sickness of feeling that nothing is worth doing.(91)Tedium is boredom with the world, the malaise of living, the weariness of having lived; in truth, tedium is the feeling in one's flesh of the endless emptiness of things.(122)Silence and Emptiness:I feel this because I feel nothing. I think this because this is all nothing. Nothing, nothing, just part of the night and the silence and of whatever emptiness, negativity and inconstancy I share with them, the space that exists between me and me, a thing mislaid by some god...(262)ADDED EXTRAS:(view spoiler)[[\"Just as Some Music Makes Me Want to Dance,Some Words Make Me Want to Play\"]  (hide spoiler)]Rather than doing updates, the text prompted me to write some mock \"verse\", inspired by either Pessoa's words (in which case I have simply versified them more or less intact) or the tone of his text.I also wrote a story that I placed in comment #1 in the thread.The Semi-Heteronym (Me Minus Reason and Affectivity)As luck would have it,If I was there, so was thisParticular man.Transmitted by ConcupiscenceOnce I wasInnocent,But that wasOnly onceAnd manyYears ago.

The author created an entire world of characters in himself, seeing no journey more important than that of the one into oneself. I have not created my own host of fellow souls, but I am intimately familiar with the ever present malaise, the hesitance toward human interaction, the constant worry over ones reputation with others (strangers on the streets to valued friends to all levels of knowing). Ever present dreaming, ever present distraction, ever present evaluation alongside analysis of the self. Proclaiming the uselessness of everything, yet never making the final step. Dreaming of the novel yet knowing that the novel will never happen so long as the familiar remains itself. Playing mental games to deal with the thinking, the feeling, the hopes and desires suffocated in a soul with myriad reasons for not chasing them.What is the cause of this? What chemical pattern of brain influenced by the combination of genes sinks the self down into introversion, into deep safe waters, always craving yet disdaining yet loving yet loathing the concept and existence of the sun. Who knows.I have not gone as deep as this one here though, and I would have to say that this is better. I don't envy his existence. I see what he has written and can claim multitudes of passages as original thoughts, made by myself upon analysis of our similar existences. There is a quote that says loneliness conveys the sorrow of being alone, while solitude expresses the joy. I look at this book, twenty years of solitude, and I see no solution beyond that of a mindset that I am unwilling to embrace. Falling back on religion is not something I plan on doing anytime soon. Nor will I turn the pain of loneliness into pleasure. I am not so vindictive against humanity as of yet. This book defines a patch of my soul, but I will not let that patch define me; reading this is just another milestone in my path of figuring out my self, and how to allow myself to live as I desire. A wake up call, of sorts. It will be worth rereading if I ever start sinking into this train of thought; it'll definitely be a sign that I need a change, a vacation of sorts.

BachEdited and Translated by Junta1I was born in a time when possibilities were expanding by the day. However, so did the proportion of young people who lost touch with their dignity. It seems the trend will only continue. Visible and invisible disparities.2I love the idea of myself. I am proud, but not vain. I know my defects are too strong for me to love myself as much as the idea of myself.3The idea of living is tedious. One is much more comfortable living inside the mind.4Knowing time only goes forward, towards inevitable death, yet feeling nothing.5As I lie in darkness at night, it seems I am capable of anything. My weaknesses can all be mended tomorrow. All I need to do is open my heart. However, the heart can only be opened in darkness.The exception to this is when there is a ray of light so beautiful and innocent that white meets blue, blue meets pink, pink meets white and the whole world is bathed in every imaginable colour. 6The happiness of a dog, the intelligence of a cat, the curiosity of a mouse. The tremor of a cherry blossom branch, the sophistication of a hydrangea, the humility of a eucalyptus tree. The winds carry our thoughts, the rain washes away our fears, and the sun warms us up from the inside.7Nature is not enough for the modern man. The convict with the death sentence who is as tranquil as if they are already in heaven.8I am still often surprised by my naivet\u00e9. It seems that an extended period of inaction cancels out the fruits of past action.9I have no opinions, and hence exist. It has always puzzled me how people can have so many opinions. Indifference is the first step in living inwardly.10If there was a spider inside of me, its web would be covering my heart. Prey is taken in, but the predator never comes out. It would become prey out of its web. 11I don't like many things, but the things I do I will stick with, like a faithful lady beetle.12Just how alone are we? Just how alone do we want to be?13How rare it is to be attracted to the mind of another. Rarer still for the attraction to be mutual.14I have been awake for a handful of days this year. If my emotions are asleep, I am asleep. 15It is so rare for me to feel profound emotion that I am worried even the most unfortunate of events will fail to move me.16The reliance on thought is, in its shadow, concealing a hypersensitive heart. No, it is not sensitive to many things, but to those that actually deserve our respect and love.17Dreaming is more interesting than anything that can happen in life, or books. The lofty possibilities of each one are combined into rich sensations.18I have never seen a film more exciting than a dream I might have on a lazy afternoon. Unlike the relationship between life and fiction, in which the latter may be more enticing, living inside a dream is much more real than life itself, and much more beautiful than any fiction that, at the end of the day, is not concerned with us. Reading is life's second biggest luxury. It is a shame dreaming is considered a part of life, and not the other way around.19Books. Paper. Trees. Air. Breath. Oxygen. Brain. Mystery. Maze. Serpent. Sword. Hilt. Power. Domination. Prejudice. Colour. Grey. Dullness. Repetition. Habit. Personality. Uniqueness. The meaning of life. ...20Do my chair and desk respect my writing? They have spent too much time with me that they must be apathetic.21Words betray our thoughts. Words are the physical value of gold. Thoughts are its intrinsic beauty. 22Another year of no change. The things you can change are not essential to your own being.23The social meaningfulness of sleeping and dreaming are disproportionately low. 24\"I'm different from everyone.\"\"Oh, me too actually.\"\"That's a coincidence, so am I.\"25Turn this wayThere are so many things I want to talk to you aboutThough I can only meet you in my imagination any more.26One of my fascinations is linking the unlinkable - an acquaintance from ten years ago and a friend I made this year, a kangaroo hopping around Kyoto, philosophising in English with a close friend whom is Japanese. Dreams are where the impossible become possible.27Neither belonging to the mountain, nor the sea.28The frustration at the incongruence between my two tongues. My person lies in the boundary between the two, a boundary that will never be broken down. Growing in one language means leaving the other behind. Since time is not given to catch up, the two are journeying along two paths becoming more divergent by the day.29Dreams are home, life is work, reading is play.30There have been a handful of individuals who I have despised from the first few seconds of meeting. These persons all have one thing in common, and it is ironic that this attribute they share is what I often long for. In reality, it is unattainable.31Were I ever granted a flash of expressive power so great that it concentrated all art in me, I would write a eulogy to chess. A world where thought is action, one's purpose is clear, and art, science and sport all co-exist. One can comprehend the causal chain, and be transported onto a plane where they hold the power to infinite and truth. One only loses because they deserve to lose.32The inability to put effort into anything.33I feel I lost the curiosity for life quite early. My essence lies in a deep sleep in a plain of never-melting snow under the sun from a decade ago, when I realised the incompatibility between my self and the environment. New lands bring new sensations, but the decision to venture forth took too long. I'm not sure how much I lost in those plains. I believe they exist inside myself too, though it will be a long time before the snow there melts.34\"Why did you pull the covers over yourself?\"\"I think it's because I feel cold.\"35Like the attic above my bedroom which I have never ventured to explore (the square opening is as good as forgotten), I am still optimistic about change. It is just that I am pessimistic about how receptive I am to change.36I have always been a great fan of myself. Thoughts are not published or broadcast, but I am always writing the draft....Today I'm an ascetic in my religion of myself. A cup of coffee, a cigarette and my dreams can substitute quite well for the universe and its stars, for work, love, and even beauty and glory. I need virtually no stimulants. I have opium enough in my soul.37Reading is an instance I am open to the world, since I am feeling more than thinking. I do not bother with interpretations, only impressions.38My apathy has also infected my memory, so I am losing my past at an impressive rate. I am used to it, and it does not bother me so much. I am the same old person from year to year, but every moment I am also becoming someone new.39Perhaps in the not-too-distant future, we will be living in our minds, thanks to technology. As much as I live in my mind already, I don't entirely embrace this future. Living in the mind is a voluntary privilege, luxury and virtue that should not be accessible to everyone.40\"What do you want for Christmas?\"\"My fermented thoughts from ten years ago.\"41I have always been fascinated by people who can show their feelings and opinions so openly. The concept of acting, becoming another person is wonderful, but I could not bear other people watching this psychological rendezvous.42An excess of confidence brings more results than a lack of confidence. However, the latter is tragic and beautiful.43Worldly rations of wisdom cannot be consciously acquired after a certain age in youth.44I want to combine the notes of a piano with the lake I often drive past. The smell of the lawn with a passionate discussion over whisky. The translucence of a window with a mental exercise. The taste of sake with the crescent moon. The beauty of prose with the mediocrity of people around me. Whole new worlds will open up when distant planes merge onto one. 45Only relying on intuition on Monday. Principles on Tuesday. Taste on Wednesday. Kindness on Thursday. Indifference on Friday. Perverseness on Saturday. Optimism on Sunday.46I often refrain from speaking something out aloud if most people around could have said the same thing. 47Flawed perfectionism, realistic idealism and melancholy optimism. 48Humanity still seems to be the norm, or people would have killed each other off long ago. It is a blessing to find like-minded people because most of humanity is disagreeable or distasteful.49I have internalised and rationalised everything to such an extent that it's a wonder how most people give me respect for my exterior.50\"Can I be your friend?\"\"Only if you can enjoy this awkward silence with me.\"51\"Today is the first day of the rest of your life.\"\"It will be your last if you keep up with those statements.\"52I am content with the friends I have and the things I enjoy, that the rate of finding new ones is decreasing by the year. Quantity of quality over quality of quantity.53\"Would you rather be remembered as missing in action, or missing inaction?\"54I am amazed at how big religion is in this world.55Each letter of each letter, traversing the seas.56Being strong and not being weak are two entirely different things. It is a question of purpose.57Imagining worlds where psychological conventions, power relations and social structures are completely different from reality. Do you want to make the world a better place, or be the best you can be? Both, or neither?58I do not mind travelling, but they have been a means to an end. I can journey around the whole universe in my mind in the comfort of home. 59Contradictions in personality can either be pitiful, or lovely.60Variegated stupidity.61One sign of loving someone is that with them, you'd want to do things that you would usually detest or avoid at any cost.62I appreciate someone doing something for me a lot more than receiving something materially. I am selfish, and am happy with the rare purchases I make myself. I know what I want and don't want.

This book will forever be synonymous with transition and grief, exploration and longing. I could read only bits at a time, for Pessoa's struggle to understand the world and his place in it mirrored my own and my many gasps of recognition left me breathless. Of course, this is not a book to be read in an orderThe four months it took me to read Fernando Pessoa's posthumously-published collection of thought fragments have been some of the most fraught and chrysalis-splitting days of my adult life. This book will forever be synonymous with transition and grief, exploration and longing. I could read only bits at a time, for Pessoa's struggle to understand the world and his place in it mirrored my own and my many gasps of recognition left me breathless. Of course, this is not a book to be read in an orderly fashion, within a time frame, for a singular purpose. It is meant to be read as it was written, in fragments, unending, one you can pick up at any time, turn to any page, read forwards and back and inside-out. It is a kaleidoscope of dreams and reflections, a rumination on what it means to be a writer, the terrible weight of being human. Of The Book of Disquiet writer Rabih Alameddine says, \"A book tells you quite a bit about its author; a great book tells you quite a bit about you. When I first encountered Disquiet, I felt like laundry \u2014 the book dunked me in pristine water, then battered and wrung me and hung me out to dry in sunshine, rejuvenated. I was forced to examine the choices I'd made, the beliefs I'd held, the loves I'd forsaken and the gods I'd worshipped. Yes. This. Pessoa penned his musings from Lisbon over the course of many years, from WWI to his death in 1935. We are seeing a dark time in the life of a nation, in the life of a solitary man with few friends and family, working at a clerical job which offered little but time to ponder. The melancholic tone woven throughout reflects not only Europe between the wars but a particular 21st century angst, as well. How does one live in the world without being swallowed by it? I found myself longing for the type of solitude Pessoa experienced, those many decades before our lives were invaded by television and the world was cinched tight by the Internet and social media. Detaching from the world is now so very difficult. I'm romanticizing Pessoa's loneliness, to be sure, but what bliss, this silence. I kept a piece of paper tucked inside the book, marking the numbers and opening lines of Fragments that resonated with particular force. Thinking perhaps I'd list them here, in my review. By the end, however, the list had become unwieldy, the fragments too many. But here are a choice few . . . * Fragment 28: A breath of music or of a dream, of something that would make me almost feel, something that would make me not think.* Fragment 48: Solitude devastates me. Company oppresses me.* Fragment 63: I feel like I'm always on the verge of waking up.* Fragment 93: By thinking so much, I become echo and abyss.* Fragment 112: We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It's our own concept\u2014our own selves\u2014that we love.* Fragment 152: To write is to lose myself, yes, but everyone loses himself, because everything gets lost. I, however, lose myself without any joy\u2014not like the river flowing into the sea for which it was secretly born, but like the puddle left on the beach by the high tide, its stranded water never returning to the ocean but merely sinking into the sand. * Fragment 193: I am, in large measure, the selfsame prose I write. I unroll myself in sentences and paragraphs, I punctuate myself. In my arranging and rearranging of images I'm like a child using newspaper to dress up as a king, and in the way I create rhythm with a series of word I'm like a lunatic adorning my hair with dried flowers that are still alive in my dreams. * Fragment 194: A terrible weariness fills the soul of my heart. I feel sad because of whom I never was, and I don't know with what kind of nostalgia I miss him. I fell, with every sunset, against my hopes and certainties.* Fragment 231: One of the soul's great tragedies is to execute a work and then realize, once it's finished, that it's not any good.* Fragment 258: To have touched the feet of Christ is no excuse for mistakes in punctuation. If a man writes well only when he's drunk, then I'll tell him: Get drunk. And if he says that it's bad for his liver, I'll answer: What's your liver? A dead thing that lives while you live, whereas the poems you write live without while.The Book of Disquiet is a particular meditation that were it published today, would come accompanied by trigger warnings for the depressed and anxious. But even in its elegiac angst, there is beauty and comfort to be found. A treasured read I will return to again and again as I struggle to make sense of my life and my place in the world, as Pessoa did nearly a century ago. .", "The Book of Disquiet is less a novel, more the diary of a sensitive and reflective outsider: a dreamer, who compulsively chronicles his contemplations, believing them to be the true manifestation of his soul (ignore the awkward blundering fool who stands before you, these words are the real me!); who lives apart from humanity and imagines a future in which his genius will finally be understood and celebrated...

Is it any wonder this book is so beloved by writers?Much has already been written of the brilliant poetic style, and the trenchant and memorable aphorisms, so I will instead write about what is not so often discussed: though this work is idealised by many, there is much here to be conflicted about. Pessoa (or Soares, if you prefer, though I suspect the name is less an adopted persona than a thin, disinhibiting mask), writes from a position of such inhuman remoteness, that only through a charitable reading of his philosophy may one discover truths that are morally defensible. Surely if one takes seriously his views, for example on political disengagement (one should quietly submit even to unjust rule), on living apart from humanity (\"you are only free if you can withdraw from men\"), life and death (\"death is liberation because to die is to need no one else\"), et cetera - there are a multitude of other examples which I unfortunately cannot provide due to my ineptitude at gathering quotes as I read - surely as incongruous as these views are to non-misanthropes, they cannot be held up as valid moral axioms, and can only be admired in the abstract, on the assumption that they are not opinions sincerely held, but merely a form of poetic expression, which is understood to be romantically overstated, so that in its diminution and its dilution with the banal and the commonplace, some profound ideal may be glimpsed. And there is real value in what can be discovered in The Book of Disquiet, but one must take care not to romanticise Soares's detachment and remoteness, or mistake the actualisation of these as one's aim, for there are better ways to perceive the world.The Book of Disquiet got me thinking about the relationship between suffering and art. While it's true that suffering is not a prerequisite for great art - one must be talented, but is not required to be unhappy in order to pen a great symphony, or create a masterful sculpture - I wonder if the same holds true for great literature, which is so much more a direct expression of the artist's mind, lacking as it does the interstitial abstraction of other artistic mediums. I suppose one cannot make a blanket statement about such things, but I suspect that to write something like The Book of Disquiet, one needs to contain in one's self, more than a just a sliver of Soares. .", "I can only speak of this book in hushed, reverential tones.

Pessoa is best known for writing poetry using \"heteronyms,\" meaning that essentially he had multiple personalities who all were writers. He never intended to publish The Book of Disquiet (or so I've heard); when he died, he left a trunk in his apartment filled with a billion little scraps of paper detailing his observations on everything. Then someone put them in some kind of order and made a stunning book. I think each edition of the book has them in a different order, but get the Exact Change edition, if you're gonna get it. Their books are so gorgeous (I have a whole shelf of only Exact Change books, because any other books put next to them look shabby by comparison), and I'm pretty sure they need your money.

Pessoa is a profoundly introspective and honest writer who defined existential themes based upon his frank study of his own life and dreams: it's possible that Pessoa is the most honest writer who ever lived. He is highly self-critical, self-effacing and suffers from the \"disquiet\" of his simple life as a bookkeeper in Lisbon. He wrote \"B of D\" in that richly germinal literary era in Europe of Proust and Joyce. He composed 481 fragments about the absurdity of life by which he means the inability of man to understand his own existence. \"Each of us is a speck of dust that the wind lifts up and then drops.\"Pessoa's disquieting themes eventually grew into the philosophical worldview claimed by the existentialists but he was an existentialist before many of them. Pessoa writes with the passion of Nietzsche. He is Camus before Camus. He has Kafka's rich sense of the absurd. He experiences daily Sartre's nausea.I devoured every word of \"B of D\" by Pessoa who had the misfortune to remain largely undiscovered and unread until long after his death. His work is existential in the genre of Camus or Sartre (\"I think, therefore, I am a mustache.\") He is dark, at times, but his introspection is oceanic in its breadth, depth and turbulent existential Angst. His writing has been described as \"semi-fiction\" and \"anti-literature\" by his translator. Great writers inevitably challenge the logic of traditional syntax as well as the genres in which they write to transform their genres by the genius of their innovative literary styles which become legacies in themselves.Pessoa writes in fragments which are neither fiction nor poetry but are autobiographical and as such show his disconnect both with life and his own art -- there is no real flow between one fragment and the next like life itself in his existential worldview. He considered his life \"an intermission with band music.\" He also wrote in heteronyms under several noms de plume as if to say he couldn't really even attest to his own single identity as a writer. His fragments are deep, consuming, intellectual dives into his own everyday life. Normally, autobiography is a sign of an immature writer, which Pessoa clearly is not. He writes about his dull job as an accountant among Lisbon's streets and his sightings while smoking at outdoor cafes as well as about thunderstorms, solitude, dreams, the absurdity and futility of life, art, sex, JJ Rousseau and his work. My only criticism of Pessoa comes from his odd observations and poor advice about sex. His translator, Richard Zenith, believes it was possible that Pessoa died a virgin. I make it a practice never ever to take advice on sex from priests, nuns and lifelong virgins.Richard Zenith's translation is truly luminous and he brings rich nuance into the discourse of every line. Like my copy of \"The Recognitions\" by William Gaddis, I have underlined fragments on nearly every page because it is so deeply relevant, honest and compelling in its pure intellectual grandeur. Here are a few favorite passages which stand out for me from \"B of D\":\"Irony is the first sign that our consciousness has become conscious and it passes through two stages: the one represented by Socrates, when he says, \"All I know is that I know nothing' and the other represented by Sanches, when he says, 'I don't even know if I know nothing.'\"\"No one understands anyone else... However much one soul strives to now another, he can know only what is told him by a word -- a shapeless shadow on the ground of his understanding... I love expressions because I know nothing of what they express.\"\"I don't know the meaning of this journey I was forced to make, between one and another night, in the company of the whole universe... We achieve nothing. Life hurls us like a stone, and we sail through the air saying, 'Look at me move.'\"\"The only attitude worthy of a superior man is to persist in an activity he recognizes is useless, to observe a discipline he knows is sterile, and to apply certain norms of philosophical and metaphysical thought that he considers utterly inconsequential.\"\"All life is a dream. No one knows what he's doing, no one knows what he wants, no one knows what he knows. We sleep our lives, eternal children of Destiny. That's why, whenever this sensation rules my thoughts, I feel an enormous tenderness that encompasses the whole of childish humanity, the whole of sleeping society, everyone, everything. It's an immediate humanitarianism, without aims or conclusions, that overwhelms me right now. I feel a tenderness as if I were seeing with the eyes of a god. I see everyone as if moved by the compassion of the world's only conscious being. Poor hapless men, poor hapless humanity! What are they all doing here?\"He worked uselessly every business day for a brute capitalist and recognized by night that his writing was utterly hopelessly, inscrutably and irretrievably futile. The miracle, and the sense of this should not be lost upon you, is that every day he still writes anyway like Van Gogh painting despite making only one sale in his lifetime.I recognized Pessoa instantly from the first few fragments of his life in \"B of D\": I am Pessoa. And he is also you. \"Book of Disquiet\" is life changing. I can't remember ever having been so disappointed to see a book come to an end: it's that good. I implore you to read this immortal literary work of genius by Pessoa. It may be absurd, and even futile, to do so but sometimes the best answer to both is simply to be just as absurd..", "That was the one of the most rewarding and most frustrating reading experience I've had for while.

I also think it is better to dive in and out rather than to read the whole thing as I did it. In any way it is a unique set of texts and a unique experience. I might come back to write more thoughts. But for now, I will leave Pessoa to speak for himself one more time:\"When considered in the light of our inner serenity, we see all those unfortunate chance events in our life - when we were either ridiculous or despicable or appallingly late - as misfortunes that happened on the journey. In this world, we travellers, whether voluntary or involuntary, between nothing and nothing, or between everything and everything, are mere passengers and should not give too much importance to any setbacks experienced en route, to any bumps and bruises suffered along the way. I console myself with that, whether because it does console me or because there is something genuinely consoling about it, I don't know. But that fictions consolation does become real if I don't think about it.And there are so many consolations! There's clear, high, calm sky, across which the occasional imperfect cloud floats by. There's the light breeze that shakes the thickly leaved branches of the trees if you're in the country, and that sets the clothes flapping when they are hung out to dry at fourth or fifth floor windows if you're in the city. There's the heat of hot days and the cool of cool days, and always, in the background, a memory or a nostalgia, or a hope, and someone smiling at the window opening onto the void, and out desires knocking at the door of who we are, like the beggars who are the Christ.\"."], "shelves": ["philosophy", "portuguese-authors", "favorite-books", "best-ever", "read-in-2013", "literature", "classics", "20th-century", "poetry", "classics-literay-fiction", "poetry", "stars-5", "read-2016", "favorites-of-all-times", "portugal", "my-reviews", "favorites", "fiction-in-translation", "best-books-ever", "books-loved-2018", "fiction-20th-century", "favourite-authors", "portugal", "classics", "favorites", "pessoanism", "favorites", "brazilian-portuguese", "biography", "2021", "classics", "e-5-favourites", "g-philosophy", "portugal", "g-poetry", "the-psyche", "europe", "fav-authors", "fiction", "mesmerizing", "global-intrigue", "favorites", "to-re-read", "pessoa", "2013", "spain-portugal", "poetry", "pessoa", "read-2015", "reviews-4-stars", "reviews", "novels", "the-art-of-loathing", "southern-europe", "tortured-artists", "1-read-on-hand", "r-2012", "r-goodreads", "reviewed", "portuguese", "translated", "5-star", "books-are-the-best-invention", "favourites", "6-star", "portuguese", "books-writing-reading", "pessoa", "alter-ego-reviews", "reviewed", "fictional-reviews", "writing-companions", "bio-autobio-memoir", "read-2016", "shorts", "social-political-commentary", "best-of-2016", "literary-fiction", "2016", "philosophy", "dabbling"], "id": 1}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "The Metamorphosis", "author": "Franz Kafka", "avg_rating": 3.84, "review_count": 833199, "url": "/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 2}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "Nausea", "author": "Jean-Paul Sartre", "avg_rating": 3.93, "review_count": 102736, "url": "/book/show/298275.Nausea", "description": "Nausea is the story of Antoine Roquentin, a French writer who is horrified at his own existence.

At the same time, I wish everyone could enjoy Sartre's beautiful writing. Yes, that is beautiful. And not too difficult to understand.A couple of samples:\"Something has happened to me, I can't doubt it any more. It came as an illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like anything evident. It came cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little put out, that's all. Once established it never moved, it stayed quiet, and I was able to persuade myself that nothing was the matter with me, that it was a false alarm. And now, it's blossoming.\"\"When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell a story: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends.\" (So simple and true.) \"If I could keep myself from thinking!

I mustn't think that I don't want to think. Because that's still a thought.\" Will there never be an end to it? My thought is me: that's why I can't stop.

Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance.\" \"You know, it's quite a job starting to love somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment, in the very beginning, when you have to jump across a precipice: if you think about it you don't do it. I know I'll never jump again.\" (NEVER)His words are lethal. And real. And that's a dangerous mix. He shares some thoughts that a lot of people can relate to, and, in most cases, those people won't know what to do with all that. I know I don't. Besides feeling sick, what can you do? Write a book? Eat more ice cream? Go skydiving? Plan a round-the-world trip? Quit your job and live in the country, eating raspberries? Oh, to face the absurdity of the world and to feel free because of that. To stop this never-ending search for meaning. To live. To live? A rare thing, indeed. (Oh dear, I sound like a self-help author.)This was the first time I read Sartre. I've read the brilliant, the one and only, the master at describing the human condition, Dostoevsky; Camus, whose works I really like too; Kierkegaard, the pioneer. So, Sartre was a must-read. Those authors speak right to my soul (wherever that is), they get me (well, not Kierkegaard; at least, not that much. It's complicated. We're cool, though). It's a comforting feeling... being understood by some dead writers you'll never meet, obviously.Yeah.Okay. So, I loved this book. It's a new favorite of mine. And I need some Seinfeld reruns now.Note to self: if you're ever going to re-read this, don't do it while listening to Enya, Craig Armstrong or Joy Division. It wasn't a nice feeling.

He refers to it as Facticity - the nauseated Dread that we who cling to virtue have of hypocrites. But then, afterward, acceptance of all that is ESSENTIAL. Gotta bite the bullet. Smile politely and walk away! What else can we do?The other day, I decided to skim this novel again, after so many years had passed since I read it, and was thunderstruck. Why? Because it describes exactly the same experience I had 50 years ago! It\u2019s an experience which has continued uninterrupted since that time - see my Kindle notes.When I read this book in the 1980\u00b4s I must have ignored its meaning. It was Crazy Sickness. It\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s the Barthian experience of the Alterity of God. Sartre, ever the pessimistic atheist, thought it was the perception of the nothingness of middle-class values. And that\u2019s too bad.T.S. Eliot says some people have the experience and miss the meaning. Many are called but few are chosen. So most folks, perhaps, prize this epiphany in their memory for the rest of their lives but are not fundamentally changed by it. Fred Buechner, though, said we have to SPEAK FROM OUR PAIN...And to see results after such a satori, hard work must follow. And I wrestled with it, as I say, for 50 years. It was a long, cold, hard slog. Until, finally, peace and freedom ensued. But Roquentin - Sartre - just endured its temporary internal pressure for a while, and then continued toward pure futility on his angry, counter cultural way. With great anguish.So it\u2019s a groundbreaking novel about the thunderous, dual irruption of being and facticity into a young man\u2019s life, and for him everything is left in the air for the one who experiences it.You know, it always happens in exactly this way.For at that very moment when we try to seize the prize of Pure Being for ourselves we are necessarily forced to wrestle with a phony world of Being-for-Others - becoming ACTORS in a world we didn\u2019t create.The result is earthshaking for poor, nondescript Roquentin! He, like unlucky Prometheus, has suddenly and shamefacedly stolen Fire from the gods. And a pretty tawdry bunch of gods they\u2019ve turned out to be in his judgemental eyes. But Roquentin grabbed the stick by the Wrong end. You just have to just KEEP GOING - and d*mn the Torpedoes!Once you cross that invisible line in front of your unwary feet, the world falls on its stunned head, and proper orientation is anyone\u2019s guess.Where truth lies now is in unending aporia... a banal flux for Sartre, who had like Nietzsche, transvalued all traditional values, and suddenly:All is changed, changed UTTERLY -A Terrible Beauty is born!A similar thing happened to me when I was a kid. It was pivotal in my development and in my choices as an adult. I had to choose, and fast! It\u2019s like George Santayana said: one day you wake up and realize \u201clife\u2019s not a spectacle - it\u2019s a struggle.\u201dBut for me, it originated from God, I was certain of it. I submitted myself to His Absolute Alterity. Once you\u2019re on that road, there\u2019s no going back. You can\u2019t go home. At least at first...You know, Kafka once wrote a paragraph or two in his notebooks on the Prometheus parable, which describes the anguish that must follow such an experience for us all.He says, that after incalculable aeons, Prometheus, his chains, and the rock he\u2019s chained to in punishment for his sins, all merge into one continuous solid entity.That merging is our return to Wholeness. And the ordinary sensory world - totally divested of extraneous pop gobbledygook - is now \u201cmagnifique, totale et solitaire\u201d.For if we endure the factitious encounter with Becoming patiently, and \u201cin good faith\u201d, one day we will merge with the Rock of Being in peace.It is painfully and near-impossibly difficult. But that is the Path.And it is the Path to our Freedom and Wholeness.One hundred years before Sartre penned this novel, a great Dane suffered the same cataclysmic bifurcation of his being - and, at first, the same unutterable anguish. For him it led to Wholeness too.His name was S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. But - crucially, and in stark contradistinction to Sartre - Kierkegaard found blessed release from it in the end. Sporadically at first, but you can see final freedom was there.You can see his solution in his short masterwork Fear and Trembling...Through a series of subtle and cuttingly double-edged variations on the old, old story of Abraham and Isaac - the original sacrifice - he lays the immovable foundation of Postmodernist Christian Faith. Seen from almost every possible type of viewpoint out of a myriad range of possibilities.And his ineluctable inner logic overpowered all his naysayers.In fact Fear and Trembling paved the way for such modern cutting-edge Christians as Karl Barth and Hans Kung, both the brains trust and the conscientious soul of our new 21st century churches - institutions that seem to the untrained eye to be so out of touch.Perhaps they\u2019re only out of touch to the jaundiced eyes of Big Brother Media. Just try to look at it all a bit deeper! These thinkers are the substance under the New Christians\u2019 (somewhat regrettable) glitter. All that glitters is not gold:You\u2019ve gotta KNOW yourself as well as the World. By dissing the world you\u2019re just digging a bigger hole.And though Sartre somewhat hastily discarded Modern Faith out of hand, we don\u2019t necessarily have to make the same despairing mistake, nor would we have to undergo any more desperate Sartrian anguish, if we chose to do otherwise...and Believe.For the choice we can make, right now, is for Real Inner Peace. The peace of a painfully and patiently stoic Promethean Rock...Which must appear also to be in this ugly world, for so many of us, the Transcendence of a troubled Cross.But that for us is The Only Way, the Only Truth and the Only Life.And that way Works.Roquentin\u2019s doesn\u2019t.We must Accept, and NOT Eternally Reject the Truth..", "(Book 602 from 1001 books) - La Naus\u00e9e = Nausea, Jean-Paul SartreNausea is a philosophical novel by the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, published in 1938.

It is Sartre's first novel and, in his opinion, one of his best works. Antoine Roquentin protagonist of the novel, is a former adventurer who has been living in Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations\u0648 and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his research on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a \"sweetish sickness,\" as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost everything he does or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books, in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a caf\u00e9 owner named Fran\u00e7oise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom\u0648 and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Fran\u00e7oise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: \"I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself.\"He can afford not to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century.Antoine does not think highly of himself: \"The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so.\" When he starts suffering from the Nausea he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: \"My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?\". ...\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646:

Wikipedia calls the novel one of the canonical works of existentialism. (I thought I had read others by Sartre but it turns out they were by Camus \u2013 I have a tendency to mix up those two guys. lol)Nausea is structured as a diary. The main character and the writer of the diary is Antoine Roquentin, apparently an independently wealthy man who spends most of his day in the library researching and writing a biography of an 18th-century international political figure, a (fictional) man named Rollebon. Other than incidental people like librarians and waiters, Antoine interacts only occasionally with two people: a man in the library we know only as \u201cThe Self-Taught Man\u201d and a waitress that he regularly has sex with. We learn nothing about her but the Self-Taught Man is working his way methodically through the library alphabetically by author. Antoine also gives us snippets of caf\u00e9 conversations he overhears.The setting is the fictitious town of Bouville (Mudville) but according to Wiki it is Le Harve where Sartre was living when he wrote this book. The Self-Taught Man, enthusiastic about what he is learning, and the historical figure that Antoine is writing about, act as foils for his philosophical speculations.At times our main character is uncertain why he is writing his book. \u201cIn truth, what am I looking for? I don\u2019t know. For a long time, Rollebon, the man has interested me more than the book to be written. But now, the man\u2026the man begins to bore me. It is the book which attracts me, I feel more and more the need to write \u2013 in the same proportions as I grow old, you might say.\u201dAntoine at times is overcome with\u2026 Despair? Depression? Anomie? Mental illness? Awareness of the absurdity of life? He calls these periods bouts of nausea, although he never has the physical symptoms of nausea.It\u2019s best to let the novel speak for itself: \u201cEverywhere, now, there are objects like this glass of beer on the table there. When I see it, I feel like saying: \u2018Enough.\u2019 \u2026 I have been avoiding looking at this glass of beer for half an hour\u2026I am quietly slipping into the water\u2019s depths toward fear.\u201d\u201cI very much like to pick up chestnuts, old rags and especially papers\u2026.but [suddenly] I was unable. I straightened up, empty-handed. I am no longer free, I can no longer do what I will.\u201d \u201cObjects should not touch because they are not alive. You use them, put them back in place, you live among them: they are useful, nothing more. But they touch me, it is unbearable. I am afraid of being in contact with them as though they were living beasts.\u201d [In a caf\u00e9]: \u201cThere are four or five of them [card players]. I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t the courage to look at them. I have a broken spring. I can move my eyes but not my head. The head is all pliable and elastic, as though it had been simply set on my neck; if I did turn it, it will fall off.\u201d\u201cHis blue shirt stands out joyfully against a chocolate-colored wall. That too brings on the Nausea. The Nausea is not inside me: I feel it out there in the wall, in the suspenders, everywhere around me. It makes itself one with the cafe, I am the one who is within it.\" \u201c \u2018I was just thinking,\u2019 I tell him, laughing, \u2018that here we sit, all of us, eating and drinking to preserve our precious existence and really there is nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.\u2019 \u201d [on trees]: \u201cThey did not want to exist, only they could not help themselves\u2026Tired and old, they kept on existing, against the grain, simply because they were too weak to die, because death could only come to them from the outside\u2026.Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance.\u201d \u201cThese are secretaries, office workers, shopkeepers, people who listen to others in cafes: around forty they feel swollen, with an experience they can\u2019t get rid of. Luckily, they\u2019ve made children on whom they can pass it off. They would like to make us believe that their past is not lost, that their memories are condensed, gently transformed into wisdom. \u2026when all is said and done, they have never understood anything at all.\u201dThere is one other character who appears near the end of the novel. She is Anny, a former lover of Antoine\u2019s, and he says he is still in love with her. She asks him to come to Paris, where she is passing through, to meet with her. (view spoiler)[ When they meet, she tells him she is a \u2019kept woman\u2019 by an old wealthy man. It appears she is only meeting to assure herself that she is no longer in love with him. Well she mustn\u2019t be since she only sees him once and for that short time.  (hide spoiler)]Antoine writes twice that he has not seen Anny for four years and twice that he has not seen her for six years. This makes us worry about the reliability of our narrator.

Going back to my college days, my reading of this work has always been decidedly personal. Thus my observations below and, at points, my own experiences relating to certain passages I have found to contain great power. \"Then the Nausea sized me, I dropped to a seat. I no longer knew where I was; I saw the colors spin slowly around me, I wanted to vomit.\" ---------- The entire novel is written in the form of a diary of one Antoine Roquentin, an unemployed historian living in the small fictional city of Bouville on the northern French coast in 1932. Roquentin's Nausea (his capital) isn't occasional or a revulsion to anything specific, the smell of a certain room or being in the presence of a particular group of people; no, his Nausea is all pervasive: life in all of its various manifestations nauseates him.I recall a time back one muggy afternoon, age eighteen, sitting in a locker room, waiting to take the field for a practice session with the other players on the football team, forced to listen to a coach\u2019s ravings, I suddenly felt repulsed and disgusted by everything and everybody around me. Like Roquentin, I wanted to vomit. When the other players ran out to take the field, I remained seated. Then, calmly walking over to the equipment room, I turned in my uniform and pads. When I walked away I felt as if I shed an ugly layer of skin, a repugnant old self. I felt clearheaded and refreshed; I had a vivid sense of instant transformation. I can imagine Roquentin in a somewhat similar plight but, unfortunately, there's no escape. He's the prisoner of an impossible situation: all of life, every bit of it, gives him his Nausea. \"Nothing happens while you live. The scenery changes, people come in and out, that's all. There are no beginnings. Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable monotonous addition.\" ---------- This was my experience when in my 20s and 30s working in a suffocating insurance office. It didn't matter what time the clock said on the wall - all the hours were a dull, humdrum grey. When I left the office: a great sense of freedom and release.For Roquentin there is no release - all of his small city, every street, park, caf\u00e9, library, parlor and bedroom carries this sense of humdrum dreariness - all times and places have turned dank, shadowy and lackluster as if emitting a soft unending groan. \"It's finished: the crowd is less congested, the hat-raisings less frequent, the shop windows have something less exquisite about them. I am at the end of the Rue Tournebride. Shall I cross and go up the street on the other side? I think I have had enough: I have seen enough pink skulls, thin, distinguished and faded countenances.\" ------ I recall walking in New York City to Penn Station to catch a train at the end of the day. The scene was grim, the vast majority of men and women having a hangdog, beaten down look. I was ready to leave. Roquintin has this feeling not only at the end of the day - he has it all the time. \"I have only my body: a man entirely alone, with his lonely body, cannot indulge in memories; they pass through him. I shouldn't complain: all I wanted was to be free.\" ---------- An entire section of Sartre's Being and Nothingness is devoted to the body. In many ways Roquintin is like Pablo from Sartre's short story The Wall where Pablo feels being in his body is like being tied to an enormous vermin. Ahhh! No wonder Roquintin feels the Nausea.\"He deserves his face for he has never, for one instant, lost an occasion of utilizing his past to the best of his ability; he has stuffed it full, used his experience on women and children, exploited them.\" ---------- Here Roquintin is alluding to an older man who is using his family to make a point displaying how wise he is and how correct his judgements. In this I'm in agreement with the novel's protagonist - I find such people overbearing. I was once in conversation with an older person who actually told me, as a way of discounting my position on a political matter: \"You have to live a little,\" all the while hitting the scotch bottle. Curiously, a few years later, thanks mainly to all the scotch, this know-it-all was in very bad shape. I maintained a noble silence. \"But I would have to push the door open and enter. I didn't dare; I went on. Doors of houses frightened me especially. I was afraid they would open of themselves. I ended by walking in the middle of the street.\" ---------- The narrator's sense of dread and estrangement has reached a point where even objects take on an ominous cast. \"I had thought out this sentence, at first it had been a small part of myself. Now it was inscribed on the paper, it sides against me. I didn't recognize it any more. i couldn't conceive it again. It was there, in front of me; in vain for me to trace some sign of origin. Anyone could have written it.\" ---------- Yet again another example of his extreme alienation - the very words he writes on a page are viewed as something apart, as \"the other,\" having nothing to do with who he really is as a person. \"Now I wanted to laugh. five feet tall! . . . I would have had to lean over or bend my knees. I was no longer surprised that he held up his nose so impetuously: the destiny of these small men is always working itself out a few inches about their head. Admirable power of art. From this shrill-voiced manikin, nothing would pass on to posterity same a threatening face, a superb gesture and the bloodshot eyes of a bull.\" ---------- The portrait captures what Sartre in his philosophy termed \"bad faith\" - assuming false values that have turned him into a \"shrill-voiced manikin.\" \"I jump up: it would be much better if I could only stop thinking. Thoughts are the dullest things. Duller than flesh. They stretch out and there's no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth.\" ---------- The mind is a wonderful servant but an ogre if it becomes one's taskmaster. How many people are trapped in their own thinking, continually reliving painful episodes of their past? Roquintin is one such example in the extreme. \"Things are divorced from their names. They are there, grotesque, headstrong, gigantic and it seems ridiculous to call them seats or say anything at all about them: I am in the midst of things, nameless things.\" ---------- His Nausea has increased. All inanimate objects and situations are encroaching on what he perceives his intellectual and spiritual freedom. Does Nausea sound disturbing? I strongly suspect this is exactly Jean-Paul Sartre's intent. Jean-Paul Sartre, 1905-1980, French philosopher and author of a number of classic works of literature..", "Ogier P. ('the self-taught man') is the symbol of everything that has gone wrong with the socialization process.

This small novel is no doubt an important work and essential reading for philosophical purposes. I remember reading Camus's 'The Stranger and Sartre's Nausea back to back, similar in some ways, not in others, The Stranger lingered for weeks, Nausea drifted away. But for whatever reason, this time around things just clicked. Maybe it helped reading 'The Age of Reason' to finally grasp him, the fact I am a fan of Simone de Beauvoir should mean looking at Sartre in a better light, after all he took her under his wing during her creative days at university. They enjoyed each others company, and this goes to show men and women can become great friends without becoming lovers. Sartre, writer and philosophy professor has certainly embedded himself in literary history, and would say he could have been viewed as the French Kafka by virtue of his gift for expressing the horror of certain intellectual situations, if it weren\u2019t that his ideas, unlike those of the author of \u201cThe Great Wall of China,\u201d were not completely foreign to moral problems. Kafka always questioned the meaning of life. Sartre only questions the fact of existence, which is an order of reality much more immediate than the human and social elaborations of the life that is on this side of life.\u201cNausea,\u201d the journal of Antoine Roquentin, is the novel of absolute solitude, a solitude that made me feel uncomfortable. It is a question here of nothing but the spiritual results of solitude. They are analyzed with a rigor of thought and expression that will no doubt seem intolerable to most readers. Now I see the light, a philosophical novelist of the first order. Since Voltaire, we know that in France the philosophical novel has been a light genre, not far from the fable. Sartre\u2019s literature bears no relation to this frivolous genre, but it gives a very good idea of what a literature associated to an existentialist philosophy might be. The law of the man who is rigorously alone is not the fear of nothingness, but the fear of existence. This discovery takes us far.If his first novel was a work without a solution, by which I mean that it no more opens up any solutions for the universe than the principal works of Dostoevsky, it would perhaps be a singular success without a successor. But with its final pages \u201cNausea\u201d is not a book without a solution. Jean-Paul Sartre who throughout the novel paints a portrait of a great bourgeois city of social caricature, and has gifts as a novelist that are too precise and too cruel not to result in great denunciations, not to completely open up into reality, a reality I would rather not see.A seminal work that I will come to appreciate even more over the space of time..", "We were talking about novels that begin really badly then change gear and turn into great reads.

So ironic and captivating, so funny - there were times I actually laughed out loud. Moreover, Sartre  gets me. I honestly cannot describe the feeling of holding a crummy paperback filled with words written over 50 years ago, and finding one of your own thoughts in amongst those of a fictional character.

I kinda feel I\u2019m not old, educated or wise enough to appreciate it fully, and this is one of those books I would be highly interested to re-read at the different time-periods in my life, to see the effect it has on me over time. Reading Nausea was a unique experience, and definitely, mind-blowing read that left me in awe. At times the Sartre\u2019s writing reminded me of The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge and The Magic Mountain, and I was delighted to find out that Rilke's Notebooks of Malte, one of my favorite books, was one of the main influences for Nausea. Jean-Paul Sartre is painfully honest in character of Roquentin, a lost introverted man in his thirties, tormented by loneliness, anguish, doubt and above all, Nausea, the pain of existing. The book starts with notes in his diary, and in the first few words, we see that he is the real truth seeker, the kind that values truth more than conformity, the kind that would rather suffer and know the truth than live in a lie in the painless state of existing.The best thing would be to write down events from day to day. Keep a diary to see clearly\u2014let none of the nuances or small happenings escape even though they might seem to mean nothing. And above all, classify them. I must tell how I see this table, this street, the people, my packet of tobacco, since those are the things which have changed. I must determine the exact extent and nature of this change.This is what I have to avoid, I must not put in strangeness where there is none. I think that is the big danger in keeping a diary: you exaggerate everything. You continually force the truth because you're always looking for something. We soon learn about his loneliness, and he can\u2019t really find meaning, identity in relation to other human beings, or in contributing to the society, things that regular human being finds shelter and comfort running from their own feelings of meaningless and the absurdity of life.I live alone, entirely alone. I never speak to anyone, never; I receive nothing, I give nothing.I was neither father nor grandfather, not even a husband. I did not have a vote, I hardly paid any taxes: I could not boast of being a taxpayer, an elector, nor even of having the humble right to honour which twenty years of obedience confers on an employee. My existence began to worry me seriously. I don't want any communion of souls, I haven't fallen so low.I particularly liked Sartre\u2019s witty, honest and satirical comments on man-woman romantic relationships, and love and sexuality are underlying themes in the novel, buried under existentialism and absurdism. It can be the defense mechanism of intellectualization and rationalization of love, but I laughed out loud, as well in some other parts of the novel, in admiration that someone verbalized the part of the truth that we all subconsciously know, but refuse to talk or think about. I don't listen to them any more: they annoy me. They're going to sleep together. They know it. Each one knows that the other knows it. But since they are young, chaste and decent, since each one wants to keep his self-respect and that of the other, since love is a great poetic thing which you must not frighten away, several times a week they go to dances and restaurants, offering the spectacle of their ritual, mechanical dances. . .After all, you have to kill time. They are young and well built, they have enough to last them another thirty years. So they're in no hurry, they delay and they are not wrong. Once they have slept together they will have to find something else to veil the enormous absurdity of their existence. Still ... is it absolutely necessary to lie?Odd feelings Roquentin experiences in the nauseated consciousness are nothing more than confrontation with bare existence and nothingness. He displays obvious cynical mockery and even disgust for himself and for the world, but in the same way, under the feeling of emptiness and deep philosophical debates he has with himself, there is profound interest and concern for the fate of the individual person and longing for meaning. His search for meaning is turned within himself, as he attempts to find meaning in his own inner life and experience. In the void of his inner experiences, he loses track of time, space and himself in the processes of derealization and depersonalization in archaic visions. But he learns that neither the experience of the outer world or contemplative deep inner life can\u2019t give meaning to existence. He tries to give life meaning by writing a book, and reviving old passion with his longtime lover, but is faced with ultimate failure each time. Reconciliation is found in the acceptance of contingency and absurd, concepts in which he finally feels liberated but not fulfilled nor happy.And without formulating anything clearly, I understood that I had found the key to Existence, the key to my Nauseas, to my own life. In fact, all that I could grasp beyond that returns to this fundamental absurdity. Absurdity: another word; I struggle against words; down there I touched the thing. But I wanted to fix the absolute character of this absurdity here. A movement, an event in the tiny coloured world of men is only relatively absurd: by relation to the accompanying circumstances.The essential thing is contingency. I mean that one cannot define existence as necessity. To exist is simply to be there; those who exist let themselves be encountered, but you can never deduce anything from them. I believe there are people who have understood this. Only they tried to overcome this contingency by inventing a necessary, causal being. But no necessary being can explain existence: contingency is not a delusion, a probability which can be dissipated; it is the absolute, consequently, the perfect free gift. I am free: there is absolutely no more reason for living, all the ones I have tried have given way and I can't imagine any more of them. I am alone in this white, garden-rimmed street. Alone and free. But this freedom is rather like death. I am bored, that's all. From time to time I yawn so widely that tears roll down my cheek. It is a profound boredom, profound, the profound heart of existence, the very matter I am made of. Expressed absolute boredom and emptiness, and will to sacrifice comfort for freedom reminded me of Madame Bovary, a character that I could heavily relate when I read that books years ago. I could definitely relate to Roquentin, and I think he is a level of epic character, like Dostoevsky characters, that live inside in each one of us. With Nausea, I had a liberating feeling when you read a book for the first time and see someone talk about the parts of you that you never shared with anyone because you thought no one would understand. Even thought Rouqentin had shattering feelings of loneliness in the chaos of existence, I think he made a lot of people like me feel less alone, and I applaud Sartre for that. The more I think about Nause the more I see what a masterpiece of literature it is. Hope to return to this book, and see years from now what are the parts that stuck with me the most, because I\u2019m sure there will be many..", "Jean-Paul Sartre's version of \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and like James Dean, Sartre himself became an icon.

Being without family, friends, or a vocation, his solitary existence gives him plenty of time to reflect on the meaning of his existence. What he finds in answer to his search is only nothingness. He ponders on the actions of humans, including himself, who are ignorant of this real nature of the world, and finds these actions absurd. This absurdity that surrounds him, almost drowning him, makes him nauseous. The plotless story is rather a study of Antoine's thoughts and conducts as he struggles to make a meaningful existence. He finds his whole life in utter disarray. \"For me, there is neither Monday nor Sunday: there are days which pass in disorder, and then, sudden lightning like this one\". The \"sudden lightning\" is the moment of happiness when he feels one with nature, but he cannot help falling into despair again when he deals with the world around him. He doesn't understand why he is here, for what purpose. \"I hadn't the right to exist. I had appeared by chance, I existed like a stone, a plant, or a microbe. My life put out feelers towards small pleasures in every direction\". In his search to find the true meaning of existence, he first discovers that most of the existences are relative. That is to say, most of the existences are formed in relation to some other person, object, concept, or the past. \"I was neither father nor grandfather, not even a husband. I did not have a vote, I hardly paid any taxes: I could not boast of being a taxpayer, an elector, nor even of having the humble right to honour which twenty years of obedience confers on an employee. My existence began to worry me seriously.\" This worry intensifies, Antoine's nausea. He realizes that the task he has set for himself - to write a book on the history of the Marquis de Rollobon - is his way of desperately anchoring his existence to something, even if it's a dead person from the past. Disgusted, he abandons this task and tries another avenue to which he could anchor his existence. He meets his former girlfriend, Anny, and seeks through her to steady his sinking ship. But this effort too is frustrated, and he finds himself drifting further and further into turbulent waters. Antoine feels completely lost. Then, all of a sudden, he is enlightened. \"The true nature of the present revealed itself: it was what exists, and all that was not present did not exist. Not in things, not even in my thoughts.\" Antoine finds that the true existence is what exists at present, at this present moment, divorced from the past. And he also realizes that \"things are divorced from their names\" and that all these things are only \"strange images\" that \"represented a multitude of things\". They are \"not real things\", but \"things which looked like them. Wooden objects which looked like chairs, shoes, other objects which looked like plants.\" Sartre believed that \"existence preceded essence\" and that the \"essence\" or rather the \"characteristics\" of objects are just \"facades\" to hide the unexplainable nature of existence. So, things are only objects, and they exist without us giving them any \"characteristic\". And finally, he understands, what he is. \"And just what is Antoine Roquentin? An abstraction. A pale reflection of myself wavers in my consciousness. Antoine Roquentin...and suddenly the \"I\" pales, pales, and fades out\".With this realization comes the understanding that each of us is responsible for creating a purpose or meaning for ourselves. And for Antoine, there is only one solution to save himself and cure him of his nausea. That is to create an artistic product, not of the past as he tried to do with Marquis de Rollobon, but of the present, and to pour his whole self into it and solidify his existence through it. Existentialists believed that artistic creation is an important aspect of existence. So we can understand why Sartre presented the simple solution of artistic creation as the way of understanding oneself thus curing Antoine Roquentin's nausea. Nausea is a classic existentialist novel. It expounds on the vital aspects of existentialism and paints a good portrait of Sartre's beliefs on existence. It is an important philosophical work and probably one of the best works that explain existentialism. But reading it is quite another matter. It needs a hundred percent of concentration and a good percentage of brainpower to understand what Sartre was driving at. It is not easy to fish out the essentials from the multitude of ideas that Sartre presents in this work. It is a profound work, and I by no means claim to have understood it all. Yet, though it was quite a difficult experience, I'm glad to have read what is considered the fictional masterpiece of Sartre. \" I stand by one thing, which is Nausea. . . . It\u2019s the best of what I\u2019ve done\" This is how Sartre felt of his Nausea. And who are we to contradict the author?.", "The thing with existentialism is that once you admit there's no meaning, you have to admit that there's no meaning, and people get freaked out about it.

Listen, I'll tell you the meaning of life.1) Be nice2) have funThat's it.Neither of those things occur to Antoine Roquentin in this book, so instead he spends 100% of his time freaking right the fuck out. (Sartre felt that we have to create our own meaning, which both is and isn't what I've done here, and his protagonist doesn't get around to it.) The Nausea is what he gets when he thinks about how nothing means anything, which happens often. There are no rules, he thinks. There is no organization. \"Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance,\" he says and by the way here's a super fun game for you single people: pick a quote from this book for your next Bumble date and see if you can say it and still get laid. Here are some more for you.- \"I marvel at these young people: drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories.\"- \"Things are bad! Things are very bad: I have it, the filth, the Nausea.\"- \"'If you look at yourself too long in the mirror, you'll see a monkey.' I must have looked at myself even longer than that; what I see is well below the monkey, on the fringe of the vegetable world, at the level of jellyfish.\"- \"For a moment I wondered if I were not going to love humanity. But, after all, it was their Sunday, not mine.\"- \"We were a heap of living creatures, irritated, embarrassed at ourselves, we hadn't the slightest reason to be there, none of us, each one, confused, vaguely alarmed, felt in the way in relation to the others.\"- \"What if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing?\"That last one might work. Here's another thing Roquentin says: \"I suppose it is out of laziness that the world is the same day after day. Today it seemed to want to change. And then, anything, anything could happen.\" But the thing with this book is that anything doesn't happen, and while I understand that it's sortof the point that nothing happens, that doesn't change the fact that nothing fucking happens, and we have a word for that: the word is boring.I mean - if this is your first existential freakout, you might get more out of it. I feel like maybe this should be read during college, when people get pretty fired up for existential freakouts. If you're already a grown-up, it's frankly too late for this kind of malarkey.

It was a lot more amusing than I had expected.Adventures in Front of a Metaphysical Green ScreenThe novel (started in 1930, published in 1938) needs to be interpreted in the context of:* the philosophy of Husserl (as evaluated by Emmanuel Levinas and read by Sartre between 1930 and 1936), * Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" (published in 1928 and read by Sartre from 1940 to 1941), * Heidegger's \"An Introduction to Metaphysics\" (published in 1935 in the same issue of a journal as an essay of Sartre's), and * the development of Sartre's own philosophy in a number of books up to and including \"Being and Nothingness\" (published in 1943).It's been suggested that the novel reflects the intuitive investigation of various ideas that Sartre would later document more analytically in \"Being and Nothingness\". Iris Murdoch called it \"the instructive overture to Sartre's work.\" If this is correct, then it means that he continued to dwell on these ideas for at least five years before publishing the book that still best defines his existentialist philosophy.While reading the novel, I wondered whether it explored concepts defined by Heidegger in \"Being and Time\". However, it's known that Sartre hadn't read \"Being and Time\" by the time he finished \"Nausea\". It's more likely that the ultimate source of some of these ideas was Husserl, rather than Heidegger.It's still possible that Sartre was familiar with Heidegger because he might have read secondary materials or encountered other people's responses to its initial publication. (Late in the novel, Sartre alludes to the question asked in the first paragraph of Heidegger's \"The Fundamental Question of Metaphysics\": \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\") The Idea (AKA the Thing)I mention Heidegger and Husserl, because the novel purports to be about \"the Idea\" (singular) rather than being a novel of ideas (plural).If I've understood it correctly, the Idea is akin to Heidegger's concepts of Being, Dasein and Existence, precursors of which can be found in Husserl.For the protagonist, Antoine Roquentin, the Idea is like a Thing or, more philosophically, it's like \"Thingness\" or \"Thinginess\". This Thing almost takes on a character of its own and, in doing so, takes on the character of Roquentin in an adversary sense (or so he thinks). Roquentin describes it in terms of an illness or a virus (hence his nauseous response, what he calls his \"sweet disgust\"):\"Something has happened to me: I can't doubt that any more. It came as an illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like anything obvious. It installed itself cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little awkward, and that was all...and now it has started blossoming.\"Up to this point, he has been reasonably self-confident, if not particularly gregarious. Like Sartre himself, he was a man alone. He sets out to understand the Thing, as well as himself in contrast to it:\"I should like to understand myself properly before it is too late.\"Journal of ExistenceRoquentin records his self-analysis in a journal that takes the shape of an intellectual autobiography. This allows Sartre to read Roquentin's mind. Apart from some dynamic set pieces, in which Roquentin reacts to other people and the environment, the novel focuses on Roquentin's internal struggle. It is particularly impressive, if you have a metaphysical bent and are prepared to suspend disbelief.There's a frequent playful or comic undertone to the journal. At times, it reminded me of a 1950's B-movie (\"The Thing from Another World\"), in which the Thing was the alien, the enemy, the bad guy. The Thing seems to embody all that threatens Roquentin philosophically or existentially:\"Things are bad! Things are very bad: I've got it, that filthy thing, the Nausea. And this time it's new: it caught me in a cafe...then the Nausea seized me, I dropped on to the bench, I no longer even knew where I was; I saw the colours slowly spinning around me, I wanted to vomit. And there it is: since then, the Nausea hasn't left me, it holds me in its grip.\"Later, he describes the Thing as a \"big white mass\":\"And the IDEA is there, that big white mass which so disgusted me then.\"\"Now I am alone. Not quite alone. There is still that idea, waiting in front of me. It has rolled itself into a ball, it remains there like a big cat; it explains nothing, it doesn't move, it simply says no. No, I haven't had any adventures.\"A Mere Figment of the ImaginationThe Thing seems to threaten Roquentin's sense of himself:\"My existence was beginning to cause me serious concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?\"Not only was the existence of his self under threat, but so was his past, his memories:\"The true nature of the present revealed itself: it was that which exists, and all that was not present did not exist. The past did not exist. Not at all.\"Still, paradoxically, the self owes its own existence to and forms part of the Thing:\"The thing which was waiting has sounded the alarm, it has pounced upon me, it is slipping into me, I am full of it. - It's nothing: I am the Thing. Existence, liberated, released, surges over me. I exist.\"Roquentin is part of Heidegger's Dasein. Yet, he clings to his sense of self or separate identity. He's not ready to abandon Descartes' subject or cogito, even if he has come to hate mankind and the rest of the world:\"My thought is me: that is why I can't stop. I exist by what I think...and I can't prevent myself from thinking. At this very moment - this is terrible - if I exist, it is because I hate existing. It is I, it is I who pull myself from the nothingness to which I aspire: hatred and disgust for existence are just so many ways of making me exist, of thrusting me into existence. Thoughts are born behind me with a feeling of giddiness, I can feel them being born behind my head...If I give way, they'll come here in front, between my eyes - and I go on giving way, the thought grows and grows and here it is, huge, filling me completely and renewing my existence.\" Roquentin remains indebted to Descartes, while trying to embrace aspects of Heidegger's philosophy:\"I am, I exist, I think therefore I am; I am because I think that I don't want to be...I exist because that is my right. I have the right to exist, therefore I have the right not to think...\"...therefore, I have the right not to exist...\u201cThe Thing, C\u2019est Moi\u201dRoquentin's consciousness has stumbled into some form of nihilism or absurdity, while trying to reconcile with the Thing and Nausea.\"I was just thinking that here we are, all of us, eating and drinking to preserve our precious existence, and that there's nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.\"\"Objects are not made to be touched. It is much better to slip between them, avoiding them as much as possible. Sometimes you take one of them in your hand and you are obliged to drop it as quickly as possible...so this is Nausea...Now I know: I exist - the world exists - and I know that the world exists. That's all. But I don't care. It's strange that I should care so little about everything: it frightens me. It's since that day when I wanted to play ducks and drakes. I was going to throw that pebble, I looked at it and that was when it all began: I felt that it existed.\"\"I am in the midst of Things, which cannot be given names. Alone, wordless, defenceless, they surround me, under me, behind me, above me. They demand nothing, they don't impose themselves, they are there...I push open a gate, I go through, airy existences leap about and perch on the treetops...I should so like to let myself go, to forget, to sleep. But I can't, I'm suffocating: existence is penetrating me all over, through the eyes, through the nose, through the mouth...And suddenly, all at once, the veil is torn away, I have understood, I have seen.\"\"The Nausea hasn't left me and I don't believe it will leave me for quite a while; but I am no longer putting up with it, it is no longer an illness or a passing fit: it is me.\"The Thing has won, it has conquered Roquentin, as it has all other existents. Dare I say, it becomes him.The Very Stuff of ThingsRoquentin has realised that the Thing is actually something, rather than nothing (even if he doesn't know why):\"If anybody had asked me what existence was, I should have replied in good faith that it was nothing, just an empty form which added itself to external things, without changing anything in their nature. And then, all of a sudden, there it was, as clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost its harmless appearance as an abstract category: it was the very stuff of things, that root was steeped in existence. Or rather the root, the park gates, the bench, the sparse grass on the lawn, all that had vanished; the diversity of things, their individuality, was only an appearance, a veneer. This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous masses, in disorder - naked, with a frightening, obscene nakedness.\"A Heap of ExistentsThe epigraph to the novel is a quote from Celine:\"He is a fellow without any collective significance, barely an individual.\"This might well describe the nihilist Roquentin. He was neither complete as an individual, nor did he form part of his community.So Roquentin investigates the social and political relationship between individuals, only to find that, knowingly or not, all people are affected by the existence of the Thing:\"We were a heap of existents inconvenienced, embarrassed by ourselves, we hadn't the slightest reason for being there, any of us, each existent, embarrassed, vaguely ill at ease, felt superfluous in relation to the others. Superfluous: was that the only connexion I could establish between those trees, those gates, those pebbles?...Each of them escaped from the relationship in which I tried to enclose it, isolated itself, overflowed. I was aware of the arbitrary nature of these relationships, which I insisted on maintaining in order to delay the collapse of the human world of measures, of quantities, of bearings; they no longer had any grip on things. Superfluous...And I - weak, languid, obscene, digesting, tossing about dismal thoughts - I too was superfluous...I was superfluous for all time...The word Absurdity is now born beneath my pen; a little while ago, in the park, I didn't find it, but then I wasn't looking for it either, I didn't need it; I was thinking without words, about things, with things...Without formulating anything clearly, I understood that I had found the key to Existence, the key to my Nausea, to my own life. In fact, all that I was able to grasp afterwards comes down to this fundamental absurdity...But I should like to establish the absolute character of this absurdity...I, a little while ago, experienced the absolute: the absolute or the absurd.\"What differs between people is the level of recognition of the absurd.The Contingency of ExistenceNausea is the recognition that humanity, the world and life are merely contingent, that they are superfluous, that they are not meant to exist, that there is no reason for them to exist.\"The essential thing is contingency. I mean that, by definition, existence is not necessity. To exist is simply to be there; what exists appears, lets itself be encountered, but you can never deduce it...contingency is not an illusion, an appearance which can be dissipated; it is absolute, and consequently perfect gratuitousness. Everything is gratuitous, that park, this town, and myself. When you realise that, it turns your stomach over and everything starts floating about...; that is the Nausea.\"\"I was all consciousness of its existence. Still detached from it - since I was conscious of it - and yet lost in it, nothing but it...Existence is not something which allows itself to be thought of from a distance; it has to invade you suddenly, pounce upon you, weigh heavily on your heart like a huge motionless animal - or else there is nothing left at all.\"\"Existence everywhere, to infinity, superfluous, always and everywhere; existence - which is never limited by anything but existence...existence is a repletion which man can never abandon.\"\"I was not surprised, I knew perfectly well that it was the World, the World in all its nakedness which was suddenly revealing itself, and I choked with fury at that huge absurd being. You couldn't even wonder where it all came from, or how it was that a world should exist rather than nothing. It didn't make sense, the world was present everywhere, in front, behind. There had been nothing before it. Nothing. There had been no moment at which it might not have existed. It was that which irritated me; naturally there was no reason for it to exist...But it was not possible for it not to exist. That was unthinkable: in order to imagine nothingness, you had to be there already, right in the world, with your eyes wide open and alive; nothingness was just an idea in my head, an existing idea floating in that immensity; this nothingness hadn't come before existence, it was an existence like any other and one which had appeared after a great many others.\"The Pale ConsciousnessIt's interesting to think of Sartre's fictionalisation of Roquentin's internal life as if he is actually no more than a creature of fiction. This passage is even more pregnant with meaning, when you imagine or recognise its metafictional connotations:\"Antoine Roquentin exists for Nobody. That amuses me. And exactly what is Antoine Roquentin? An abstraction. A pale little memory of myself wavers in my consciousness. Antoine Roquentin...And suddenly the I pales, pales and finally goes out...Lucid, motionless, empty, the consciousness is situated between the walls; it perpetuates itself. Nobody inhabits it any more. A little while ago somebody still said me, said my consciousness. Who?...The consciousness exists like a tree, like a blade of grass. It dozes, it feels bored. Little ephemeral existences populate it like birds in branches. Populate it and disappear. Forgotten consciousness, forsaken between these walls, under the grey sky... And this is the meaning of its existence: it is that it is a consciousness of being superfluous. It dilutes itself, it scatters itself, it tries to lose itself on the brown wall, up the lamp-post, or over there in the evening mist. But it never forgets itself; it is a consciousness of being a consciousness which forgets itself. That is its lot.\"Perhaps a character in a novel exists only temporarily and contingently in the mind of a reader. We readers mess with the minds of literary characters. We are the characters' Thing.If you want to read the definitive novel about the Thing, make sure it's this one! It's a comic stripped bare by existentialists.

Perhaps I also thought I should ease my way gently back into fiction with something written by a philosopher. The more I think about it, the more this book seems like an awfully strange one to pick \u2013 but I seemed quite determined at the time to start reading it.

It would be nice to then be able to say \u2013 and this was just the book I needed to read right now, this was just the thing - as if there were some guiding principle to the universe directing our hands and demanding we read things in their proper order, at their proper time. But I can't say that.The characters in this book that are the most interesting (and I\u2019m going to use the word \u2018character\u2019 very loosely here) aren\u2019t necessarily the ones you might think they are going to be when you start. I mean, obviously enough the narrator has to be important here \u2013 we are in his head so everything we see is filtered through that. But I came away thinking that the Self-Taugh Man is probably the most important character other than the narrator. The character you might think ought to be more important than anyone here would be Anny \u2013 but although there are lots of lovely passages about her, I didn\u2019t find them coming together as nearly as interesting as I had hoped they might. The hand holding in the cinema, an hour before his train leaves at one point, was really a delight to read, but the conversation in Paris I found harder to really believe. The other really interesting characters aren\u2019t really characters at all \u2013 they are the nausea and existence. For Sartre our being proceeds our essence. That is, you don\u2019t really have an eternal essence, as such, despite our brains perhaps being composed to imagine we do \u2013 but rather we are what we become - so we don't 'remain' but rather change and this is what is fundamentally true about us. Quite a few times we hear that characters are relied upon to remain the same - but this is never to be trusted, I think. This idea of us becoming and changing presents us with lots of paradoxes and none of these are necessarily all that easy to explain. A lot of this is about the main character, Roquentin, seeking to understand his own essence, I think. He is writing a history, but isn\u2019t entirely sure why he is. And he is worried \u2013 not least because he is starting to think of himself that he is a bit more flighty than he would like to consider himself to be. Also, and I think this is very important, he basically thinks of himself as a vegetable \u2013 yeah, I know, you weren\u2019t expecting that, were you? The introduction to this book makes a lot of his interaction with a chestnut tree at one point during the novel \u2013 but I think this is mostly interesting because of his identification with vegetation that occurs throughout the book. The idea of him vegetating (I\u2019ve no idea if that works in French, by the way, but it echoed throughout the book for me anyway) kept recurring. And when he is with the chestnut tree he basically isn\u2019t with the tree at all, but rather he says he is the chestnut tree. Well, except he identifies more with the roots of the tree than with the tree itself \u2013 stuck in the ground, hard and black. That sense of dark and of being trapped and of vegetating \u2013 it could easily be badly overdone (over-written), but it didn\u2019t feel overdone here at all. I thought it was quite clever, to be honest. And then, after he leaves the chestnut tree and after he has fully identified with it, that is when (surprise, surprise) he decides to leave Bouville and go to Paris - to change his life and therefore to be someone else. Here the psychology is particularly interesting \u2013 that he was trapped and vegetating until he identified with something rooted to the ground and it was only then that he could see a way out, a way to move.The nausea is interesting too \u2013 this really is a character in the book in so many ways. A recurring illness that we can never tell is physical, but one that seems to be a force that makes him move, that occurs when his life is set to change. I liked this book much more than I thought I was going to. Again, if I didn\u2019t think I was going to enjoy it, why the hell did I read it? But it was interesting in so many ways. The story of the Self-Taught Man is the most interesting piece here \u2013 and much more interesting today, I suspect, than when it was written. We have become obsessed with paedophilia \u2013 it is our new blasphemy. Part of the reason I avoid films is because I'm sick to death of characters (often priests) who have a horrible secret... So, the idea that Roquentin stands up for the Self-Taught Man \u2013 especially after despising him for being a humanist \u2013 is really interesting. The other people are presented, and as they are, as simply bullies. Look, the idea of someone sexually assaulting children is repulsive in the extreme, I get it \u2013 but self-righteousness and violent attacks on people who are essentially defenceless are two things I find at least equally repulsive. I would like to think I would have done much as what Roquentin did here in the library, but I worry I may not have ever had the courage.Like I said, this proved to be a much more interesting book than I thought it was going to be \u2013 you know, given the title - not quite 'vomit' but close enough. I\u2019ve read some of Sartre\u2019s short stories before and thought they were a bit daft, to be honest \u2013 too keen to make a philosophical point and so, better to have been written as philosophy than as fiction \u2013 but I thought this was clever and understated and a good read generally..", "\u201cPeople.

He attempts to find solace in oth\u200cers, but while interacting with them, they evoke a sense of nausea in him. Due to his aloofness to the world and the people, he eventually doubts his existence.Sartre beautifully explains his philosophy through the mundane life of his protagonist, who is annoyed by people of bad faith: unauthentic people living with fake emotions and cliche thoughts. The only things that save him from nausea are Jazz and memories of a woman he loved in the past. Finally, after a painful journey, he realizes there is no meaning for his existence unless he defines himself by his values and goals. He finds this in literature and hopes that writing will give meaning to his meaningless existence.Nausea grants consciousness remarkable independence and gives reality the full weight of its sense. \"Suffering is the origin of consciousness,\" Dostoevsky once wrote. Sartre, in his novel, is showing that life begins on the other side of despair. While listening to Jazz, the protagonist notices the pain in music, saying, \u201cYou must be like me; you must suffer in rhythm.\u201d That made me wonder, maybe that is what jazz tries to tell: suffer in rhythmic ups and downs of life.In my opinion, the book was an uneasy marriage of philosophy of existentialist and literature. You can see Sartre's beliefs almost everywhere: man is condemned to be free; existence precedes essence. Haunted and sinking by the great and deep loneliness, I found the book a great companion in which many lines were accurate descriptions of my feelings. From middle school to high school, I was in my philosophical journey and had been through the fears and doubts that the protagonist experienced. After graduation, I have found answers to my questions and dedicated myself to my meaning. I think the story is relatable for those who are going or have gone through a philosophical journey of their inner selves. The aloofness, nausea, and loneliness are still within me and become more obstinate. They grow inside and devour me like a parasite, nausea. I feel so distant, abandoned, and estranged that I can hardly feel my existence, and I found consolation in this book.\u201cI want to leave, to go somewhere where I should be really in my place, where I would fit in . . . but my place is nowhere; I am unwanted.\u201d\u2015 Jean-Paul Sartre, Nausea.", "\u2b50\ufe0f small dick energy star As a French person, when foreigners learn that I 'majored' in Philosophy in HS, the first name that burst out of their mouth is, you guessed it, Jean-Paul Sartre.

Since he feels emasculated, he also feels the need to share his sexual adventures even if it doesn't bring anything to the story. I thought Nausea might change my opinion on this dude, it really didn't. He's still as snobbish, naggy and unconvincing as I remember, if not more. This is, I believe, my fourth JPS without counting the numerous plays I've seen, and it's probably his most outrageous work.  What astounds me is that Nausea is one of his most read book abroad, for some reason. I need help to understand why. It's really not good. The character is another reflection of Sartre, it seems that he can't help but write books about himself... Sartre really had an ego problem that is definitely blatant in this excuse of a book. He likes to hear himself talk even if there's nothing bright about what he's saying =O.G small dick energy. The plot, was there even one? I wouldn't know, I haven't found it and I'm really not Nancy Drew so I'm gonna bother. This book is a succession of emptiness and unsubstantial dialogues after another.  Sartre's writing is unfocused and drafty, unable to reach the so-called paradigm of intellect he represents. He's walking in a circle, unable to form coherent thoughts and come to an intellectual conclusion. This book could have easily been 5 pages long essay instead of a 25O pages long babble of nothing. We have pages and pages of dialogues between two people sitting in a caf\u00e9 our MC doesn't even know. It makes me wonder if he was paid by the page... It pains me to know that this is what France is known for when we have much more talented and intelligent thinkers. Nausea is a snob, boring and unintelligent 'book' I don't recommend to anyone.

Sartre is a talented writer, capable of some truly striking prose, and the novel succeeds at drawing the reader deep into the mind of Roquentin in a manner that is intimate and engaging. But I can't say that I find these ideas as a basis for thought all that compelling. Sartre seems to have seized upon a common yet admittedly powerful experience - that peculiar sensation of sudden strangeness which can impose itself on otherwise familiar objects and concepts, accompanied by the simple striking fact of existence without explanation - and imbued this experiential phenomenon itself with a special profundity, from which he has extrapolated an entire philosophy. There is a logical failure in privileging such experiences due to their ephemeral yet strikingly salient quality, as being somehow representative of a deeper truth than can be obtained through ordinary rational thought. Such a thing would necessitate the existence of a sort of mind/brain dualism, where the mind thorough some undefined (and undemonstrated) metaphysical ability may occasionally transcend itself, and be allowed to glimpse the hidden nature of reality. I compare this kind of thinking to the practitioner of transcendental meditation, or the avid taker of psychedelics, who has experienced a profound oneness with everything, and is therefore convinced that all things in the universe must in fact share a single consciousness.The fact is that the brain is a strange and complex organ, prone to weirdness, and possessing a propensity for illusion and occasional quirky states of mind. Often these experiences can be generated deliberately through certain practices or through the use of pharmaceuticals. And so while such phenomena can offer valuable new perspectives, any revelations are necessarily limited to the nature of experience itself; they cannot break through the barrier of the mind to expose hidden knowledge about external reality.The attitude, then, of the Existentialist (in this case Roquentin), becomes increasingly myopic as this special information is granted primacy at the expense of other equally (and arguably more) valid experiential data. His mind obsessively explores the repercussions of this extrapolation from the single, logically unsound point, and it is clear to the reader that this view of reality is simply not tenable with respect to ordinary experience. I personally cannot claim any great familiarity with existentialism in the wider sense, but the ideas presented in Nausea, aside from offering some interesting fodder for contemplation, seem too abstract and dissociated from reality to form the basis of a particularly robust or productive philosophical system..", "Deeply unsettling novel reflecting the hideous emptiness of our existence. \"I want to leave, to go somewhere where I should be really in my place, where I would fit in . . . but my place is nowhere; I am unwanted.\u201d Deeply unsettling novel reflecting the hideous emptiness of our existence. \"I want to leave, to go somewhere where I should be really in my place, where I would fit in . . . but my place is nowhere; I am unwanted.\u201d .", "I have to admit that I read this book in the summer between finishing high school and starting college - a time when I felt sure everything I'd been taught was irrelevant.

Nausea seems to me an apologue on existence. We do exist, according to the man, which providentially, offered me some temporary consolation. Otherwise, why shower tonight?Sometimes we use others, without realizing it, to affirm our existence. Example: \u201cWhy did you throw a hot pancake at my face?\" \"To confirm your existence, silly.\u201dRoquentin, his narrator, notices, while endeavoring to research another man for a book he is to write, that \u2018existence precedes essence.\u2019 Makes sense.

HoweveAmid my own existential crisis, I picked up 'Nausea', hoping to find something I could resonate with. The novel explores the philosophy of existentialism, which states that an individual is a free agent entirely responsible for his actions in a world that has no meaning.The book is about Antoine Roquentin, a historian who spends his time researching a well-known political figure, Rollebon. He is fascinated by the man and digs into his life to gather information and write a book about him. However, Antoine feels like a stranger in his body and disconnected from reality.The novel is his contemplation of existence. Sartre puts forward the idea that 'existence precedes essence. While giving an example of a Chestnut tree, Antoine says that the characteristics such as shape or size do not define it. Instead, it's a facade created by humans to hide its existence because they are fearful of confronting it. The feelings of Nausea hit him when he realizes he is attributing essence to the objects he sees.He believes that as humans are fundamentally free to do whatever they wanted, freedom comes with responsibility for their actions. And this causes people to deny that freedom. Furthermore, Antoine abandons his research on Rollebon, realizing he has been using him to justify his existence. Sartre presents art as a solution to combat the meaninglessness of existence.I can't help but compare the 'Nausea' to 'The Stranger' I read a while ago. Both novels are an exploration of the concept of existentialism. In fact, Sartre and Camus were friends but had a falling out because of the difference of opinions.Antoine is trying to understand and justify his existence, and in the end, he embraces the idea that existence is meaningless. Whereas, Mersault from 'The Stranger' is emotionally detached from the world around him. He believes in the irrationality of the world; hence he's indifferent to the concept of morality. It contrasts with the conventional wisdom of society; consequently, he is condemned because of it.Antoine realizes that he is free but there's no value in this freedom because of the world's randomness. Moreover, because he believes release comes with responsibilities, he chooses not to give meaning to his existence because it's a burden to him.Because of this, he believes people act in bad faith. In philosophical terms, it's the psychological phenomenon whereby individuals act inauthentically by yielding to the external pressures of society to adopt false values and disown their innate freedom as sentient human beings. He links existence to bad faith.In Mersault's case, he just accepts the reality of the situation as he attaches no importance to life and death; for him, it's the same thing. In my opinion, 'The Stranger' is much more straightforward with the philosophy it's trying to depict and ends on a positive note.To sum up my opinion on this novel, it was a struggle to get through the tedious narration of the protagonist. However, if you're willing to put your time and effort into understanding the philosophy, you should read this book.Bookstagram.", "Back in my school, when I took \u201cSanskrit\u201d for the first time as a language, I was fascinated by it.

Like Mathematics, I felt that anything and everything could be explained by Sanskrit. The language of the wise and experienced, it had its roots dating back to millions of centuries and was contributed to swell to its current form by thousands of brilliant minds and astute practitioners of life and non-life forms. The stream was so vivacious and bountiful that by just touching its surface, i.e., by just getting to learn the language\u2019s basics, my senses were acutely turned on. I was into my first few classes, when I came across the word, \u201cAham\u201d, which meant \u201cI\u201d. While the basics of I, You, We, Them, etc. were diligently thought to us, like any other language learning mandates, there was always something palpably unique about \u201cI\u201d. The moment I uttered the syllable, it empowered me; it centralized control into my being and elevated me right to a pedestal from where I could do as I wanted do. Or so, I felt. But is being one\u2019s self and living in that \u201cI\u201d cosmos so easy? And at what cost? With what options? And is it even possible?Nausea is my first brush with the philosophy of \u201cExistentialism\u201d. For the uninitiated like me, this is the concept of putting the I in the middle of the universe and seeing and reasoning everything through his perspective. If he doesn\u2019t see something, it doesn\u2019t exist. If his dreams are walking, the dreams exist. If his memory fails, the memories don\u2019t exist. If he can touch his pain, the pain exists. This branch of philosophy grants supreme status to the individual; in fact, the individual is the only legitimate student of this school of thought.My first book (and first reading) on the philosophy of \u201cExistentialism\u201d was, err, erratic! There was so much happening and yet, so little was happening. It was like a whole chapter of fifty pages have been written and the pen had not moved from the first word, in essence that is. I read this book twice, just to get a little grasp over it. I might have failed miserably though.\u201cA crowd is untruth.\u201d This simple statement of Soren Kierkegaard is like that bottomless bit into which one can contract a free fall forever and never reach the destination. And Sartre, made this pit a bit more hostile when he said, \u201clife begins on the other side of despair.\u201dNausea is a collection of diary entries of Antoine Roquentin, a writer, who is trying to piece together an article during his stay at Bouville. For the outsider, he is a fairly well-placed guy, staying in a hotel, visiting cafes for drinks, spending time at libraries, moving between smaller junctions on foot and train and picking up random conversations without a hiccup. But for Roquentin, its nothing but a pungent fa\u00e7ade. He is lonely and devoid of friends. He has had a failed love affair which he is unable to forget. He is here for a specific assignment whose foundation even, is eluding him. For him, all the \u201csociety-approved\u201d activities, that the outsider finds meritorious and gay, are no more that solid, cotton balls, drifting in air aplenty, obliterating his views by colluding his concentration and squashing his sanity.He is searching in vain for a meaning of his being, to attach a gravitas to his floating body and imbecile mind but he mostly bites the dust. His continuous failed trysts with truth and purpose turns him into a walking wall of disgust and scorn, whose venomous bricks start infecting each other and rendering its whole structure, slowly, invalid. His nausea follows him everywhere and unleashes its vomit at all paces, without mercy. So, he sees a well-synchronized, melodious jazz piece as nothing more than a bunch of forced notes, destined to born and die in quick play. Their existence, terminated. He views a face on a poster as aligned to the words on the poster only till the time someone tears the poster apart. The duo\u2019s existence, terminated. In his eyes, the pleasant mast of a Sunday morning is alive only till it is forcefully gulped down by the Sunday Evening (which is more faithful to a busy Monday Morning). The Morning\u2019s existence, terminated. He is overcome by rage at the sight of something as trivial as cold meat but doesn\u2019t feel a drop of water between his eyelids at the sight of an utterly detached beloved. He surprises himself with his scribbling, which on touching the diary, at once, turns alien. He rambles with his dreams, his musings and his world for long. And at long last, he sees the blinding truth at the feet of a chestnut tree. Its root, kneaded into existence. The existence of the leaves, the branches, the bark, the root were abstract and not relative. Each of them, in their own way, would chart out a course: the leaves sprouting out, ripening, falling and kissing the earth; the branches extending, withering and regrouping into ashes; the bark, growing, plateauing and stunting into sterility and the roots, encroaching, entangling, sucking and falling into quietude in some other field. They would not enclose each other, although, they would coherently look a part of the bigger picture.Roquentin, suddenly, realized that although shaping the walls of existence was primarily an individual exercise, a mission of a perennial kind, it can be erected by the help of friends, and memories. None of the friends or memories form the existence but they can act as a preface to an effective existence. Nothing is meaningless; yes, even the nausea, as long as it leaves between its spell, a meaningful existence, a vehicle on which an individual can mount and successfully cross another bout of nausea.For a novice like me, it was an immensely intense read, and an engaging one too. I read in a few articles that Sartre, although credited for his huge contribution to Existentialism, was not credited much for his narrative skills. I don\u2019t know how much of it is true but I thoroughly enjoyed his simple yet vivid language. His attention to detail was captivating. Sample this:When Roquentin is witnessing a game of cards: \u201cThe cards fall on the woollen cloth, spinning. The hands with ringed fingers come and pick them up, scratching the cloth with their nails.\u201dAnd when Roquentin is lying in bed at night and a window by his bedside is open: \"Calm. Calm. I can no longer feel the slipping, the rustling of time. I see pictures on the ceilings. First rings of light, then crosses. They flutter. And now another picture is forming, at the bottom of my eyes this time.\u201dMy mind needs to dwell a little more on this neo-concept of Existentialism.

The protagonist establishes an inner dialogue with himself and engages the reader in an acerbic and self-mocking dialogue in which he reasserts his individual freethinking over the redemptive control imposed by totalitarian principles.But as juicy as Pevear\u2019s references and footnotes were, the cavernous voice that crawled from the netherworld and seeped into my conscience seemed atemporal and devoid of indoctrinating intention to me, and therefore, universal. \u201cI'm now asking an idle question of my own: which is better--cheap happiness, or lofty suffering? Well, which is better?\u201dI listened to a man\u2019s introspective self-judgement, to the confession of a life dragged away by the currents of his deficiencies, his frustrations, his shame and infectious regrets that fester in the wound of his current existence.Dostoevsky\u2019s man from the underground is the embodiment of a decisive juncture that every human being will face at some point in his life: the crossroads between ignoble actions taken in the heat of the moment and virtuous resolves that never materialized, the split second when the mask of self-deception is dropped and lofty pride and steely detachment dissolve into smothering sadness and remorseful loneliness. I listened and nodded in recognition.\u201cI am alone, I thought, and they are everybody.\u201d The hypocrisy of denouncing the perversity of the Western civilization, this \u201ccrystal palace\u201d of rationality and hollow idealism and its despicable inhabitants, and the irrepressible craving to belong to it, to be accepted and praised by those who were adamantly ridiculized in order to cover one\u2019s own failures and corroding envy.The acrimonious humor and spiteful demeanor, mere rudimentary shields to conceal the resigned acquiescence to one\u2019s insignificance and disguise the fear of losing with affected indifference.Does it ring a bell? Yes, I know.\u201cTo love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise.\u201dDesire makes the man from the underground vulnerable.Feigned hate, rocambolesque plans for revenge and mean-spirited humiliation become necessary tools to banish those who might offer unselfish love and the burden of happiness.I listened to the cacophony of the paradoxical selves that give voice to this conflicted narrator who speaks from the underworld, from the fetid gutter in the obscure basement of mankind\u2019s subconscious, and I joined him in polyphonic canon.For this cantankerous misfit exposes the turpitudes of our human souls without reservation, sometimes with his head, others with his heart but mostly with a gut instinct that bleeds with the raw honesty only the unrepentant liar possesses. There is no light that allows us to discern a clear image of the creature that inhabits the catacombs of our consciences but the man from the underground has learned to see in the dark. His voice comes from beyond. You just need to close your eyes and listen..", "I am writing this review because I have just finished and writing is the only thing I can do at this moment.

The book has shaken me where reading any other book in the future has come into question. Maybe I should have waited till the heat simmered and collected my thoughts but this too would counter what I have just read, experienced and been shaken by. Let's start with the simple and easy and get it out of the way. The book is told in first person by a narrator who was not raised by parents or in a loving family. He has isolated himself, except for his man servant-also his greatest tormentor-from others, from what we call life. He lives off of little. This now being out of the way, the book starts with an unreliable narrator who goes through a world's breadth of feelings about himself. This is extreme. It is savage. This book is savage and meant to be. If you have a ,Savage, shelf this is the book to shelve there but alone, apart from others. On one level the story is about a man who was not loved, is not capable of love, friendship, and has shut himself away metaphorically underground. Who better to see the world through? These are not the eyes of an unreliable narrator. We are all to some degree unreliable narrators. I am. He is not. Without hesitation he faces within himself the onslaught of,fears, prejudices, envies, hostilities, brutalities,contradictions, the need for love, the need to protect against it, meanness, bitterness, hatred of himself and others. He finds safety only within his rooms. There he can fantasize himself as nobler and where he can act out his dreams of revenge. However, from the vantage point of his underground fortress he sees the dance of the world filled with its trite conventions and honors. The pathetic discourse taken for social life sickens him. He is no good at the game and has no interest in playing it. The problem sets in when he is snubbed, mocked for his poverty, lack of social standing, his poor job. At times he is compelled to act out his hostilities with wretched results. Outraged that those who threw their lives away at the trite, ridiculous party games could look down at one like himself who read, thought, led a higher, deeper life. He held a mirror up from his shabby rooms, not one that could be hung plumb on the back of a door, a wall, but one clearly at a precise angle that reflects the brutality of our species and the creatively refined ways we use to cover this over. We all act from a base, he says early on, and from that base,i.e; honor, an entire set of behaviors becomes justified. He acts from the base of reflection, intellectual perseverance, thought, and reason. These too are subject to the use of finery to cover the growls and animal snarls hissed within, underground. At the end he acknowledges he is a paradoxical character, too; that everything above ground is an attempt to become the average man and in essence is a defense. We would all like to be admired for our joinings, our costumes, the proper trainings of accepted behavior, the hopes for status and honors, and to be included. Possibly literature for its own sake is an answer. Also, he notes, this lover of paradoxes, cannot stop writing here, even though the story must end. Hopefully, he will continue from his underground sanctuary for all time to come. I am counting on it. .", "Short, brisk, Scathing and dark as dark can be.

I\u2019m leaving the answer to those who would read it. Everybody is free to interpret the following as they please. I\u2019m not looking for sympathy. I have enough of that. Here I discovered amazing friends who support me constantly and I am so grateful to them. What I\u2019m doing is facing my fear. I did tell you that I didn\u2019t let anything to be stuck in me, didn't I? I am brave and sincere in a way you can only dream of, oh mighty reader/writer/reviewer. Once I used to call you like that with a pleasure. Now I do so with pity. Because I know that this is all you really have. That\u2019s right. I feel pity for you. I didn\u2019t know what a true psychopath was before having the misfortune/fortune to come across you. Yet, I feel sorry for you, in a way you have never felt sorry for me. Neither for me, nor for anyone else. You did not hesitate to use your own family members and their tragedies - and your own - to seduce me, to gain my sympathy. You had no problem to, albeit indirectly, involve the ones you claim to love in your dirty little hobby. You prayed on my weakness and misplaced affection. I was na\u00efve and paid the price for that. But you are way more na\u00efve believing that there is some sense in what you\u2019re doing. You are na\u00efve in your arrogance. And so you too paid your price. And you will go on paying. And so shall I, I suppose. I know that, if you come to know about this, you will most likely try to hurt me. I have no children for you to threaten, but you still have the means to hurt me. Maybe by revealing something of/about me. Maybe by attacking me virtually in some way. Maybe you are crazy enough to come to my country and city hunting for me. After all, you take trips to different parts of the world just so you could get laid. So why not for revenge as well? Am I afraid of you? Always. I am afraid of you and of the memories of you. Every time I remember the intimacy you and I shared, albeit only through internet, I feel not just like taking a shower. I feel like getting another skin. You were all too happy to tell me about the fantasies you had with my image. I feel sick that such a man like you has laid his eyes on me and knows so much about me and has seen so much of me. So yes, I am afraid of you. Of your past and future self, of what you did and might do to me. Yet, I am doing this. I was terribly hurt to find out how little I have meant to you and how others of your conquests have meant much more to you. But I know now that your indifference was one of the best things that could have happened to me. Because I came to know what you did to the women you find interesting enough. I feel sorry for all of them. Once you thought I was interesting too. While I was still a challenge. But once you got past my defenses, the thrill was gone, wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the chase you\u2019re after, not the end result. Just like a hunter who is interested in his prey only as long as it moves and breathes. Once your arrows went through me and I was lying on the ground, defenseless and wholly in your power, you didn\u2019t want me anymore. But you didn\u2019t walk away instantly. You stuck around to make sure that I was no more than a corpse before leaving me. You broke me. You were determined to hurt me as much as possible before letting go of me. You even befriended me, pretending to be someone else. I will never know for sure why you never got as close to me as you did to your other women. Maybe you thought I was not as good as the rest of the list, maybe your conscience (if you actually have any) has kicked in, maybe something else. You told me in the end that I could never be good enough for you. Maybe you expect me to say now \u201cNo, you are the one who\u2019s not good enough for me\u201d. I won\u2019t, because I know that this was addressed toward me only on a very superficial level. I know that the person you despise the most is you. You don\u2019t realize it, but none of the women you lure, threaten, blackmail, harass, is half the victim you are. You violate mostly yourself. You think you\u2019re super smart and strong? You, who are much older than me, with all your years of experience, education and talents, are as na\u00efve and defenseless as a baby, because you are a victim of your hubris, your lack of self respect and genuine love and compassion. You told me, when you were still playing your poisonous game with me, that you felt sad that my self esteem was not high enough. You told me that you would like to rebuild it. You did. I didn\u2019t know what a true psychopath was until I met you. And when I finally knew, I also came to know how strong I was. I didn\u2019t know that I was brave, intelligent, creative and passionate before you broke me. You broke me, but you also rescued me from myself. From the self-pity I was drowning in. I didn\u2019t know what I was capable of before you pushed me off the cliff and I discovered I had wings. Maybe you thought my willingness to do so much for you and the fact that you could always count on me, that I was so easy and amiable and ready to agree to almost anything, made me boring and pathetic. But this is me. I don\u2019t need games. I would do anything for those I love. (Once I thought you were one of them). I am proud of my generosity. I possess love and passion you can only dream of. I am even good enough to forgive you, even though you don\u2019t feel like you need my forgiveness. I asked you once about the nature of forgiveness. None of us found the exact answer. But whatever forgiveness is, I am bestowing it on you. Regardless of whether you feel you need it or not. I don\u2019t need your attention and affection anymore, I certainly don\u2019t need your lies. All I need is myself. And I discovered myself. I discovered that I am the person I have always dreamed of being. I told you once you were my teacher. And you were. You taught me well. Thank you.\u2022 .", "Dostoyesky's anti-hero is the the first of a long line of existential anti-heroes who followed later in the 20th century. Clearly, here is an utterly loathsome man who is alienated from his brethren by virtue of his own worldview and is victimized by it.

Clearly, here is an utterly loathsome man who is alienated from his brethren by virtue of his own worldview and is victimized by it. In his sublime genius Dostoyevsky sufficiently respects his readers to challenge them to find something, however dreadful it may be, to connect intellectually with a protagonist who is virtually impossible to admire. While so many novelists of his era present protagonists with whom it is hoped that you will connect at deeper levels, Dostoyevsky almost seems to care less whether you find something of yourself in the lonely man living in a wretched room beneath the boards of an apartment on the edge of St. Petersburg apropos of wet snow. The underground man has squandered his gifts to burrow impossibly deep within his interior life, so much so that he has abandoned all social graces and is unwilling or unable to connect with outsiders above-ground. This underground man finds himself \"morbidly developed, as a man of our time ought to be developed... Every decent man of our time is and must be a coward and a slave.\" He is trapped by his superior intellect and his heightened consciousness showers him with agony to leave him without a clue as to how to relate to men and women of any social status. He is entirely, utterly and hopelessly alone living in a random world the sense of which eludes him with its futility. \"I am now living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and utterly futile consolation that it is even impossible for an intelligent man seriously to become anything, and only fools become something. Yes, sir, an intelligent man of the twentieth century must be and is morally obliged to be primarily a characterless being: a man of character, an active figure -- primarily a limited character.\" He foreshadows the players in the dramas of Samuel Beckett and Sartre: \"The final end, gentlemen: better to do nothing... And so, long live the underground.\" He is Nietszche and Kierkegaard in the ways in which they experienced their lives. He is \"The Stranger\" of Camus and a being straight out of \"The Metamorphosis\" of Kafka: \"I'll tell you solemnly that I wanted many times to become an insect.\" Dostoyevsky anticipates the dreadful and perverse 20th century anti-hero Humbert of Nabokov in \"Lolita\" and utterly bewildered, shell-shocked protagonists like Billy Pilgrim in Dresden after its bombing in World War II in \"Slaughterhouse Five\" by Kurt Vonnegut. Honest to a fault, brilliant, alienated and articulate, the underground man asks and answers his own question: \"What can a decent man speak about with the most pleasing? Answer: about himself. So then, I, too, will speak about myself.\" He finds it impossible to channel his intellect into positive action: he lives in a state of nearly total paralysis. Like all good existentialists he is plagued by his own haunting consciousness: \"I am strongly convinced that not only too much consciousness but even any consciousness at all is a sickness... What is the result of heightened consciousness: it is simply to become a scoundrel.\" He wonders how a man of consciousness can have the slightest respect for himself as every primary cause drags with it another and so it goes infinitely. He deems that the express purpose of every intelligent man is \"babble -- a deliberate outpouring from empty into void.\" But he blames himself because he is more intelligent than everyone around him. He scorns the \"good and lofty\" and considers such idealism as building a Crystal Palace, which only leads to getting stuck deeper in the mire underground. The underground man is highly in agreement with Heine who observed, rightly I suspect, in criticism of Rousseau who lied about his life for his vanity in his \"Confessions.\" The educated and well developed man of his time challenges the notion of what is profitable in this \"twopenny bustle\" and scorns reason itself: \"Gentlemen, why don't we reduce all this reasonableness to dust with one good kick?\" But there's much more on this subject which is curious coming, as it does, from an intelligent man: \"Reason, gentlemen, is a fine thing, that is unquestionable, but reason is only reason and satisfies only man's reasoning capacity, while wanting is a manifestation of the whole of life... I, for example, quite naturally want to live so as to satisfy my whole capacity for living and not so as to satisfy just my reasoning capacity alone.\" No magnanimity graces his soul as because of it he would be tormented by the consciousness of its utter futility as Nature does not ask your permission and doesn't care about your wishes or if you like its laws. He invited you to listen to the moaning of an educated 19th century man suffering from a toothache. Point well made and taken. Man is an animal damned by ingratitude and in a classical definition of our species he defines man as \"the ungrateful biped\" and is further distinguished among all other creatures as the only animal which curses. He finds that man is \"comically arranged\" and that somewhere in all of existence there is a joke and perhaps existence is simply a grand hoax foisted upon humanity. For example, he wonders why he has been so arranged with such desires as he possesses or which possess him utterly. When he encounters and seeks relief in a prostitute named Liza, he falls in love, an emotion which betrays and makes a fool of him. But he yields to his nature, as he feels he can do no other, and seeks to win her with his intelligent face and to liberate her from the life of the streets with his intellect: \"I'll get you with these pictures!\" He derides Liza by saying, \"What are you putting in bondage? It's your soul, over which you have no power, that you put in bondage along with your body...And for the sake of what, one wonders, have you ruined your life here?... There is not and never has been any harder or harsher work in the world than this. One would think your heart alone would simply pour itself out in tears.\" On the subject of love in his underground dreams he describes it as \"God's mystery\" and later as the yielding right to become tyrannized by your lover. Most of all, the anti-hero is Dostoyesky, the author, penning immortal lines of literature from debtor's prison. \"Our discussion is serious... I am not going to bow and scrape before you. I have the underground.\" He taunts his readers boldly, as few novelists before him have written, as to be \"so gullible as to imagine I will publish all this and, what's more, give it to you to read... I shall never have any readers.\" Ultimately, what does the underground man want most of all? \"I longed for 'peace,' I longed to be left alone in the underground. 'Living life' so crushed me, unaccustomed to it as I was, that it even became difficult for me to breathe.\" In the end he insults his readers by advising them that his notes are only his work to carry to an extreme what his readers, you and I, are too cowardly to carry and chides all of us for taking comfort in our morbid and possibly surreal self-deception, a major theme later developed by Sartre in \"Existentialism Is a Humanism.\" \"But enough: I don't want to write any more 'from Underground\" with a capital \"U\" this time. However, in another paradox in the last lines his notes continue because the underground man can't help himself and went on scribbling his babble anyway. To understand clearly the influence of this Father of Existentialism in 20th century literature, one must first understand this germinal literary classic. .", "I first met the Russian on the loading docks.

Filling trailers with freight out in the weather, in the humid heat and then again in the freezing cold was not a career, not a job anyone especially wanted, it was a job to fill in the gaps, work that paid a wage and filled a need as necessary as the empty trailers that backed into the dock one after the other.I had seen him in the break room, out on the picnic tables - always alone. He scribbled incessantly in an old thesis book, would pause long moments staring into space, as still as a statue, and then would bend his head and write feverishly.Sometimes he would sit quietly on his break, with a thin old paperback or a tattered library book in his lap. Passing once, I could not help glancing over his shoulder and saw that his book was a collection of poems.Another time, in the cold of January, when we all dressed like astronauts in plump suits, or like Eskimos in thick woolen parkas, the Russian was dressed in a thin old ragged coat and cloth gloves with holes in several fingers. He looked ill, and little doubt, we still had hours to go on our shift and his only head covering was the sparse patch of thinning hair atop his sallow scalp. I remembered having an extra woolen cap in my locker, and fetched it and then offered it to him without a word, just held it out. It was a colorful winter toboggan hat with a bright red fluffy ball atop. He looked up at me and seemed to almost decline, he looked embarrassed to wear the warm cap, as if its incongruous color atop his sullen head would be a greater hindrance than the warmth it would provide. A dirty hand ventured up and took the cap and black eyes beneath scruffy brows looked into me, seeking to discover was this true kindness or a jest at his expense. I smiled and he seemed to relax, and a thickly accented \u201cthanks\u201d drifted up from his stringy mustache and beard.The other dockworkers said of him that when they worked a trailer in tandem, he spoke very little or nothing at all, loading mechanically and only passing information as needed.My first trailer with him was on a cold night in March and the brisk pace of the work kept us warm. I tried to spark a conversation, but he only answered in grunts and shrugs.Another time I got him to speak a little, talked some about his origins and his life before this. At the end of the load, he smiled shyly, thanked me for the winter cap, reached from his back pocket, returned it and gave me a firm handshake. I returned the grip and looked at him and saw again those eyes that seemed to look into me.\u201cI\u2019m Lyn,\u201d I said. \u201cFyodor.\u201dAfter that we slowly began to talk, to share ideas. Working together, Fyodor told me about his writing, during breaks, he would read aloud.\u201cTalking nonsense is the sole privilege mankind possesses over the other organisms. It's by talking nonsense that one gets to the truth! I talk nonsense, therefore I'm human.\u201d\u201cMan only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness.\u201d\u201cI say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.\u201d\u201cTo love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise.\u201dFyodor was \u2026 insane. He was inspired, passionate, angry, hurt, a victim, a survivor, a damaged soul that had lived beyond torture and then had been able to describe the journey into hell and the ascent past.There were days that I had to walk away from him, unable to meet the brutal honesty, the too focused intensity, I had to step away.\u201cI am alone, I thought, and they are everybody.\u201dAnd I would scream at him, but also screaming at myself, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way, damn you! Life is not this black and white, you are not the final judge and jury, you cannot cut down to our souls like a scalpel, it is not your place to examine us, you are ONE OF US!!\u201dAnd he answered: \u201cI love, I can only love the one I've left behind, stained with my blood when, ungrateful wretch that I am, I extinguished myself and shot myself through the heart. But never, never have I ceased to love that one, and even on the night I parted from him I loved him perhaps more poignantly than ever. We can truly love only with suffering and through suffering! We know not how to love otherwise. We know no other love. I want suffering in order to love. I want and thirst this very minute to kiss , with tears streaming down my cheeks, this one and only I have left behind. I don't want and won't accept any other.\u201dAnd I had to get away. I quit, I left, and I separated myself from him. Who was he to say these things, who was he to judge me, to judge all of us??Yet I could not forget, could not stop thinking of his words, could not get away from those eyes that delved into me..", "Madness...This is madness, I tell you!

Perhaps too personal for my tastes, because I had the misfortune of hating the narrator. He is a coward, a coward who yearns to be courageous, but in all the wrong ways. He wishes to strike down those that have wronged him, but after listening to his self-absorption, imagined slights, and impossibly high and complicated morals, I myself wished to strike him down with a solid backhand, one I hope would wake him up to his own idiocy. Likely it would only get me added to his hate list.Did you notice what happened there? I felt the urge to hit a fictional character. Well played, Dostoevsky, well played. That is the writer's genius, to craft a character I felt was real enough to touch.

But I thought you might have gotten stuck somewhere and would be probably on your way.D: Really? Think again.I: Well, may be I wanted to meet you.D: And waiting made you feel good!I: Certainly not!D: Oh very much, my lady. The waiting was a pain which during the first hour was scratching at your consciousness. But once it seeped in, you began enjoying it. Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.I: Rubbish. How can someone enjoy suffering?D: Have you ever dabbed your nail over a dry cut on your skin? And with every dab, a shrill of pain running through your nerves bringing you a sense of enjoyment after a while? So much that you continue the activity?I: Perhaps some moments were\u2026D: There!

You could make me tall or short, contort my face to suit your image, sway the discussion to merge with your thoughts.

This book is no typical fun, summer read. However, if you stick with it, some of Dostoyevsky's insights into the human condition will not only make you say \"that's me!\" (though you probably won't admit it), they might even make you laugh. One of the reasons this book is so difficult is due to the narrator. He is obviously a geniusNotes from Underground is one of the most challenging little books I've read since my stint with Faulkner a few years ago. Dostoyevsky demands your complete attention. This book is no typical fun, summer read. However, if you stick with it, some of Dostoyevsky's insights into the human condition will not only make you say \"that's me!\" (though you probably won't admit it), they might even make you laugh. One of the reasons this book is so difficult is due to the narrator. He is obviously a genius, but his often contradictory ravings leave the reader confused and unable to grasp his true character. Contradiction then, becomes the narrator's essence, and right when you think you have a handle on what he's saying--his proclamation of cowardice for example--he says something very bold and outragous! I have NOT done any research on Dostoyevsky or this book, but I must admit that I did read the afterward by the book's editor, Andrew R. MacAndrew. In the afterward, Macandrew offers some very valuable information about Dostoyevsky: First, Dostoyevsky is a Christian. This fact is not hugely important. I just thought his pathos was extremely dark and his vision of humanity very dim for a Christian. Second, the book's narrator is an \"anti-hero\"--one whom Dostoyevsky himself dislikes very much. The book is separated into two sections. The first section's narrator is 40 years old and writes from the vantage point of his \"mousehole.\" The mousehole basically means underground, isolated, lonely, and quite possibly manic-depressive. This narrator takes pleasure in humiliation and claims that he is entirely motivated by boredom. I found this sad because the narrator obviously has a great talent for rhetoric, even though his meanderings often end up in silly contradiction! Ultimately, the narrator of the first section is reduced to nothingness, because for all his genius condemnations of the \"crystal palace\" (utopia), he has nothing to offer in its place save destitution and sorrow. As readers we are taken in by his bravado and let down by his eventual futility.The second section gives hints that the narrator is the same, but this time he is 24 years old. This section is more of a narrative tale and contains far less philosophy than the first. It seems to be the prior narrator's \"philosophy\" in action rather than just through words. This section is actually quite a page turner, and Dostoyevsky's great skill at simple prose comes shining through. I found the anti-hero of this section absolutely dissapointing and unpredictable--perhaps the finest possible characteristics of an anti-hero! Regardless of the narrator's flaws, this section forces us to ask what our primary motivations are in life. To be a follower or a leader, and if we choose to lead, will we do it with arrogance or humility? These are very valid questions when one considers the political upheaval in Russia between the Czars and the socialists, not to mention the simple idea of the corruptibility of power at any level. My favorite part of the book is on the second to last page. Despite all the narrators \"issues,\" he offers one final thought that is both intriguing and universal. It is actually an ethical question, and for me, it encapsulates the most important theme of the book. In his darkest hour of regret, when he realizes he has abandoned the opportunity to love he asks:\"What's better--cheap happiness or lofty suffering? Well, tell me--which of the two is better?\"You either \"get it\" or you don't. Great book. .", "I accidentally stumbled across Notes from the Underground in my early 20s and was stunned.

I had never read anything like it before.

Dostoevsky\u2019s Underground Man argues (although inconsistently and contradictorily) for exercising free will or even whim, so therefore any planned utopia could never be possible. The second part was a personal journey into the narrator\u2019s disturbing world \u2013 a man with a deep seated inferiority complex masked by a presumed moral or intellectual superiority, a man unable to connect with others but obsessively concerned about their opinions, a man who feels he sees all sides of every issue and is therefore paralyzed into indecision, and a man whose heart is estranged from his head by ego fantasies. He is given a shot at redemption, at personal salvation through the possibility of love with Liza, and he fails miserably.How is this relevant to us today and why bother to read it? One hundred fifty years after Notes was published, we see countless examples of people making decisions (their personal choices) that psychologists and sociologists would say clearly go against their own long term self-interest. And Dostoyevsky takes us inside the thinking of the Underground Man (or the alienated man) in a very personal way that Bloom says exposes our own crippling self-consciousness and causes us to worry how much he may be speaking for us. A truly amazing novella by one of world's first great contributors to psychology.

But I couldn\u2019t. I almost told her to stop reading it, but as it was her choice, I let her finish it alone (and felt a horrible mother for that).Dostoyevsky can be a master of words and NFU can be one of the greatest works by one of the greatest writers, one of the first existentialists novels, but, well, opposing the Underground Man\u2019s arrogance, I have to say:- I may have somehow missed all the intelligent, thoughtful musings on the condition of mankind;- Maybe I misinterpreted everything the Underground Man had to say about the modern man, utopianism, rationalism, et cetera. But maybe exactly because of my eternal faith in mankind \u2014 in spite of its nastiness \u2014, I couldn\u2019t see anything redeeming about the Underground Man (not about the literary work).The character\u2019s spite and his choice to remain with an untreated liver disease corroded not only his mind, but also his character \u2014 which he didn\u2019t seem to have had any since I could find nothing to vouch for it in his early life. The lack of medical treatment just because and his reasoning (?!) of masochism and sadism levels humans can achieve and perpetuate while enduring aches and pains of a sickness, well, made me sick.The Underground Man is a misanthropic beyond redemption, albeit intelligent and educated he is the lowest form of humanity, frustrated, powerless and inert by his own laziness, with a disturbed mind, totally lacking in social skills and, unlike he affirms, not having an ounce of self-respect or self-love. He deliberately punishes himself and everyone around him.His thoughts and actions are paradoxical. He is emotionally tough \u2014 even insensitive \u2014 then emotionally fragile. He stands for great unequivocal moral virtue, then cowers further in his morally rotten state.He needs love, but rejects it whenever it might be obtainable.Either in penance for UM's irredeemably flawed human nature, or to drive out the cold void of life's existential nothingness with misery and pain, I found NFU to be a form of self-flagellation \u2014 maybe it was meant to \u2014 but I am not as masochist as the Underground Man.Is everything so meaningless? Is human nature so rotten and awful?\u201cBut, since nothing can be explained by reason, why reason?\u201dWhy reason? Why?!Because.Because there are other possibilities than inertia, than arrogance, than living in a dirty, dark and self-consuming underground.Because while there is life, there is hope.Just because. The Underground Man took much from me and gave me nothing back that I felt like my soul has been sucked away from my body.If the Underground Man was a part of FD\u2019s psyche, all I can say is I\u2019m glad he could get it out of his chest; perhaps he found a bit of hope and redemption for himself afterward.All said and done, I\u2019ll refrain from rating NFU - not only because I have none literary skills to rate Dostoyevsky - also because I\u2019m sure it will please many other readers.-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --P.S. - I didn't find the Underground Man to be depressed or with any mental problem which could justify my lending him a hand. He is extremely cognizant of the condition he has deliberately chosen to be in and remains so by his laziness, arrogance and utter discredit to a \"lesser\" society (and its integrants).If I had detected any afflicting malady, my review would be completely different..", "This is my first Dostoyevsky and I chose it because it is short, but that doesn't reduce it's value or place in the literary world.

But oh, I'm ranting now. One of these days I'll hopefully be able to give Dostoyevsky the justice he is due.* * *Written on May 13, 2013:Notes from Underground is my first Fyodor Dostoyevsky novel, and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. While the book is not necessarily hard to understand, it is not an easy read. It required serious focus and attention for one to be able to fully grasp the depth of the words.At the first part of the story, the narrator rattled off about consciousness, inertia, twice two equals four, sublime and beautiful, etcetera. Primarily it was where he laid off the groundwork of his thoughts about various things. It was easy to be pulled into this man\u2019s mind\u2014and while at the beginning I was having an idea of how mad he was, soon enough, I actually found myself agreeing to him. He was intelligent and his perceptions of things were very unconventional, and yet . . . one couldn\u2019t just help realizing that there had to be some truth in what he was jotting down. And oddly enough, I would admit that I even felt some of what he had written, although I was just not brave enough myself to put it into writing or to ponder on it more. But certainly I had experienced it, but I was not fully aware how much those things matter to me until I have read this book. The writing style was simply amazing: descriptive, concrete, and direct. It is reminiscent in a way of Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cstream-of-consciousness\u201d still, but only very slightly. You would read exactly as the writer would formulate the thoughts. You would read about his uncertainty of himself, you would read about his conflicting thoughts and emotions. I was struck about how much I was able to relate to him as a writer, especially the part about writing to an audience, but not necessarily wanting to publish the writing in any way. He seemed to echo all the thoughts I had that I weren\u2019t able to completely wield into words.I don\u2019t think I should be saying this: but I can strongly relate to this man. Does that mean I am going crazy as well? Sure enough he must be more superior to me, and definitely he was more eloquent and intelligent, but the narrator was able to awake my consciousness into thoughts that had always been in my mind but were still jumbled, as well as the fact that I felt the same way he did about many things. For some reasons, I feel slightly vulnerable that my unthinkable thoughts were put on paper and described precisely by someone else. The second part of the book was more engaging and more of a page turner, mostly because in here the readers could finally see the protagonist in action and a part of the real world. Here we could see how his ideas\u2014as presented in the first part\u2014would influence his actions. We would have a glimpse of how very powerful and dark his thoughts were, and yet, in action he was somewhat weak and cowardly. At first we might have the notion that he had the capability to kill someone, but his paradoxical behavior would prove otherwise. This was illustrated strongly towards the end, when he said he was incapable of love, and yet he was devastated by the loss of Liza. This stark contrast is a potent symbolism for human nature and our society.Notes from Underground is highly provocative and would definitely make you think about the intricacies of the human mind and the possible wrongness of our society and world as a whole. The writing style is sarcastic and hilarious. In a few instances one would just laugh at the wit of the protagonist. The darkly sinister thoughts and the ironic manner in which it was narrated is another image of the contrariness of the whole novel. The ending of the book would leave the readers thinking and wanting to see more of this antihero. I give this masterpiece five-stars, and this is definitely something that I would read again and again. I know that every time I finish it, I will see the book in a new light and I will as well be able to perceive my surroundings differently..", "The more I read Dostoyevsky the more I am convinced that nobody on earth understood human nature and the labyrinth that a human mind is more than he did.

To be simpler, it's a champion of Individualism, and is against all utopias, totalitarianism, any kind of dogmatism, and the evaluation of human beings on the basis of their intelligence alone(History says that Dostoevsky wrote this book as a response to the revolutionary novel titled 'What is to be done?' which was read by Lenin five times in one summer, and which eventually formed the emotional support of Russian Revolution and every blood shed that followed).The Underground man is an extremely intelligent one, conscious and has a sense of \"beautiful and lofty\"(a term borrowed from Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant)and considers himself a 'developed man'. Because of this exalted sense of his own self he considers the rest of the men around him with contempt, feeling of hatred although at the same time, paradoxically, he is also afraid of them and thinks that people around him are better than him. Throughout his life he remains in the dark cellar, day dreaming, spiteful, shameful, lazy, paranoiac and detached from every other human being around him. He tells us that, in his youth, he tried rather earnestly to live by the ideals he found in European literature and philosophy. He talks to us, or rather write to himself, after 40 years of underground life. Full of monologues, confessions and ramblings he writes about the effects of the philosophy he chose in his early life. His problems are the problems of every thinking man; every intellectual; every individual who takes pride in his intelligence - his pettiness, his contempt for the people around him, his arrogance, his yearning for a recognition for his intelligence and moral goodness, his weakness, his doubts, ridiculousness, inaction, indecision. Is he a hero? Yes. Is he above ordinary folks? Definitely Yes. He is more self-aware, conscious, has literary merits in his writings and more articulate......Then why did he choose to stay in a corner, spiteful and contemptuous? Was he afraid? Yes. But afraid of what? His spite is a veil; a cover to protect himself; to protect his inner sanctity, purity, jaded innocence - above all his individuality, one of the few things he possess.An individuality which he has grown around a philosophy(of course, its none other than but that of Kant) which takes reason as the only parameter to choose one's actions, and consequently led to him live a life of inaction. By holding reason alone as his standard he swept himself off to endless reflection for he came up with multiple motives to act and the sheer multiplicity drowned him in self-doubts. Action became impossible to him because he was unable to choose the best course of action. If reason alone be applied to the reality, what remains to us is just absurdity, vagueness and death.I have never really realized the true meaning of these words of Bertrand Russell until I came to know of our underground man:  \"Is not faith in reason alone a dangerous creed? No sensible man, however agnostic, has \"faith in reason alone.\" Reason is concerned with matters of fact, some observed, some inferred. The question whether there is a future life and the question whether there is a God concern matters of fact, and the agnostic will hold that they should be investigated in the same way as the question, \"Will there be an eclipse of the moon tomorrow?\"\u00a0 But matters of fact alone are not sufficient to determine action, since they do not tell us what ends we ought to pursue. In the realm of ends, we need something other than reason.....a realm which is not that of reason, though it should be in no degree contrary to it. The realm I mean is that of emotion and feeling and desire.\"Man rebels as long as he remains conscious. Even our underground man is a rebel. He rebelled by staying in a corner protecting his individuality although it is already ruined by his philosophy he accepted long back.\"If you pretend, your whole body rebels\", they say. Is that not true of him? Although he pretended himself a hero in front of the innocent whore giving long sermons on love, he later felt ashamed, trembled, agonized for them in his loneliness. And Is that not what we do? To think of ourselves as a hero, just because...just because we read books; not because we have understood life, but we understood books. \"...for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We don\u2019t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered.\"To act; to become a hero, man requires not only intelligence but something more - something more like courage, character, insight, sympathy. Not only to act but also to love. He could have fallen in love for the redeemed harlot but for his reasons; reasons he learnt from books alone. Reason is all enough to call a whore, a whore. But it requires something more to call a whore, a human.Next time, when we choose our philosophy and ideals, lets remember our underground man. Lets remember that we are all human beings with a mind made of conscious, subconscious and unconscious layers. And that our consciousness is just one-third of our mind and the faculty of reason is just one-third of our consciousness.Let us always remember these lines of Shakespeare(Hamlet), \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\".", "In high school I actually did a monologue from the opening chapter.

Then they can see it's been done, it's been done as well as it can be done, better than they could possibly do it, and it still ain't all that great. Here's as good as it can get when you really don't have any experience at anything in the world. When you're trying to write what you know and you don't really know anything.\u201dI agree with almost everything, except the last part. This book is about something important, something that keeps getting written about because it needs to be written about -- modern society often values very shallow forms of success. The sensitive writer, often devoted to a different kind of success, become contemptuous of this mainstream world and its trappings. Catcher in the Rye, Franny and Zooey were about these things -- and reasonable people seem to rate these books by J.D. Salinger very low on Goodreads -- as if to say, why can\u2019t these sissy writers give up the whole truth, beauty, and wisdom thing and just get a job already. Go to business school, be successful, and stop whining. An Underground Novel has to do several things to be successful: it has to present a hero/ anti-hero who holds up alternative values. This is perhaps the most essential thing. This hero must falter in holding up these values, secretly longing for the simpler form of success presented by mainstream society. And finally, the hero/ anti-hero must suffer a tragic failure to show how horribly oppressive our dominant notion of success is. These are probably not the only things, but these are the main things. Future books will try to do this. Some will succeed (Fight Club, Trainspotting!).This is the very nature of the Underground Novel -- and as the model of an underground novel, this novel must be seen as a success, no? After all, we can\u2019t judge it as \u201cNotes from People Who are Overall Quite Successful, But Suffer From a Few Trivial Problems\u201d (this would probably be closer to a sitcom). A novel must be judged on its own merits, I think. An Underground Novel can\u2019t be anything other than it is -- a tragedy of the sick, whiny, and under-successful in a world that can\u2019t see their virtues. .", "I am a sick man. . . .I am a spiteful man.

Some might say this is the first modernist existential book to hit the shelves. Some might think it is thin and spiteful. While I won't disagree, I will add that this book cracks me up, as in double over while chuckling. It's like a funny version of the movie Taxi Driver.For instance, near the beginning the protagonist, or perhaps antagonist, writes of people that know how to avenge themselves (which is central to the plot), asking \"How do they do it?\", and goes on to say that \"Such a man will push on straight toward his goal like a raging bull with lowered horns, and only a wall might stop him.\" Then he goes on talking all kinds of stuff about simple direct people and walls. At the end of that parenthetical rambling he says \"...But more about walls later.\", which somehow that cracks me up, foreshadowing talk about walls. Maybe it's the syntax that cracks me up. Maybe you had to be there.Don't get me wrong, this is a crushing tale of inaction and indecision. The reader is directly addressed by this spiteful ex-government official and told things that will make almost any reader's face wrinkle up or go dead like a victim of Bell's Palsy. I mean this guy verbally abuses a prostitute, in part to feel better about himself. It is a Note of not being good enough in society, of a constant questioning and self-doubt, and as a result self abusive to the point of almost suicidal rage.I know a lot of people may think that this book shows that this kind of spite for society and people like the main character who quit their jobs and say things like, \"They-they won't let me\u2013I\u2013I can't be good!\", are proven to be irrational and ultimately uncooperative, and that it is their own fault. I still say much of the book is a serious critique of society that this anti-hero raises his tiny mouse fists against.By the way, I think I'll plagiarize those first lines and make a country song..", "\u2018I\u2019m a sick man\u2026 a mean man.

But what makes you think that man either can or should be changed in this way?\u2019After making his case, the second part of the novel details certain major events in the narrator\u2019s life that give an insight into his character. It is an existential novel that attacks the modernism and the emerging of the Western philosophy in the 19th century. He attacks rationalism and believes that it underestimates the human desire for free will. Absurdly, the Underground Man prefers to suffer in silence from his liver condition, rather than submit himself to the \u2018law of reason\u2019 that claims that only doctors can cure it. This example goes beyond its literal implication and elucidates the narrator\u2019s philosophical point of view. He has purposefully alienated himself from a society that he dooms too cerebral and without a soul.This novel consists of a first-person confession told by a hyper-conscious, hateful man. It explores absurdity, alienation, isolation, and radical personal freedom. Philosophers and writers would later be influenced by Dostoyevsky\u2019s unique school of thought that would inspire existentialism..", "\"Real life oppressed me with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe\".Ahhh Incredible!

The Underground Man is isolated from the society hence the name is a symbol for his solitary life. He's intelligent, conscious, educated, skeptical, bitter, analytical, full of contradictions, vengeful, paranoid, loner, indecisive and believes he's much more intelligent than any of the people he knows but at the same time he loathes himself and second guesses all of his actions which prevents him from having confidence or accomplishing anything in his life and having or maintaining any kind of semi normal relationship with anyone, having no real life experiences upon which he can base his opinions and thoughts, he mostly relies on novels and literature that provides him with realities of worlds he lives in instead of his reality which alienates him from society even more. Now Dostoyevsky never ceases to amaze me with his weird twisted characters and quotes like \u201c Shall the world go to hell, or shall I not have my tea? I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.\u201d ( In my case I'll replace tea with coffee ) i'm not sure it's a good character to relate to this much but i can't help but relate to him and i'm hoping it's my feverish and delirious brain's doings and that is that..", "\"Real life oppressed me with it's novelty so much that I could not breath\" notes from the underground is, exactly what it's name implies, notes from the underground.

But he has so much to say and everything he says renders truth and often times perplexing and terrifying and heartbreaking. Dostoyevsky is dramatic to say the least but he gives such importance to the role of humanity you end up, I ended up, hating , loving, fearing the idea of being alive, and mostly a slight sense of obligation towards what, I don't know. This book was especially painful because you get to witness this unnamed anti hero's struggles with social situations and his rather extreme case of poor social manners and inability to connect or be comfortable with anyone. This was very realistic, I think. Although a lot of people I see here and elsewhere tend to wonder how someone so extremely self loathing, impolite and isolated could exist but I know for a fact such people exist they are just, as is mentioned in the book, the extreme cases. I wonder what Dostoyevsky has gone through to know so much and portray so well the destructive effects of total isolation. Yet, even the alternative, through this book, is portrayed as equally meaningless and redundant which, is what made the whole thing so realistic and captivating. \"No one ever plans to sleep out in the gutter, sometimes that's just the most comfortable place\" -bright eyes \"we are nowhere and it's now\".", "What a great finish.

Entering the thoughts of one of his antiheroes is like donning a hair shirt. Or perhaps that assessment is too harsh, because in spite of the discomfort there is something enjoyable about reading Dostoevsky that comes from the quick and cunning sense of humor which flashes here and there amongst all that scratchy hair like strands of silver thread---it isn\u2019t comforting so much as it is delightful to behold, made shinier by contrast. There is the golden thread of intelligence here as well, binding up the seams, fastening the reader more tightly into the odious garment. So perhaps the hair shirt analogy is apt after all, especially in light of Dostoevsky\u2019s recurrent obsession with suffering, even of the most banal variety, as a process by which the soul is distilled. In Part One of Notes from Underground, the narrator introduces himself as \u201ca sick man\u201d and \u201ca wicked man.\u201d His tone is hostile, he feels persecuted, wallows in self-pity, then will not permit himself to wallow, his mind swarms with bitter fantasies of revenge, he chokes on a sense of his superiority but finding no evidence of it within himself he contents himself with finding fault in others, he spurs himself spitefully onward, he is crippled by paroxysms of humiliation and personal failure. He launches into a diatribe against Chernyshevsky\u2019s What is to be Done? then stabs halfheartedly at Buckle, Burke, and Rousseau (among others) before returning to rancorous allusions to Russians like N.N. Ge, and A.E. Anaevsky whose work, I confess (another of Dostoevsky\u2019s preoccupations in this book: the need to confess) I am not familiar with. The torturous content of Part One is stitched together with arguments against utopian idealism, the assertion that free will trumps innate goodness, and a quickly sketched outline of a philosophy of contrariness. Part Two: Apropos of Wet Snow continues to make tangential and often critical references to other Russian authors while the narrator revisits three sordid memories. He remembers a soldier who inadvertently insulted him by brusquely passing him in a bar (and insulted him further by never noticing him.) Then he recalls a going away dinner some of his former classmates had for a friend of theirs, how he invited himself, and behaved obnoxiously out of a muddled sense of superiority, inferiority, and desperation for friendship. His most painful memory however centers on Liza, the heart of his garrulous narrative, a young prostitute he meets at a brothel after the going away dinner, and the contemptible way he treats her that night and again later when she shows up at his house. By sending her away his heartlessness becomes irreparable.When the underground man introduces himself to the reader Dostoevsky appears briefly at the door, speaking through the keyhole of a footnote while the underground man continues, oblivious to the authors presence, importunately addressing the reader through the floorboards. Dostoevsky asserts that while the underground man is fictional this type of man \u201cnot only may, but even must exist in our society, taking into consideration the circumstances under which our society has generally been formed.\u201d If I am to take him at his word then this is a critique of the social ills that produce such a miserable little man and the ideas that beleaguer his festering brain. Dostoevsky says nothing about Liza but he has used a hapless prostitute before (Sonya, in Crime and Punishment) for the dual purpose of yardstick by which the reader can measure the antiheros sin, and as the bringer of love, more suffering, and the possibility of salvation, although the underground man opts to take his suffering without love or salvation.The social ills, the \u201ccircumstances\u201d that Dostoevsky mentions are different than those that I would enumerate, and the clues are in the underground man\u2019s reading material. I suspect the underground man is a precursor to Antonin Artaud, a sort of self-loathing madman whose mind has been polluted by the decadence of western culture. The underground man is such a champion of free will however, that I would hold him more personally accountable than Dostoevsky does. The underground man has all kinds of opportunities but he prefers to sulk alone, and while I empathize with him because he suffers I stop short of blaming society, as Dostoevsky would have me do. Besides, there is Liza, who is a far more plausible victim of \u201ccircumstances\u201d and she seems solely to exist in the memory of the underground man, in his narrative, and in the book so that she can be abused. At the end of Notes from Underground the underground man momentarily comforts himself with the thought that perhaps the suffering he has caused her will purify her soul, will grant her access to salvation, but he dismisses the thought unwilling to grant himself that comfort, and I dismiss that idea as well although I don\u2019t think Dostoevsky intends for his reader to cleave suffering and salvation in two so easily.Dostoevsky is a great chronicler of \u201ctorments and tormenticules\u201d as his bestiary of characters can easily attest. He writes a great internal monologue, keeps the rooms bare of all but the most necessary props and then fills up space with internal demons projected outwards. He is at his artistic best with the full-fledged \u201ctorments\u201d in the big books, like the Brothers Karamazov or Crime and Punishment. He depicts the \u201ctormenticules\u201d in exquisite detail in stories like The Double, but he is too earnest he cannot carry the tragic in one hand and the comic in the other as Gogol did in Dead Souls. Dostoevsky lacks the agility needed for satire, becoming bogged down instead in suffering and psychosis. He can be funny but he fumbles with his sense of humor and drops it entirely when he starts chasing salvation. Notes from Underground has some of strengths as the longer books, forceful descriptions of a man struggling with his conscience, examination of philosophical, spiritual, and emotional abnegation of goodness, and a pathos that he somehow manages to dredge up for the most disagreeable characters. It is this pathos, finally, that I find most compelling in Dostoevsky\u2019s work, because personal suffering is just suffering, what is meaningful is the ability to cast a kind eye on the suffering of others.."], "shelves": ["read-in-2014", "best-ever", "re-read", "interiority", "favorites", "epic-stuff", "classics", "favorites", "translated", "r-r-rs", "philosophy", "history-europe", "direct-phil", "5-stars", "translated", "for_legacy", "philo", "favorites", "russia", "monologue", "sharp_sword", "fiction", "reviews-5-stars", "reviews", "dos-toy-evsky", "favorites", "philosophical-fiction", "psychology", "literature-russian", "19th-century", "classics", "existencialism", "russian", "deserves-another-chance", "dark-characters", "guardian-1000", "reviewed-books", "2015-book-challenge", "rated-books", "russian", "favorites", "read-in-2013", "close-to-my-heart", "\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629-\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628-\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0636\u0644\u0629", "\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a-2013", "\u0645\u0641\u0636\u0644\u0627\u062a-2013", "favorites", "russian-literature", "epic", "favorites", "existentialism-nihilism-absurdism", "close-to-heart", "thought-provoking-mind-blowing", "favorites", "1001", "russian", "readings-worth-a-lifetime", "favorite-authors", "literature", "fiction", "to-be-read-before-i-bid-adieu", "favorites", "philosophy", "dangerous-books", "fyodor-dostoevsky", "russian", "own", "read-more-than-once", "favorites", "masterpiece", "exceptional-books", "favourites", "books-to-buy", "most-influential-books", "russian-literature", "favorites", "russiamothergloom", "reflectionofownfuck", "fiction"], "id": 4}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "Walden", "author": "Henry David Thoreau", "avg_rating": 3.78, "review_count": 177202, "url": "/book/show/16902.Walden", "description": "Originally published in 1854, Walden; or, Life in the Woods, is a vivid account of the time that Henry D.

After reading about the influence the book had on Gandhi, I had attempted reading Walden many (roughly four) times before and each time had to give up before the tenth page due to the onrush of new ideas that enveloped me. I put away the book each time with lots of food for thought and always hoped to finish it one day. Now after finally finishing the book, while I was elated and elevated by the book, I just wish that Thoreau had stuck to telling about the affairs of men and their degraded ways of living and about his alternate views. Maybe even a detailed account of his days and how it affected him would have been fine but when he decided to write whole chapters about how to do bean cultivation and how to measure the depth of a pond with rudimentary methods and theorizing about the reason for the unusual depth of walden and about the habits of wild hens, sadly, I lost interest.

The concluding chapter, to an extent, rewarded me for my persistence and toil. In this final chapter, he comes back to the real purpose of the book: to drill home a simple idea - \"I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws will be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings.\"This I think was the core philosophy of the book - if you pursue the ideal direction/vision you have of how your life should be, and not how convention dictates it should be, then you will find success and satisfaction on a scale unimaginable through those conventional routes or to those conventional minds.I will of course be re-reading the book at some point and thankfully I will know which parts to skip without any remorse..", "I will go against the grain of society here and say that this was not worth it.

He lived in a shack on land that a friend of his owned so he was basically a squatter. Most of the food he ate he was given by townsfolk who were alternately intrigued by his way of living or felt sorry for him. These are the same people he is judging for their way of life, yet he is dependent on them! Also, and this may be just because I already strive for a simplified life, hardly a one of his truisms felt fresh or inspiring to me. It was a book full of self importance and judgement on society, not a man I would want to have an afternoon chat with. I understand that at the time, his ideas were totally out there and revolutionary, but he is too bombastic about the whole thing, as if he himself had single handedly figured it all out. I was seriously dissapointed and hope Emerson will be better..", "Or \"The Guy Who Liked to Go Outside and Do Stuff\". If Thoreau were alive today, I bet he'd be one of those guys who won't shut up about how he \"doesn't even own\" a television. Curiously, however, I don't think he'd smell bad. And he'd find Radiohead neither overrated nor God's gift to modern music. Just a talented band with a few fairly interesting ideas. Or \"The Guy Who Liked to Go Outside and Do Stuff\".

I also got the impression that Thoreau was the kind of guy I could never be friends with. In Into the Wild (which I read at the same time during intervals when Walden became too much to bear), Jon Krakauer describes Thoreau as \"staid and prissy.\" I agree, and I'd also add \"holier than thou.\" At many points in the book, his attitude seems to be, \"If you're not living your life exactly like me, then you're just stupid.\" Which aggravated me because, while I can see the merit of his way of life, I don't necessarily think one has to take it to the extremes he did to reap the same benefits. That said, there were parts of his philosophy that I want to try to carry out in my own life, and I know that this is a book that I'll refer to again and again throughout my life. But will I ever read the whole thing through again? Doubtful..", "Walden is a phenomenal piece of writing that has the power to completely alter your way of thinking and the way in which you see the world. To put it plainly, I feel like I have been looking for Walden (or a book like it) for my entire life. It is a book a about a man who has had enough of society and all its trappings; it is a book about a man who understands that modern life is inauthentic and false: it is not a reflection of how we ought to be living as per our biology and our natural animal Walden is a phenomenal piece of writing that has the power to completely alter your way of thinking and the way in which you see the world. To put it plainly, I feel like I have been looking for Walden (or a book like it) for my entire life. It is a book a about a man who has had enough of society and all its trappings; it is a book about a man who understands that modern life is inauthentic and false: it is not a reflection of how we ought to be living as per our biology and our natural animal instinct. And to regain some sense of authenticity, he goes to live in the woods by himself. He builds his own home with his own hands; he grows his own food; he practices frugality and minimalist living; he turns his back on materialism, consumerism and society at large: he tries to live in way that is completely true to himself. His motivations for doing so were quite simple: he wanted to feel alive and that when he reached his death bed, he would not feel like he had wasted his life (as so many others will):\u201cI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\u201d What is also strikingly powerful about Walden, a book published in 1864, is how modern it is and how awake it is. Reading this today as a vegan and an environmentalist with a mind attuned to contemporary ecological concern, reveals just how important books like this are. Back then Thoreau understood how easy it was to live off plant-based food. He understood that it was cheaper, cleaner, and not detrimental to his health. And he wanted to be totally off-grid. I find historical examples of this fascinating because they are examples of how some writers understood exactly what was needed for the development of humanity.\u201cI have no doubt that is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals.\u201dI feel like many writers, philosophers and poets have known this fact for a long time. And here, as in many cases, eating plant-based food is utilised to become more natural and to, as Thoreau puts it, eat like the animals do. I feel like Thoreau has been reading the work of Rousseau here, but he never mentions him. Despite this, Thoreau does also hunt and fish in the book, but his mind always turns back to the animals involved and what harm his actions are causing them. He knows it is time to change and to move forward. It is worth mentioning here that Walden is quite dense, and the archaic prose and lofty descriptions will scare away many an immature reader. It is the main criticism levelled at the work here on Goodreads. But I think it is really worth sticking with because there is some true wisdom in its pages. And I'd like to end my review by quoting a little bit more of it: \u201cThere can be no black melancholy in him who lives in the midst of nature.\" __________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________.", "Haha....2nd time reading this?

Although I do recommend reading it over several months because there is so much to take in if you like to noodle on your thoughts. Here is my more in-depth review: https://youtu.be/fkX7-Ifu0cEIn the mid-1800's on July 4th, Henry David Thoreau goes into the woods to live alone in a very small cabin along the shores of Walden Pond. This book was written during his two years and two months in this cabin. He questions ideas and he questions the constant need for more, more, more. What is true wealth? What does it mean to be rich? Do we take time to enjoy the things around us?He does provide some VERY detailed descriptions of nature which can be boring from time to time. However, he is providing us the sounds, smells, and sights of 1845. What will the world be like 175 years from now? Additionally, I like to focus on the words of Thoreau and try to imagine the birds chirping and hearing the wind wrestle the leaves through the strands of grass as light shimmers through the branches of trees. It is essentially yoga for your mind. Pick this book up and sip it like a fine wine. Relax and enjoy the small things in life.Connect With Me!Twitter: https://twitter.com/Lisa_of_TroyYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmS...Facebook: https://facebook.com/LisaofTroyEmail: hello@lisaoftroy.com.", "If you find yourself having difficulty sleeping, this book is a fantastic cure for insomnia.

Sorry I borrowed these words from comments about another review, a good friend, not stealing though, these are my own scribbles, repeating the impressions here. Henry David Thoreau a native of Concord, Massachusetts, a pencil maker, the family business which financed his expensive Harvard education and published the at first neglected books. A disciple of Ralph Waldo Emerson and at his urging in 1845, built a log cabin that he lived in for two years on the shore of Walden Pond ( it was his friend's land). Thoreau first day the 4th of July a good omen, future generations will be greatly influenced by his writings \"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation\", \" Perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer\", \" All good things are wild, and free\". The beauty of the lake, its peacefulness, the surrounding forest, plants, animals, birds in the sky , fish in the water all contribute to the enchanting magic, such thoughts by Mr. Thoreau were formed in a large part by his stay in paradise here. Curiosity his greatest strength and worse enemy, fellow citizens considered the unconventional person odd and maybe unhinged. However the gentleman by himself erected a very comfortable home, small but cozy, kept him warm in the winter and cool in summer, and during the very heavy , fearsome, rather frightening to say the least,  rains storms... not a drop fell inside; even keeping furniture dry for his modest needs. In the frigid winter when the pond freezes he walks to the middle and measures its depth by dropping a rock tied to a string after punching a hole in the ice...102 feet deep . He was never lonely, friends and acquaintances frequently came to see the strange man to his annoyance, too much, he felt happiest alone looking at the blue and sometimes green lake always changing color. Viewing a hawk in the air diving and rising, repeatedly just joyful to be alive, this was what he believed also, nature is glorious, nothing better on Earth. A solitary figure looms,  inside a little boat floating on the water's surface, contended, not caring if he Thoreau caught any fish, watching hour after hour dazzling birds on trees, animals searching for food some put outside by him for them to eat, observing the wild untamed creatures, writing down their habits , on paper, fascinated. Nonetheless a newfangled contraption, a train roars nearby, so-called civilization creeps closer. This book celebrates the magnificence of the world, and man's destroying its beauty, this must not occur, prevent this crime and preserve nature, Mr. Thoreau believes and the Legend began with a single man in the woods...Still people want to make money, they will try by any means to do, the constant dilemma...beauty or profit? An important work for those interested and should be read. Besides Henry David Thoreau was a fine writer and terrific onlooker...who preferred to sniff a flower, than stomping on it..", "Life in the Woods = Walden, Henry David ThoreauWalden is a book by Henry David Thoreau, First published in 1854.

I admired what seemed to be his unique courage and absolute integrity. He inspired me to want to \"live deliberately,\" but I knew that a solitary life in a cabin was beyond my abilities. His will seemed so much more resolute than anything I could ever be capable of.That was a couple of decades ago. What struck on this latest recent reading is just how much this is a young man's book. The voice is that of an idealist, a passionate and lonely misfit who longs for a better way to live and for more authentic relationships with others as well as with himself. I know now that Thoreau lived more like an energetic slacker than a true renunciate. He was too principled to work as a schoolmaster (he refused to beat his charges), and there wasn't much he cared to do apart from reading, writing, and observing nature closely. He didn't have a family to take care of, and his parents were indulgent of his wishes. His life at Walden was bracing, but it wasn't filled with hardships. His cabin was just a short walk from Concord, and Thoreau went home for Sunday dinners and stayed at the Emersons' place when it got too cold. His folks took care of his laundry. His life of simplicity was strictly voluntary, and he had numerous safety nets. While these facts make Henry David a bit less intimidating, they also make him more recognizable as a human being. I like this young man, with his snobbery and his idealism, but I know that as a flesh-and-blood person he would have been hard to get to know, and even harder to love. He was probably afraid of intimacy, and even more afraid of failing to live up to his exacting standards. Thoreau was fascinated with purity. His disgust for \"brute\" appetites is something that we now think we understand as related to a fear of sexuality. He was deeply interested in Hindu dietary laws, and had an aversion to all forms of consumption. For him, the ideal was to become so pure that a few drops of nectar would be sufficient sustenance. Like Thoreau, I'm an ethical vegetarian, so I understand somewhat that urge toward purity. But my appetites are huge, and my life is in many ways a big, sloppy, comfortable mess. In contrast, Thoreau wanted to be free of all social constraints, free of the taint of commerce, free to be \"wild.\" But his vision of wildness was of a clean, solitary life. He didn't want to merge or mingle with anything or anyone. The descriptions of Walden and the surrounding landscapes are sublime. They will never get stale, and I enjoy them even more now that I live a few miles from Concord and have visited the pond in different seasons. I look forward to reading this beautiful book again in a few years. I wonder what I'll notice next time?.", "Poetic prose or prosaic poetry? Either way a beautiful work.

I wonder if he had second thoughts about the whole idea; although when he began it was July, and July is a good month to be outdoors, whatever the weather.

I wonder if he had second thoughts about the whole idea; although when he began it was July, and July is a good month to be outdoors, whatever the weather. The man, and what he did and how he lived and what he lived for have always been a source of inspiration to me, and to many others... Walden is much more than one man's account of the years he spent in the woods communing with nature; it is a statement of defiance. Thoreau was educated at Harvard, and spent some time as a teacher where he despaired of the idea of classroom learning. He had a great respect for the Native Americans, admiring their hardiness and skill. He couldn't understand why people thought of them as inferior. To him, they were wise and strong and more in tune with reality than the farmer with his insulated life. He loved wisdom, and spoke of an enlightened society based on compassion and simplicity. He did not align himself explicitly with any religious view...he was a philosophical person. Solitude was what he valued, not just because he was a thinker, but also because he believed it made you a better person, a more independent mind. These ideas, and the kind of existence they represent, are important for me because I think that we're losing something very crucial...not just in the physical loss of the natural environment, but also in the spiritual environment, which is reliant upon it. If it was obvious 150 years ago, it is now the de facto reality, and the question is: what will it be like 150 years from now?So...what are we supposed to do about it? You can see how huge the problem is: global warming, overpopulation, poverty, corporate hegemony... You look at it all, and it floors you; you can't see the edges of it because it's all around you, everywhere. It's just how things are...it's what you're used to seeing. And it's horrible, but that's also accepted to a certain degree...the wrongness of it is tolerated because people feel powerless, or bogged down, or maybe they're just tired of trying...all valid points and very understandable ones. I think Henry would look at it as a consequence of a compulsively complicated culture, and once you look at the massiveness of what we have done, the sheer size of our footprint, maybe you can see it too. Going to the woods ain't gonna cut it... But for the people who feel the way Henry felt, who see what he saw in the deep waters of Walden Pond, the option of inaction is no option at all. The real power of his words is in the actions of those they inspire...the good people doing the hard work of trying to make this culture a less complicated one, and maybe they'll succeed and maybe they won't...the value is in the attempt.It begins with an idea; ideas are the seeds of change, they are what our culture rests upon. But, like a seed, they will become nothing without the proper attention and care. The best one's change the world, the worst one's bring the world to it's knees...which is where we are now. Is it a good idea to continue polluting the planet when we know that it will kill us in the end? No, but that continues. Is it a good idea to pamper the wealthy and tax the poor? No, but that continues. People see these things and forget about Walden Pond because it seems small and ineffectual. It says something about the spirit of a society when the best ideas are purposefully abandoned for shiny, complicated, bad one's. But the people who benefit most from the bad ideas are the people who are effectively running the show. And so they dress them up and give them interesting titles and wrap them in exciting packages and peddle them as good one's. Henry built his home with the trees he took from the forest surrounding the pond at Walden. He built it with tools he borrowed from his neighbors, in good faith, and used recycled materials for what he couldn't get from the woods. It was a good house and it kept him warm in the winter, cool in the summer and dry when it rained. The great wisdom of his life was in how he lived it, with care and appreciation and respect for what was in his environment. Is it a good idea to live as a student, no matter your age? Yes, and also to be a teacher of good ideas, as Henry was.Thoreau stayed at Walden Pond for two years, wrote extensively in his journal, then left. He could have stayed, I suppose, but solitude is not something which benefits forever. I think he says as much, though I'm not sure. He stayed long enough to learn what he needed to, then he moved on. There is wisdom in that, too. Take what you need and leave the rest. Things are changing, despite how it seems sometimes. People are angry. They're tired of being scared. Maybe they won't go to the woods; maybe that's not even an option anymore. The \"woods\" now are more a state of mind, a world view. Whatever happens, Walden will be there, as full of good ideas as it ever was...because a truly good idea will always be good, no matter what the censors say..", "Walden is indeed a somewhat atypical and indefinable book: between autobiography, philosophy and poetry, Thoreau tackles very varied themes in the account of his original \u201cexperience\u201d of life.

I grew up around people like this in Western Mass - people who were really running small farms, building their own shit, forging their own ways - hippies with skills, as opposed to the groovy kind. They're a terrific sort of people. Doing the stuff of life yourself is great.And I've always loved that most famous quote, \"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\" No matter what's going on for me, it makes me feel good. When things aren't going well, it makes me feel less alone. When things are going great it makes me feel smugly superior, and that's nice too.I heart introvertsI liked parts of the Solitude chapter. Everyone's probably heard this quote:To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.But here's a passage I like even more:We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day,and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war.Ha...\"give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are.\" Awesome.And he doesn't fuck aroundMy edition includes On Civil Disobedience, wherein Thoreau - who, as you may know, went to jail for refusing to pay his taxes in protest of the criminal Mexican War - does some pretty fire and brimstone shit:When a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, and subjected to military laws, I think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty so much more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading army...Even voting for the right is doing nothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men.Kinda makes you feel like a wiener, still complaining about Al Gore, right? Thoreau was a badass.But he's sortof obnoxiousI think one thing that bugs me is, he's constantly banging on about how easy life would be if everyone just did like he did. And partly, as he says himself, that's because he \"simplifies\" - he gives up almost every luxury, so it's much easier to meet his needs. I don't think he even has the internet, so that alone saves him like $40 a month. But partly it strikes me as dishonest.There's a smugness about Walden that puts me off. It's particularly grating in the Baker Farm chapter, where he lectures a poor guy with a wife and three kids about how much easier life would be if they just did it Thoreau's way. And I was like a) what if this dude thinks his kids should eat anything besides beans? and b) if you get cold you just go to your mom's house for the weekend, so your whole shtick is a little bit disingenuous, homie. Thoreau has a big safety net. Even the land he's living on is borrowed from Emerson. The poor Irish guy has no such advantages.There may be a reason for his weirdness. My book club got in a long and interesting discussion of whether Thoreau may have had Asperger's Syndrome. More on that here and here, and if you Google \"Thoreau Asperger's\" you'll find plenty more. There's even a whole book called Writers on the Spectrum: How Autism and Asperger Syndrome Have Influenced Literary Writing that throws in Dickinson, Yeats and Melville for good measure. I don't consider myself qualified to have an opinion about this, but it's a fun thing to bring up at your next dinner party.And he's pretty long-windedI mean, at one point towards the end he goes on for like five pages about sand. \"I feel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe, for this sandy overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body.\" Whaaaat the fuck, Thoreau, shut up.So it's tough to know what to make of this book.I rarely enjoyed reading it, but I underlined like half of it. (Okay, sometimes it was just so I wouldn't forget what an asshole he is.) He's often right, but always annoying. There's a lot going on here, and much of it is worthwhile, but I can't exactly recommend it to you, because I doubt you'll like it. I didn't. I respected it. But I didn't like it..", "I love Thoreau's ideals.

Back then I looked upon this book and its ethos as a rallying banner for people who gave a shit about Mother Earth.Given a bit of reflection after a more recent reread, I feel like there's a hitch in Thoreau's practical theory. I mean, he went out there and survived in a cabin in the woods for a couple years and then wrote a book saying that everyone is capable of doing the same, and he got a little uppity about the people who did not. However, with no one else to care for but himself, Thoreau's wilderness trials weren't the same as what they'd be if you had to do this your whole life with no reprieve and a family in tow. Plus, even though it was a rougher landscape back then, spending a little time in the rural Massachusetts suburbs doesn't cut it, imo. Heck, even back then he could have hopped a train passing on the tracks adjacent to the pond and been back in Boston within the hour. However, that doesn't wholly detract from my warm fuzzy feelings for Walden and what it stands for..", "Book ReviewWalden, an American classic...few of us have likely read all 350+ pages, unless you were an English major.

Instead, I had only read excerpts that were included in a literature anthology. While a lot of this book's famous quotes come from early chapters, to fully appreciate Walden you need to read the whole text. Besides his thoughts about trying to live a more meaningful and deliberate life, there are some beautiful descriptions of the woods where he lived, and the reader really gets a sense of what life was like near Walden pond back in 1845. (The book wasn't published until 1854, but Thoreau's experiment started years earlier.) \"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.\"I've been interested in simplicity and mindfulness for years now, and it felt good to revisit this seminal work. While reading, I was struck by how relevant Thoreau's themes were, despite having been written before the American Civil War. For example, he mentions his concern that so many clothes are being made by factories and the problem of underpaid workers and overpaid corporate bosses -- still a problem today. He talks about people relying too much on meat for their meals-- still a problem, and a habit that isn't environmentally sustainable. Most importantly, Thoreau meditates on how people fritter away their lives on pursuits that aren't meaningful -- definitely still a problem, and now it's magnified a hundredfold thanks to the easy distraction of smartphones. The modern Thoreau might write, \"I put away my phone because I wanted to live deliberately; I didn't want to live my life through a screen.\" I read a gorgeous edition of this book that included photographs of Walden Woods by Scot Miller. Seeing the beautiful pictures added a sense of place to my reading, and made it even more meaningful. I highly recommended Walden to anyone interested in mindfulness, simplicity or nature writing.Favorite Quotes[from the Introduction by Edward O. Wilson] \"Wildness is precious because it persists independently of humanity; it fulfills us but does not need us, and all we can do is choose whether to preserve it or destroy it. Nature is a refuge and an anchor, not an alien world, because it is the birthplace and cradle of the human species.\"\"I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of.\"\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"\"It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof.\"\"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrences to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor.\"\"I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.\"\"I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which mean may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that the corporations may be enriched.\"\"And when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the poorer for it, and it be the house that has got him.\"\"There is some of the same fitness in a man's building his own house that there is in a bird's building its own nest. Who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so engaged? ... Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter?\"\"In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one's self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live simply and wisely.\"\"We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep.\"\"Our life is frittered away by detail ... Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!\"\"I am sure I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter -- we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea.\"\"Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry -- determined to make a day of it.\"\"To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem.\"\"A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at once intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself.\"\"I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself was become my amusement never ceased to be novel. It was a drama of many scenes and without an end ... Follow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour.\"\"What sort of space is that which separates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary? I have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another.\"\"Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other ... We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war.\"\"I am convinced, that if all men were to live as simply as I then did, thieving and robbery would be unknown.\"\"If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal -- that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself.\"\"Our whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant's truce between virtue and vice.\"\"Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.\"\"Our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of wildness.\"\"Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.\"\"Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board.\".", "FIVE EXPANSIVE BOOKS SET IN CLOSE QUARTERS (#4)This summer, the Wall Street Journal asked me to pick five books I admired that were somehow reminiscent of A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW.

To that end, I wrote on five works in which the action is confined to a small space, but in which the reader somehow experiences the world. Here is #4:Ironically, one of the most timely pieces of close-quarters literature is a work written over 150 years ago in which the author voluntarily commits himself to a one-room cabin on the outskirts of town. In Walden Henry David Thoreau isolates himself in the woods to avoid the distractions of \u2018modern life\u2019 such as the headlines of newspapers, the gossip of neighbors, and the endless desire for possessions. What he finds in his isolation is not a cessation of life, but a bounding of the spirit. By dampening the insistent noise of the town, he frees himself to dwell on nature, poetry, mythology, philosophy or, in a word, eternity. If Thoreau shook his head with dismay at the distractions in Concord circa 1850, imagine what he would think of our world today! With a 24-hour news cycle, voracious social networks, and vast libraries of entertainment downloadable in the instant, there has never been greater merit in retreating from daily life, if even for an hour. But if reading Walden from end-to-end is not your cup of tea, fear not. Reading a few pages of the book at random can provide the perfect antidote to a hectic day..", "I had high hopes for this book written by a self-imposed hermit living in the woods.

I begin reading Walden again, and there's just something about it that resonates from another time, another place, and another writer.Thoreau's conceit can certainly be provocative, but I think he wants that to be exactly the case for his readers; he's mourning the interaction of souls as modernity encroaches upon both the physical landscape and the landscape of the mind. Living in the woods, facing himself and nature on a equal foothold can be a daunting task, but Thoreau writes about it and makes it so much a part of himself. He wants to be heard within the deepest regions of our souls. Walden is a spiritual work about our world and ourselves, and our failure to connect the two.At least Thoreau tried, and Walden shines in that attempt..", "If I hadn't been reading this for class and skim reading it at 4 AM in a panic to find lines to talk about during class, this would definitely be five stars.

With these Walden-washed eyes and ears I\u2019ve discovered a new joy in reading, in just being and in knowing how much does not depend on me. The author has shared a perspective on the variations of visitors, bird songs and the true value of solitude. Thoreau\u2019s meditations draw me into memories of playing hooky on warm sunny days ... or maybe just dreams of doing so. He describes scenes, little furry creatures and the battlefields of ants, and in the next breath philosophizes about Time and Nature. His rules on culinary simplicity would send Julia Child into apoplexy! While the romantic side of my nature is drawn to his loaf of crusty bread and cold spring water, I don\u2019t think I could long adhere to his monk-like menu of no coffee, tea, wine or meat. Thoreau can wander from one topic to another and back again, frequently seeming off track and irrelevant except that I suspect he might claim relevancy is overrated and not relevant itself. As such, chapter titles are misleading, topics overlapping and meandering, some portions being better than others. And yet\u2014for me at least\u2014even the chapters with uninteresting titles contain quiet little gems of delight. Reading Walden is often like a long visit with an old friend, old as in age and old as in known for a long time. Because this relationship is both deep and durable, you anticipate lengthy visits without fixed agendas, and yet the unpredictable quirkiness of the shared conversation is its greatest recommendation.Thoreau was the original naturalist, environmentalist and proponent of the motto, \u2018Live simply so that others may simply live.\u2019 He was a poet, philosopher, dreamer and observer of life. He was all these things but I think mostly he was someone who wanted to drink life to the very last drop\u2014in the very best sense.I read and listened to most chapters of this book, returning to favorites even three times. Gord Mackenzie did a superb job reading this for LibriVox, making me feel as if Mr. Thoreau was addressing me in person.

Structuring the space required to create dreams into reality. There\u2019s no secret. Just acceptance of resources. Using what the world provides from God to design a way to live philanthropically. Give myself wholly to what I\u2019m doing. Never absent from the present moment. Focusing on what today offers. Traveling here. Home. The place exists within.

An obsession with its own incontrovertible and eventual void. Death.Rilke spent some time during 1902 -03 in Paris, when he was in his late twenties, during which he dedicated himself to writing about art. He wrote on Rodin with whom he became quite close. May be his interest in the materiality of matter originates there. He also studied C\u00e9zanne who was at the end of his days, and left a series of letters on his paintings, still revered by contemporary art historians and which I plan to be my next Rilke read Briefe \u00fcber Cezanne.He also started this fictional diary, supposedly written by a character called Malte Laurids Brigge, whose name we don\u2019t get to know until about a full third into the book, although even then his identity remains elusive, and who, perhaps not coincidentally, has the same age as Rilke was when writing it. This work he did not finish until about 1908 while he was in Rome and was published in Paris when he returned, in 1910.This is the only novel Rilke wrote. But it is not a novel really; he called it Prosabuch. As a series of poetic vignettes it has to be read slowly. With an interrupted reading one can deal better with the fragmentation in the inner narrative. It helps not to try and impose a linear development, for the vignettes (around seventy of them), are loosely connected by what at best could be understood as a personal recollections. A diary of observations, not of happenings.So, this fl\u00e2neur of the mind offers us visits to the streets of Paris, its libraries, and horrid hospitals, and we become lookers like him with a full range: myopia and hyperopia. Or he invites us to the opposite of urban existence: the mansion and gardens of his childhood in which we no longer know who is a ghost or who is a specter in his mind. And these the views of recollection are visually compressed.Oppositions help in delineating meaning. And so as well as city-countryside, we see more of these that function like poles from which this tenuous non-narrative hangs. Seeing and blindness, love and loneliness, poverty and wealth, health and diseases, and most clearly of all, life and death.But for me the most captivating parts were those in which the fl\u00e2neur of aesthetics stays well alive, and tunes his senses for the discovery of art, whether this is his own writing--his quest in the search of poetry, or the magic contained in, for example, a cycle of tapestries--where he finds this sought poetry.The way he beholds the Dame \u00e0 la Licorne series is unsurpassed..", "I adore this odd novel (I read the new Vilain translation) - as weird and wild as I've read, brilliantly anticipatory of later developments in modernism, teeming with ghosts and the unwell, intensely neurotic, (of course) poetic.

The book is a compilation of narrative, philosophical asides, sketches for future poems, and detailed descriptions of artwork. It is clear that the writer is a poet, for much of the content does not make sense except in an irrational way. As every selection in the book shows, he prefers to sit in the corner with his notebook making observations about those around him or delving into his reminiscences from home, never getting up and actually entering into the reality of life. Those who need a clear plot and a reliable narrator beware. This book is non-linear and reads more like poetry than a traditional novel. Or even as a diary. The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge is a challenging novel, as there is no storyline, nor plot structure. Instead, this the notes in this novel deliver an cryptic poetic message.  I can see ones point when claiming they do not understand why there is German words in this novel, despite it being translated. When reading, just like everyone else, I\u2019m garbling the pronunciation, but it doesn't matter. I like the sounds. And not only the sounds, I enjoy the anticipation, the holding-my-breath quality of knowing that the English words sit right there, across the gutter of the page. The fact that the translator did not take all of Rilke's words and water them down, but instead leaves them there for the readers to witness Rilke's real words and beauty, makes the novel that much better. I just started reading this novel, and I can say with merriment that I'm extremely drawn in by the compelled beauty in which Rilke delivers. This novel is truly amazing, as I see it as nothing less.

At times the narrator mused on love and the difference between how men and women love leading me to think several times to myself 'what a load of old bollocks'(view spoiler)[ a curious vernacular expression now that I come to think of it (hide spoiler)] - this I hasten to assure the gentle reader is not my typical response to the books which pass through my hands. Perhaps we can take it as read that I was something less than delighted by Rilke's demi/semi - novel. However, at the same time, I am not entirely unappreciative of it.Well so far I have talked around it, so let me beat the bush directly for a change. The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge are ostensibly written by the eponymous Malte Laurids Brigge, a Dane from a downwardly mobile Danish aristocratic family. The note books open on the 11th of September, presumably sometime around 1910 when Rilke published the work. Brigge is in Paris, he seems to be poor (view spoiler)[ he is the kind of poor that can afford to store his old furniture in a barn and knock about in Paris with no apparent income  (hide spoiler)] but has a wish not to be identified as one of the Parisian urban poor, the opening pages are an intense rush of sensory impressions - mostly unpleasant, Brigge is particularly aware of hospitals, of one of which he describes as \"a factory production line, of course, and with such an immense output the quality of individual deaths may vary\" (p.5) generally people don't think of hospitals as death factories, so Brigge struck me as a person who had either recovered from a severe disease or was particularly obsessed by death (it emerges that the latter is the case). Brigge says some striking things - that he is learning to see, that as he changes he is not the same person as he was, therefore he cannot write to people that he knew because they have now become strangers to each other, and that people wear different faces. A doctor offers him the opportunity to undergo electric shock treatment but while waiting his turn Brigge runs off.This is all mysterious and written densely creating an intense impression, several times I had to go back and read a paragraph again, which didn't particularly help. After a while the narration changes and he recounts events from his childhood, the death of his mother, later of his father, people on the verge of dying, a ghost, his sudden turn to reading, making visits. I didn't have much of a sense of how the young Brigge connected to the older one in Paris - apart from the stress on deaths, or why he went to Paris. Towards the end the narrative shifts back to Paris - how he can hear the neighbours through the walls, ruminations on love, God features throughout but I felt as a synonym for love rather than a set of specific beliefs.Obviously at a loss, I was obliged to make recourse to a popular on-line encyclopeadia to see if anything there might throw some light on what I had read. There the Notebooks were described as semi-autobiographical so maybe we have a game - the author saying this is me and this is not me - indeed some elements in the novel apparently were drawn from his own life, but we also have a distancing the author is asserting that Brigge is a fiction, perhaps a person he could have been but one who he is not, Rilke was from Prague not Denmark and his parents middle class not aristocrats. Rilke started work on the Notebooks when he was in Paris busy as a Rodin super-fan, I had read his essay on Rodin (and maybe I still have that book somewhere packaged away) it was as far as I can remember a completely different work, exuberant and passionate about Rodin's creativity. These notebooks just sit there - obviously enough, there is no plot, nor a sense as in a diary of entering into someone's life, nothing for me congealed into a creative unity or understanding of Brigge/Rilke - but then as I have to remind myself why would it? It says it is the notebooks of Brigge, not the manifesto of Brigge, I assume the reader has a sympathetic grasp of them or does not (as in my case).The infamous encyclopeadia also mentioned that after a favourable reaction to the Bolshevik revolution and the (short lived) Bavarian Soviet he ended up writing private letters in which he praised Mussolini, shortly afterwards and coincidentally he died fortunately before he became a fully fledged Fascist - if I was to read these notebooks as an anti-bourgeosis, anti-capitalist, escape from the Weberian iron cage of modernity, full of longing for a mystification of the rational world then Fascism would have been a logical endpoint as it did offer a mystification of the rational world and transformed the fear of death into the idealisation of death (mostly of other people admittedly). There is in his musings on God a sense that he had been bitten deeply by religion in childhood and retained an emotional need for it while intellectually it no longer satisfied him, others particularly perhaps of Protestant inclinations would lean towards spiritualism, the occult, and palm reading (I am thinking of W.B. Yeats, possibly unjustly).Anyway I am bemused and adrift having finished The Notebooks, there is some intense writing but for me it doesn't come together other than to imagine that Brigge might have been an artist but wasn't and that he was not in a good state of mind, being alone in Paris showed no signs of agreeing with him at all. On the plus side at least he did not start murdering prostitutes (view spoiler)[ which at one stage did look as though it might be a possibility (hide spoiler)].It may be that it suffers in translation and losses a certain lyricism, it is the kind of book in which I can imagine that the music of the language carries the reader, but not in this translation to this reader..", "I don\u2019t imagine that I will always read.

With books, I can pick and choose a sensibility, an outlook, that chimes with my own and I can guarantee company and conversation that I don\u2019t find alienating or dispiriting. To this end, I have read The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge three times. As a novel it is something of a failure, but large parts of it resonate with me as much as, if not more than, any writing ever set down on paper.\u201cMy last hope was always the window. I imagined that outside there, there still might be something that belonged to me, even now, even in this sudden poverty of dying. But scarcely had I looked thither when I wished the window had been barricaded, blocked up, like the wall. For now I knew that things were going on out there in the same indifferent way, that out there, too, there was nothing but my loneliness.\u201dThe Notebooks is essentially the thoughts, memories and impressions of Malte, a twenty-eight year old Dane who has recently moved to Paris. There are a number of well-known but now dated novels that deal with the ex-pat experience, such as Cortazar\u2019s Hopscotch and Miller\u2019s Tropic of Cancer, novels that are invariably marred by machismo and pretension. The Notebooks, however, contains none of that. Rilke\u2019s Paris isn\u2019t a playboy\u2019s playground, littered with booze and whores; it is a \u2018great\u2019 city, full of \u2018curious temptations,\u2019 but there is nothing glamorous about it and no sense that Malte is living some kind of mock-heroic existence. Indeed, in the opening line of the novel he states that Paris is a place where, it strikes him, one does not go to live, but where one goes to die; it is a place that smells of pommes frites and fear.That Malte is the last, or one of the last, in his family line is trebly significant, for he is preoccupied with death, with solitude, and with nostalgia. One notices that, again in contrast with many other similar novels, there is not one living character with whom he regularly engages or communicates. In Paris he is an observer, making notes about ordinary citizens, but never interacting with them. For example, he sees a pregnant woman \u2018inching ponderously along by a high, sun-warmed wall\u2019 as though \u2018seeking assurance that it was still there,\u2019 he watches a man collapse, and then another who has some kind of physical ailment that causes him to hop and jerk suddenly. He appears to be drawn to the eccentric and lost, the suffering and down-trodden, no doubt because he identifies with them, but he remains alone and isolated himself. Towards the end of the novel he states that he once felt a loneliness of such enormity that his heart was not equal to it.However, when he is surrounded by people, such as when there is a carnival, he describes it as a \u2018vicious tide of humanity\u2019 and notes how laughter oozes from their mouths like pus from a wound. Malte is the kind of man who lives mostly in his head who, although he encourages his solitude, is scared of losing his connection with the world, of withdrawing and parting from it. At one point he goes to the library, and praises it as a place where people are so engrossed in their reading that they barely acknowledge each other. He spends his time strolling to little shops, book dealers and antique places, that, he says, no one ever visits. Once more, we see an interest in obscure things, in things that have been forgotten or neglected. One of my favourite passages is when he comes upon a torn down building, and he states that it is the bit that is left that interests him, the last remaining wall with little bits of floor still visible. It is the suggestion of something once whole, once fully functioning that grabs his attention.[Rainer Maria Rilke \u2013 left \u2013 and Auguste Rodin in Paris]As noted, much of the book is concerned with Malte\u2019s memories regarding his family, specifically in relation to his childhood. One understands how this \u2013 his upbringing and family situation \u2013 may have gone some way to making him the man he is. He is taciturn, he says, and then notes how his father was too. His father was not fond of physical affection either. Later, in one of the more autobiographical anecdotes, Malte talks about his mother\u2019s mourning for a dead child, a little girl, and how he would pretend to be Sophie [the name of Rilke\u2019s own mother] in an effort to please her. It is therefore not a surprise that he is highly sensitive, inward-looking and ill at ease with himself. Indeed, there is much in The Notebooks about identity and individuality. There are, Malte says, no plurals, there is no women, only singularities; he baulks at the term family, saying that the four people under this umbrella did not belong together. Furthermore, at one stage he fools around, dressing up in different costumes, in which he feels more himself, not less; but then he tries on a mask and has some kind of emotional breakdown.All of these things \u2013 ruins, obscurity, deformity, ailments, nostalgia, the self, loneliness \u2013 come together in what is the book\u2019s dominant theme, which is that of death. Only Tolstoy\u2019s Ivan Ilych and Lampedusa\u2019s The Leopard contain as much heartrending insight into the subject. There are numerous passages and quotes I could discuss or lift from the text, but, not wanting to ruin your own reading, I will focus on only one. When writing about individuality, Malte bemoans the fact, as he sees it, that people do not die their own deaths anymore, they die the death of their illness, they become their illness and their passing, therefore, has nothing to do with them. In sanatoriums, he continues, people die \u2018so readily and with much gratitude\u2019; the upper classes die a genteel death at home, and the lower-classes are simply happy to find a death that \u2018more or less fits.\u2019\u201cWho is there today who still cares about a well-finished death? No one. Even the rich, who could after all afford this luxury, are beginning to grow lazy and indifferent; the desire to have a death of one\u2019s own is becoming more and more rare. In a short time it will be as rare as a life of one\u2019s own.\u201dMalte contrasts these predictable, unheroic deaths with that of his uncle, Chamberlain Christoph Detlev Brigge. The old Chamberlain died extravagantly; his death was so huge that new wings of the house ought to have been built to accommodate it. He shouted and made demands, demands to see people \u2013 both living and dead \u2013 and demands to die. This voice plagued the locals, keeping them in a state of agitation; it was a voice louder than the church bells\u2026it was the voice of death, not of Christoph, and it became the master, a more terrible master than the Chamberlain had ever been himself. The point that Malte is making seems to be that one should not go gentle into that good night, that one should not accept the death that most pleases others, that causes the least amount of fuss. You will die, there is no escape, it is within you, your death, from the very first moment, you carry it with you at all times, but you do not have to go out with a whimper.I wrote at the beginning of this review that The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge is a failure as a novel and this probably warrants further explanation. Rather like Pessoa\u2019s The Book of Disquiet, which it resembles in many ways actually, I imagine that some readers will find it difficult to read the book cover-to-cover. There is absolutely no plot, and many of the entries do not follow on from the previous one. Moreover, after a few pages about Paris, which I would guess serve to draw in a number of people, the focus abruptly shifts, and the book then becomes increasingly strange and elusive, with a relentless interiority. None of this bothers me, however. While I do hope to give up reading one day, I will, without question, carry this book around inside me for the rest of my life, rather like my death..", "Rilke\u2019s semiautobiographical surrogate Malte Laurids Brigge is a young Dane, a noble scion adrift in early twentieth century Paris, trying to become a poet.

He corresponds rather well to Anthony Burgess\u2019s description, in his charming study ReJoyce (1965), \u201cof the type of student Stephen Daedelus represents, poor, treasuring old books with foxed leaves, independent, unwhining, deaf to political and social shibboleths, fanatically devoted to art and art only.\u201d Malte and Stephen hang out at the Bibliotheque Nationale, worry about how incidents of shabbiness in their wardrobes may effect their dignity, and are nuts about Ibsen (or was that just Joyce himself? Did he lend that admiration of his to Stephen? I\u2019m not near my bookshelves.) Malte doesn\u2019t have anything like Stephen\u2019s confidence in ultimate triumph\u2014like the Camus and Sartre heroes for whom he is said to have provided a model, Malte is pushed pretty hard up against the wall by metaphysical doubts and a general terror before existence. But even so, they both have high-caliber minds that relish the lyrical-gnomic fragment and eschew exposition or transition (in the very best badass tradition of high modernist narration) in the telling of eerie tales from their unhappy childhoods (Malte\u2019s mom is dead, too) and in excursions through their daunting hoards of philosophical and historical arcana (Stephen likes scholastic philosophy; Malte has a thing for famous female anchorites and fanatical mystic nuns, plus, and this is a big one for him, the deathbed agonies of medieval French kings as encountered in Froissart\u2019s Chronicles); and Rilke is -- like Joyce, and like Baudelaire their mutual master in this respect -- profoundly attentive to the crushing squalor and pathos to be glimpsed in the \u201csinuous creases of old capital cities\u201d:Or that time in Naples: that young creature sat there opposite me in the street car and died. At first it looked like a fainting spell; we even drove on for a while. But then there was no doubt that we had to stop. And behind us vehicles halted and piled up, as though there would never be any more moving in that direction. The pale, stout girl might have quietly died like that, leaning against the woman beside her. But her mother would not allow this. She contrived all possible difficulties for her. She disordered her clothes and poured something into her mouth which could no longer retain anything. She rubbed her forehead with a liquid someone had brought, and when the eyes, at that, rolled back a little, she began to shake her to make her gaze come forward again. She shouted into those eyes that heard nothing, she pushed and pulled the whole thing to and fro like a doll, and finally she raised her arm and struck the puffy face with all her might, so that it should not die. That time I was afraid.Rilke\u2019s tableaux parisiens are as uncanny and disturbing as Baudelaire\u2019s. He's as fascinated by the old, the worn-out, the thrown-away, the \"girls, still unused in their innermost depths, who had never been loved\" as the poet of \u201cLes Sept Vieillards\u201d and \u201cLes Petites Vieilles.\u201d On a blind newspaper peddler\u2019s Sunday cravat and new straw hat: \u201cHe himself got no pleasure from them, and who among all these people (I looked about me) could imagine that all this finery was for them?\u201d The wannabe Bohemian girls from good families Malte encounters copying in museums wear dresses that, without servants to button then all the way up, appear half open in the back. Beside him in one of the waiting rooms of the Hospice de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, a last refuge of prostitutes and beggars, aged women and the insane, Malte becomes conscious of a huge, immovable mass, having a face that I saw was empty, quite without features and without memories; and it was gruesome that the clothes were like that of a corpse dressed for a coffin. The narrow, black cravat had been buckled in the same loose, impersonal way around the collar, and the coat showed that it had been put on the will-less body by other hands. The hand had been placed on the trousers exactly where it lay, and even the hair looked as if it had been combed by those women who lay out the dead, and was stiffly arranged, like the hair of stuffed animals.The portions of Malte's family memories and introspection are no less absorbing. Rilke's imagery is often so striking that even the deepest burrowing in Malte's malaise and artistic self-doubt can rival the lurid street scenes. \"I put my little strength together like money.\" \"...but inside you it preciptates, hardens, takes on pointed, geometrical forms between your organs.\" \"...it was a literal, unambiguous tale that destroyed the teeming maggots of my conjectures.\" Certainly the weightiest book I've read this year. .", "*Note: I suggest not to read this book if you are lonely, depressed, unhappy or dissatisfied with your life.To be loved means to be consumed by \ufb01re.

One should never stop making wishes. I do not believe that they come true, but there are wishes that keep, a whole life long, and one couldn't live long enough for them to come true anyway.'In a letter of 18 July 1903 he writes to his friend Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9:'Paris was an experience similar to that of the military school; just as in those days i was seized by an immense, fearful amazement, so now i was beset by horror of everything that is known, as if in some inexpressible confusion, as life.'Malte suffers from rootlessness. He is afraid of death, but he is also afraid to be loved by others. Any kind of affection is unnerving. He seeks only one love and that is the love of God. But is he ready to accept that bliss?The woman who loves always surpasses the man who is loved, because life is greater than fate. Her devotion aspires to be infinite: that is her happiness. But the nameless grief of her love has always been this: that she is required to limit that devotion..", "Let\u2019s make one thing clear here: this is described everywhere as Rilke\u2019s only novel, but I would never have called this book a novel.

Thank goodness goodreads allows so much space for someone to move beyond a simplistic star rating and to give lengthy descriptions of the different aspects of the books that reached him (as well as provide rambling prefatory notes).  *I didn\u2019t like reading this. I never found myself anxiously awaiting the next time I could find time to pick it up and read more about Malte\u2019s childhood reminiscences. I waded through his obscure historical asides, couldn\u2019t keep any of the names straight, and just didn\u2019t care. I actually cringed at certain passages which I thought were striving so hard to achieve profundity and reached odd at best. For example, when Malte \u201chit upon the idea of offering [the neighbor on the other side of the wall] my will. For one day I understood that his was at an end. And after that, whenever I felt it coming on, I stood on my side of the wall and begged him to make use of it. And as far as my expenditure of will was concerned, I began to feel it\u201d (132). To me this reeks of a would-be poet attempting to emphasize how he feels things more deeply than the common man, when, in reality, he\u2019s nuts and it makes no sense. Plus, that page is followed by a page of meditation on a box lid, \u201ca lid [that] could have no other longing than to find itself on its box\u2026the fulfillment of its desires\u201d (134). He even decides \u201cthis box lid has it in for me.\u201d  *Then there are his ruminations on love, death, and God. All fodder for some very profound revelations. However, again I just couldn\u2019t get into them\u2014it\u2019s the same problem I\u2019ve always had with the Transcendentalists, and some of this sounded pretty transcendentalist-ish: \u201cIn the garden, there is one chief thing; everything is everywhere, and one would have to be in everything in order not to miss anything\u201d (149). Malte is definitely trying to live deep and suck out the marrow of life, to separate himself from the mass of men who lead lives of quiet desperation. *HOWEVER, there were many passages that I did find profound, especially towards the beginning. (Maybe this just isn\u2019t the type of book one can read a few pages at a time in ten minute bursts). In the beginning, I understand that Malte does represent the true Modern man: he is \u201clearning to see\u201d (3), discovering that \u201cthe main thing was that one was alive\u201d (2), wondering \u201cIs it possible that the whole history of the world has been misunderstood? Is it possible that the past is false because one has always spoken of its masses\u2026\u201d (16), understanding that \u201csomething is going on in me as well, something that is beginning to distance and separate me from everything\u201d (37). Talk about embodying the disillusionment, isolation, and true severing of ties with the past of the modernist movement (just read page 38 in its entirety and you\u2019ve got a summary of said movement). There is sooo much talk about \u201cmasks\u201d in the book, and I see that as a metaphor for Malte\u2019s goal. He seeks to reveal the Truth to all of those around him, to rip away the false masks under which they live. Unfortunately, he is too awkward (especially around girls) and self-conscious and insecure. There were countless time throughout the text that I wrote in the margins \u201cPrufrock!\u201d In fact, as I read I had planned for this review to be a comparison between this book and the poem. Now I realize that I would have had to copy nearly the entire poem because comparisons/connections can be drawn to nearly every line of it (\u201cNow one accidentally emerges among accidental things and almost takes fright at not being invited\u201d (97)\u2026I mean, come on!).

But would it exist then, would it exist?\u201d (54)\u2026\u201dAnd will they, in any event see what I am saying here\u201d (111).

Brigge is a twenty-eight year old Danish man, alone and adrift in Paris. He wishes to transmute his fear of death into some profound literary work and fills his notebooks with memories, historical anecdote, and sketches of the Parisian streets. I was very moved by Rilke's evocation of urban alienation, of listening to your neighbours through the walls of a cheap rented room because you have no-one to talk to, and of death-obsession. I identified with Brigge's preoccupations, having on occasion been in just the same state of mind myself. On the other hand, towards the end of the book Brigge writes more of love than death, and this made him harder for me to relate to. (This probably doesn't reflect too well on me.) Brigge, a solitary and melancholic figure with no direction in life but periodically overwhelmed by fear of death, seems to be a shadow or echo of Rilke. Perhaps he represents someone Rilke thought he could have been? Brigge is unhappy and there is no indication that he will ever transcend his poverty and perpetual introspection. I can very well understand being afraid of such a lonely trap of a life. In fact, one might subtitle this book, 'The Dangers of Being an Unhappy Introvert in Paris'. During the first third or so I was rather reminded of Plath's 'The Bell Jar'.Rilke's writing is absolutely beautiful, which isn't surprising as he was famous as a poet. In fact, this was his only novel. By way of example, I was struck by this bit about reading:'Somehow I had a premonition of what I so often felt at later times: that you did not have the right to open a single book unless you engaged to read them all. With every line you read, you were breaking off a portion of the world. Before books, the world was intact, and afterwards it might be restored to wholeness once again.' I tend to find poetry intimidating and impossible to understand, but I ought to give Rilke's a chance. 'The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge' suggests I have an affinity with him. No other writer I've come across has articulated the fear of death as effectively. .", "I've read a few German books already this year. So I thought I'd give Rilke a go.

That's not to say I wasn't bowled over, sometimes head over heels, in that interval by books like Moby-Dick, The Brothers Karamazov, or Walter Benjamin's \"Illuminations\", some of which I even prefer over Goethe, but rather what I have to say about them is limited, and often for different reasons. Need I be someone who tells you The Brothers Karamazov is good and worth reading? I will tell you though that this is good and worth reading and something that you might overlook to your own disadvantage. There are some passages that border on superfluity, and perhaps I can't ever consider it in something banal like my \"top 10 favorites\", but my takeaway at least has spawned this entire review, so take that how you will.I in fact recommend you read this before you read Rilke's poems. What could I say about Rilke's poetry? The collection translated by Stephen Mitchell is not one of, is not becoming, but simply is the greatest collection of poetry I have ever read. Sorry aficionados of the French language, but my heart definitely belongs on the German speaking side (I will have to pay my dues eventually however, because if one thing influenced my writing this review, it's the Proust I'm reading right now). Sonnet XIII of the second part of the Sonnets to Orpheus is absurdly moving and, like a flower in a field of ash, a consolation for the whole of life, but in the wrong translation sounds awful. What's great about this book here however is how it sets itself apart from Rilke's poetry. In fact I daresay some of the best sections are the most unlike his poems. There is a certain amount of prosaicness, for lack of a better term, that can only be transferred in prose. And the prose here is really true to life, like a prototype of a lot of stream-of-consciousness literature, and that's one of the few reasons why I think this novel is almost a manifesto for the Modernist movement if there ever was one, much more at least than the distinctly late-Romantic and slightly mystic poetry of Rilke that most people know him for. And one of the greatest strengths of prose is its ability to transmit information, again more like the way we actually think if it's experimented with a little, which is made even stronger if told to you in anecdotes so that you really experience it, have it affect the marrow of your bones, and stick in your mind like that elusive hand in the darkness described in these Notebooks. That's also quite a nice summary of Rilke's theory of writing mature poetry, also elaborated on by Rilke in this book. So there's the answer for the layman about why anyone would write a novel instead of any essay: talented enough, you can do both.To continue a bit on the idea of a \"modernist manifesto\": events in this book occur psychologically. In this case I'm reminded a bit of Joyce's Dubliners, where the events that occur in his stories merely serve to support the psychological transformation of his characters, which can be considered the main events. Here, if any physical events happen at all, they are all in memory or often highlight an observation made earlier or later in the book. There is also an imperceptible change, nearly imperceptible because you only realized it's occurred when you're knee-deep in it, that happens about halfway through the book which can only be inferred upon why Malte Laurids Brigge has changed from his reflective and gloomy demeanor in the first part to something more resembling, lo and behold, Rainer Maria Rilke. All this connects to and is true to life in its recognition of our alienation from it. To those who seek out literature like this, to those who feel drawn to it in any way, Rilke remarks in this book that we've been fated to a life of strange wonder, to seeing things as they are, the reality behind appearances, that we can either flounder and die in this dark forest of Dante's imagination, or to come out of it and, more importantly, tell of what we see. It's obvious that Rilke was influenced by Nietzsche when writing these Notebooks, but he didn't explicitly take it to its logical conclusion; the transformation of the self was already implied therein. If we're to abide to Pound's \"make it new\" thesis no matter the era we're in, then this book somehow feels as new as the day it was written and yet as old as someone looking at the self they once were.Even more important than a good book that can be endlessly explored is one that redirects you back to yourself, to have you explore inside yourself as is what Rilke would have wanted. Perhaps, similar to something Malte observed, what we do with most books is get up from them too early after supposedly \"finishing\" them to all the more hurriedly applaud and hang laurels on the author; otherwise we would have to actually change our lives..", "Rilke was a poet and his only novel demonstrates that on every page. It is a dreamlike novel that is evocative of Paris and poetry. The focus on themes of death and darkness in contrast with the power of god and belief were powerful, joining with his beautiful writing to keep me enthralled. Through Rilke's fascination with faces and appearances the importance of constructing an authentic life is emphasized. This becomes a prerequisite for the prospect of a unique personal death.

Through Rilke's fascination with faces and appearances the importance of constructing an authentic life is emphasized. This becomes a prerequisite for the prospect of a unique personal death. Death itself is a character in the novel, a \"terrible rival\", which may seem stronger than the living in its tolling. While Paris is the city of poetry it is also described as a place \"to die in\".(p 3) More importantly this is an early contribution to the literature of existentialism and bears reading and comparison with Kierkegaard, Gide and Camus. In some respects Rilke appears to be a harbinger of such thinkers as Heidegger and Benjamin with his portents of the looming growth of a modern industrial society. Just as Dostoevsky before him Rilke paints a picture of a world that is being threatened by science and technology. But, you do not have to fixate or even focus on these trends in order to enjoy this novel, you merely need to relax and enjoy the poetically beautiful way Rilke serves up the prose in this haunting story..", "If long meanderings on 13thC French Kings, Danish satirical poets, 12thC popes, or an even longer semi-autobiographical childhood narrative refracted through the histories of Danish aristocrats, or inscrutable abstract meanderings reffed up obscurum per obscurius, padded around frequent shards of poetic Rilkean prose and spellbinding imagery, is something that appeals, step up new reader of this novel.

He was convinced I could have stopped it. It was apparent now that he had always thought too highly of me. And there was no time left to explain. He looked at me, aggrieved and lonely, till it was over.\"A lot of people here are convinced that I am some sort of seasoned reader. It is hardly the case, lots of books I read do nothing for me. And sometimes I feel like giving up on reading altogether but then something like this comes along and tells me why I go to so much trouble. I just have a soft spot for writers like Rilke There is a very much discussed quote in 'The Idiot', where Myshkin says \"Beauty will save the world\". I am sure it is interpreted in lots of ways but I, personally think, that Myshkin was just such a soul. He was extremely troubled by all the cruelties, brutalaties, wrongs and suffering of the world and couldn't come to terms with it. And such sensitive people seem to find far more pleasure in things beautiful (which admittedly, in Myshkin's case, happened to be a hot women) - they must feel somehow redeemed from the bad of the world in that aesthetic experience - Dostovesky himself talked about a kind of ecstasy he felt when having epileptic attacks which made those attacks worthwhile. And this is what I believe Van Gogh must have felt in the asylum night after he had tried to kill himself when he looked out of his window and decided to draw the Starry Sky. Rilke made me feel the very same way as those artists did. He too longed for beautiful things to redeem himself and that is perhaps why he finds them more frequently than most writers. If one could kill oneself with beautiful sentences, I won't mind killing myself with this one:\"Might it not be possible, just for once, to see the sea?\".", "Rilke's extraordinary semi-autobiographical novel deals with masking our true selves and others in order to fit into the bewildering chaos of the world around us.

This being is the neighbor.\"It's also surprisingly coherent, although it doesn't seem that way when you are knee deep in the writer's take on, for example, the story behind certain Danish or English historical figures, or the true driving forces behind the prodigal son's departure and eventual return. Loosely speaking, the novel passes from an intense scrutiny of self, including preoccupations with ghosts, costumes, death, fear, and isolation, to a discussion of the unrevealed psyches of men and women who are the stuff of legends, and ends on an exploration of the joys of unrequited love: To be loved is to perish; to love is to endure. I felt like I was reading the evolving journal of an anxious, perceptive soul - starting with self (as journalists are apt to do), and developing into a more abstract exploration of human nature and ideals.

Thankfully, Stephen Mitchell's rendition is an absolute joy to read, although I can't, given my linguistic shortcomings, confirm the NYRB's claim that it is \"[a]n almost perfect equivalent for the original.\"But as for the \"novel\" itself. Rilke provides the reader not so much with plot as with a series of episodes\u2014these grounded in the experiences and reminiscences of a young Danish nobleman slumming it up in Paris. The eponymous Malte visits the library. Recalls the death of his father. Waits to see the doctor. Loiters among the Parisian destitute and marginalized. Contemplates ghosts, poetry, childhood, gender. In one famous scene, highly admired by Heidegger, he observes, in grotesque detail, a half-demolished building, the traces of its former innards impressed upon the remaining brick wall.One could almost approach The Notebooks as work of philosophy. But Rilke's genius is most evident in his command of imagery and metaphor. Take the following passage, for instance, which continues to haunt me to this day:The street was too empty; its emptiness had gotten bored and pulled my steps out from under my feet and clattered around in them, all over the street, as if they were wooden clogs. The woman sat up, frightened, she pulled out of herself, too quickly, too violently, so that her face was left in her two hands. I could see it lying there: its hollow form. It cost me an indescribable effort to stay with those two hands, not to look at what had been torn out of them. I shuddered to see a face from the inside, but I was much more afraid of that bare flayed head waiting there, faceless.Very much recommended\u2014at least the Mitchell translation..", "A bizarre book but not in the way we might now think of the word - a melange of the shocking or outr\u00e9 or the inconsistent or absurd - rather I mean bizarre because of the impressions we get page by page as Rilke's subject matter flits from three or four principal concerns, shown in three or four historical settings.

(To say this is to impose a more solid structure than is revealed at a first read). The subject matter: As the blurb says, there is death all around, or rather, people carry death within them. There are ghosts. There are medieval Dutch kings. Minor aristocracies are invoked, Malte Laurid Brigge's own family being of no small concern here, shows all above elements at stages (death, the past, minor aristocracies) episodically throughout the book. Then there's the MLB of his modern time, the one stuck in Paris writing these crazy lines. To give specific examples of the various topics herein, we read about Bettina and Goethe, deathmasks, Charles VI of France (1368\u20131422), Swedish king Christian IV (1671-1730), tapestries, Baudelaire and about fifty or more semi-obscure historical figures, writers, artists, aristocracy and nobility I never heard of. Brigge's next door neighbour recites Pushkin out loud in a child's sing-song voice to keep from losing his mind. Recollecting childhood, Brigge recalls how his dog goes nuts one day, leaps at a ghost and then dies. The same ghosts come to sit down at dinner or just amble around deserted galleries and corridors of the family mansion and no one minds. He relates the scene of how two surgeons pierced the heart of his Father after death, to ensure he was dead and in one scene Brigge addresses young women hoping they will call each other the names Sappho called her lovers, before then saying that he hopes that just one of them will meet a guy who tells them these Lesbian names before inviting her back to his demesne to (and this is for real) look at his etchings (of horses, by Riddiger.) Now I know where THAT particular cultural trope might have originated...Hence: bizarre. Regardless of lack of immediate cohesion, or through composed narrative (true to the title the book reads like a Notebook, crazy jottings given flesh and polish,) Rilke's poetics/aesthetics are all here in nascent form, all the more compelling and at times thrilling, because we are seeing their birth pangs, their prosaic nativity before they become reified into the truly poetic, to find their full expression in the famous Elegies that were to come 12 or so years later at castle Duino. Even here one gets the impression that Rilke's actors and world are provisional in status and contingent in their being, and that everything approaches becoming. Story by story, events are threatened by fulfilment: their very sentences are built upon the cusp of change and movement.  This exploration of potential energies, potential stores, potential states and potential full stop, also finds expression, if not apotheosis in another kind of telos. For, like the world of Brigge's grandather, like the gaping wound of a house destroyed between two others, like the realm of Charles VI and the empire of Pope John the 22nd, also mentioned in this book, things also teeter on the edge of death and destruction, a worser kind of change. Together with the ghosts, the kings who look upon their works and despair, the dead poets and Rilke\u2019s roster of women dead of broken hearts, the to-die (not note, the dead, for Brigge's characters are always shown as dying) are never far away from these pages.To take Brigge as a ventriloquism of Rilke (or more precisely, to see Brigge as an Attic mask, a mouthpiece for projection,) there is then, a peculiar kinesis in the book, as there is in all of Rilke, even in the vehicle of mere prosody. A room seen through a doorway ruins the surprise of entering it new to its objects, thus: deflation (where there should be fulfilment). Death lives in his mother and father and Grandfather, and even visits MLB to seek attainment. Thus fulfilment. Yet despite this enantidromy af the aesthetic, the becoming of one thing into its feared opposite, there is at the same time a quest for plenitude \u2013 of self and moment. Rilke's ambition is to literally in-tensify receptivity and perception until it become one transparent privileged moment. In this concern he is perhaps one of the greatest poet of the sublime. He is too, also one of the best explorers of its fundus and opposite, the obverse of the exalted: The Notebook pulses with the threat of entropy and decline and gives us a mirror to see our puniness and our disposability in the face of the World. In Rilke's eyes everything (but the self most of all) has the potential to undermine itself, and also to sustain and \u201cup-build\u201d and edify itself, and our potential is celebrated all the more dithyrambically because all the more fragile. And yet! how powerful when discovered. Little wonder then that Rilke read and found kinship with that other great artist of edification, Soren Kierkegaard.In the main though, I didn't know what to think or what the message or aim of the book was.I don't think there is one. Translator Hulse calls it an anti-novel. Sometimes I was actually bamboozled by Rilke's opacities. Eg entry number 63 which I will quote in full: \"Outwardly, a great deal has changed. I do not know how. But within and before You, Lord, within ourselves and before You who look on, are we not without action? We do discover that we do not know our part; we look for a mirror; we should like to remove our make-up and whatever is false and be real. But somehow a forgotten piece of our disguise still adheres to us; some trace of exaggeration remains in our eyebrows; we do not realise that the corners of our mouths are twisted. And thus we go about, a laughing stock and a demi-being, with neither a real existence nor a part to play-act.\" Here is same concern with becoming, the same focus on our selves, the same question (as in the Elegies) given unto the celestial, the angels, and, this being an earlier Rilke, to God Himself. To paraphrase Nietzsche, how can we become who we are?* Notice we are not demi-gods, but demi-beings, those who have yet to transform, achieve potential \u2013 in corporate language: to become \"self-actualised\". Yet the language this excerpt works in is pretty strange and typical of the book. One has to parse out meaning sometimes, to re-read (or rather, *I* had to!). So: A great deal has changed but he and we do not know how, we just know it is outward change. This is enigma disguised as plain statement, made to highlight again, the omin-potence/science of the celestial our failure at self scrutiny. \"Are we not without action?\" echoes Brigge's Danish compatriot, Hamlet, another sometime player of parts, yet we have neither real existence nor a part. We are existentially stuck, in a different degree to the Danish prince. No Exit? Not quite, we have soteriology. So in the space of a paragraph, Rilke's entire artisitc project comes back again to the fore, and that\u2019s the entire entry number 63. The one previous to this entry, speaks of the afore mentioned popes, kings and death. The one immediately subsequent to it, a walk in an abandoned amphitheatre which reminds one of Valery\u2019s Marine Cemetery before of course, Valery thought of it - which scenario affords Rilke once more his chance for narrative kinesis, to show the mutability of self versus Welt (a classic Rilkean sentence: \"climbing through the ranks of seats, I felt how small I was becoming in this setting\".) As the scene continues he turns round to be confronted by a true picture of the sublime, and as we read, we become conscious that our inner being is held only in check by the membrane of our soul's skin. With Rilke, it can soar, but not in these notebooks. For that, we must go to his true medium, the poem. Granted, Hulse offers us the idea that this is all a prose-poem, but I see it instead as Rilke disengaging from the strictures of verse, to test his legs with prose. As poetic sounding as it is, his concern is not the punctum of the poetic image, but the exploration around it, its expression through a different medium, almost an ascetic exercise to test his powers. Living as he was, a hand-to-mouth existence, with his lodgings changing often, I like to think that his poetic genius (by which I mean it in the sense of the old sense, as a kind of geist) was dissipated, trailing and irresolute. The clamour of the oppressive modernising world, snatches of which we get in the first half of this book, was too loud to let him say what he really means, what he was born to say. As said above, for that, he has to flee to Duino.  Having said all this though, and for all the bizarritude there are moments of beauty (as when he talks of Bettina\u2019s letters to Goethe) and profundity. Very few writers nowadays have the sensibility, patience, learning or intelligence to write like this and I think that's a shame. In prose or poetry, Rilke voice is his own, inimitable and unique. As stated, this book is all the more interesting because that voice emerges strongly, whatever way it is used. I hope this review has shown a little that the Notebook forms a strong stepping stone in Rilke's poetic career. Summary: In The Notebooks we read the words of a very sensitive guy, basically Rilke himself, whose keen awareness of the contingency of the world and of our trembling dormant potentials - as well as our deepest fears - would inform his entire poetic oeuvre. His Notebook perhaps an attempt to press upon our heart, to prick us, and test if we are all still breathing. Later the test becomes to imagine the embrace of an angel. How much distance between that overawing idea, and the germ of it in these notebooks.  As such, I wouldn\u2019t say this is essential reading for someone looking into \u201cclassics\u201d. It takes some concentration in places too, but it is good to use to trace Rilke\u2019s artistic ancestry, and fun for fans to flick through. (Plus it has unicorns.)Newcomers to Rilke should dive straight into his poetry.

That is how I felt reading this book, for better or worse. There's a lot here, but it's more akin to a poetry collection than a novel. I tried to read it as the latter. Next time, I'll approach it as the former, and I imagine it'll be twice as rewarding. .", "\"Why, to the internally self- devouring rubbish heap of literature, which broadcasts its perfumic stench to every period of history: nothing could be less like him (Rimbaud) than the surrealities, the vitreosities of, for example, the late Rilke.\"___Thomas BernhardFrom the very beginning the focus of this book is on death and dying.

Paris hospitals that cleanse and protect us today (and back then) from the awful deaths that are actually amazing to behold in their presence. The long and careful demonstrative death of his paternal grandfather who was supreme master of his estate and who severely demanded much of everyone in his dying throughout the entire ten weeks of his loud death in a castle not even large enough for his awful sounds. And then a visit to his other grandfather after the death of Brigge's mother and the spectral visions accompanying his father's and his visit to another vast and populated home of temporal surprises.Though Rilke is the author, Malte Laurids Brigge is the narrator of this novel. It is to me, from the beginning, a chance for Rilke to express ideas he would not be able to present otherwise. Especially his ideas regarding poetry. Early on Malte Laurids Brigge is describing what poetry means and is for him. I would have to think Rilke knew Brigge was wrong, but he leaves it for the reader to discover for herself. Brigge's theory is that a poet must have lived experiences of a lifetime in order to write good poetry. That it is better to write poetry at the end of ones life than scribble away at words when one is young. That poetry is not feeling but rather forgotten memories that come back to the poet after a long life of shared experiences. I have little doubt that Malte Laurids Brigge believes these words, but I know better than to think Rilke, the poet, himself does. It is obvious the Brigge argument was lost on an artist such as I. There is no time frame for the writing of good and great poetry. It either happens or it does not. A writer's age or lived experience has nothing to do with the writing of great and timeless poetry. It is poppycock to believe otherwise. And I don't mean candied popcorn. The text moves back to a daily reportage of Brigge's life in and around the rue de Seine. Charming and sometimes even funny, Rilke has a way of comforting and making for a relaxing read. But to think this work stands up to the quality literature I have read of today is ludicrous and perhaps a bit audacious. To hold a poet like Rilke in such high esteem is understandable, but I fail to see his greatness here. But it is still early in my reading and often things can change for the better rather quickly. And it is likely I may be a bit too judgmental of this famous poet. But note I have just recently completed the reading of an eighteen year-old poet's first novel composed with the most brilliant and exquisite language. Mart\u00edn Adan's first book was the title La casa de cart\u00f3n (The Cardboard House) which was published in 1928. The novel was told through the mature and thoughtful impressions of a young man's experiences while vacationing with his family in the district of Lima, Barranco. Kept primarily as a journal the novel was rich in its language and images and goes to much further extremes in literature than Rilke has shown me thus far in his The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. The observations recorded on the streets of Paris by the character Malte Laurids Brigge I often find a bore. Though I am familiar with the neighborhood the character is found traipsing in, the people and things he chooses to focus on are too mundane and absent any feeling for me. I much prefer his reflections while sitting in his freezing room breathing bad air from his smoking wood stove. I am also suspect about a title when it is so revered and raved on but nobody seems to be able to write about its goodness in a way that interests me as well. It sounds like the same old crowd beating the same old drums. The massive herd I am not interested in. It does little for me to be told by some so-called official scholar or casual reader that this book is great without expounding on why it is or absent a demonstration of its genus. So far I have failed to grasp any importance to this book whatsoever except historically in much the same way I give due the canon of The Beats. Early on the book is rather haphazard as Rilke exits a somewhat silly description of a person on the streets of Paris for a seemingly unrelated memory of an additional death or ghostly visit by one since passed even long ago or read about in a book by Ibsen. It is almost a relief to me to have to figure out what Rilke is getting at by his flitting on the page. I prefer the seriousness of death over whacky observations over mannequins. I was determined to read the entire book. God knows I carried on reading it as long as I could. I made it through Book I and was hopeful for a reason to keep reading in Book II. But there was not. I am too old to actually finish this book. I have no time for any fiction that does not buy me out completely. More than halfway in, by page 105 of this edition, I am so tired and bored of anything Malte has to say. I now shall abandon the text for another book waiting on my shelf. I am not interested any longer in Rilke, or what anybody has to say about him. He is a dead poet whose work is dead to me as well. And it is not as if I have not tried. I gave him my best effort and got nothing in return. Nothing. And that is the saddest response to a serious reader, and seeker, such as myself. .", "Reading \u201cThe Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge\u201d is to have the feeling that you have never before read words used in exactly this way for exactly this purpose.

Rilke, perhaps most known for being the greatest German-language poet of the twentieth century, has written what can only be called a prose poem \u2013 but even to use this phrase is to reduce a fullness that cannot be reduced. This novel is symphonic, lush, and poignant. In its evocation of memory, it is Proust avant la lettre. But there are also moments of pureness and clarity that are reminiscent of Wittgenstein, which creates quite a striking contrast. Rilke\u2019s experience with art and art criticism highly influenced his writing. His prose-poetry is pure imagism, but is also full of expressionism and impressionism. All of this sounds like an unlikely salmagundi, but I can assure you that there is something lasting and moving that inheres.We are so used to novels being narratives of action that when we meet something like this, it gives us pause. There really is no plot here as most people would conceive it. The narrator calls to mind Dostoyevsky\u2019s Underground Man, brooding and destitute. Malte is haunted by the doppelgangers that he lived with during his well-to-do childhood, all now long dead; he is the only member of his ancient Danish aristocratic family. The book flits in and out of memories of the deaths of his father and other relatives and their relationships. In many novels, one can easily separate, if one wishes, content and form; here they seem to belong to one another, the poetry and the memory inextricably intertwined. Unlike many other reviewers, I wouldn\u2019t say that the novel is difficult reading, but it might not be something that you want to read in one or two sittings. Like the \u201cDuino Elegies\u201d or the \u201cSonnets to Orpheus,\u201d they are meant to be dipped into. The text (at least in this edition) is subdivided into seventy-one parts which serve as breaks for the narrative line of thought. If you will excuse the length, this is from section twenty-nine, and it is representative of the style throughout:\u201cOne thing is certain: that on that evening I was drawing a knight, a quite solitary and unmistakable knight, mounted on a strangely caparisoned steed. He turned out so brightly colored that I had to change crayons frequently; but it was the red one that I used most of all, and reached for time and again. Now I needed it once again; but it rolled (I still see it) right across the brightened page, to the edge, and fell down, past me, before I could stop it, and was gone. I really did need it urgently, and having to climb down after it was distinctly vexing. Awkward as I was, it was quite a business to get down; my legs were far too long, and I couldn\u2019t draw them out from under me: remaining too long in a kneeling position had numbed my limbs; I could not tell what was mine and what was the chair\u2019s. At length, rather at sixes and sevens, I did make it to the floor, and found myself on an animal fell that extended under the table to the wall. But at this point I was confronted with a fresh difficulty. My eyes, accustomed to the brightness above and still wholly entranced by the colors on the white paper, were unable to make out anything at all below the table, where the blackness seemed so dense that I was afraid of knocking against it; so I fell back on my sense of touch and, kneeling and supporting myself on my left hand, combed through the cool, long-haired, familiar-feeling fell with my other hand. But there was no sign of the crayon.\u201d .", "Rainer Maria Rilke is considered to be the greatest German lyric poet--an assertion to which I could not personally agree or disagree with because I haven't read any of his poetry.

Written in a journal form, Brigge here muses about almost everything: his family, its history, God, women, love, life, death, art, poetry, reading and what have you (but not food, or chess, I did notice that). He recalls, narrates, makes one-way conversations (several times with God), goes into seemingly endless soliloquies, babbles like a drunk (I'm sure not really, but that was how he sounded--at times--to me). There are streams of consciousness, rivers of unconsciousness and oceans of hallucinations here. What a headache! Here, for example, is Brigge/Rilke writing about fate, life, God, man, woman and love (I picked a short one; only the novel should give the reader a headache, not a mere review of it):\"Fate loves to invent designs and patterns. Its difficulty lies in complexity. But life itself is difficult because of its simplicity. It has just a few elements, of a grandeur that we can never fathom. The saint, rejecting fate, chooses these and comes face to face with God. But the fact that woman, in accordance with her nature, must make the same choice in relation to man--this is what calls forth the doomed quality of all love relationships: resolute and fateless, like an eternal being, she stands beside the one who is transformed. The woman who loves always surpasses the man she loves, because life is larger than fate. Her self-surrender wants to be infinite: this is her happiness. But the nameless suffering of her love has always been that she is required to limit this self-surrender.\"Imagine 260 pages of such nice-sounding, but practically incomprehensible, prose! Well, most probably I was just not up to the task of properly reading this novel which some consider to be \"one of the most influential and enduring works of fiction of our century.\" Let me just say, then, that this book has a grandeur I can never fathom. So instead of one, I'll give it two stars. It was OK.

Well, except for the title, I\u2019d definitely heard the title before \u2013 but I would have bet money the book was written by a man and that it was bad romance novel, at least, that would have been my best guess. Instead, this is now perhaps one of my all-time favourite American novels. It can be compared without the least blush of embarrassment with Steinbeck at his best and Harper Lee out killing mocking birds \u2013 and there are many, many points of comparison between all three writers. This one has completely captivated me \u2013 and in ways I had not expected to be captivated. My very dear friend Nell and I were chatting one day about Calvino\u2019s idea of the books one might write and how these ought to fit into an imaginary bookcase \u2013 the short version of his idea being, what books would you like your own book to be beside on an imaginary bookshelf? Anyway, in the very next email from Nell there appeared a list of books \u2013 one of which was this one. I went to the library to see if I could find it, and then to some second hand bookshops around and about \u2013 but with no luck. Well, six months or so later and now I\u2019ve read it. And god I can\u2019t begin to tell you how glad I am.The title is actually the perfect title for this book, but that is only true after you have read it \u2013 it is actually a remarkably bad title for the book before you have read it. I would not be surprised if 999 readers in a thousand would think that this would be a story about unrequited love. That this might just be a melancholy story about a protagonist, let\u2019s call him Mr Sadsack, who has spent his life looking for the perfect partner, but she is terribly allusive and although he sometimes despairs that he will ever find her no one reading this imaginary novel called \u2018The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\u2019 doubts that in the end our nice wee man will finally end up with his perfect partner. But no. Although the title might make you think the book is about this sort of thing, it is about nothing like this at all.I guess I could say that the book has grand themes about \u2018what is wrong with The South\u2019 \u2013 and that might make you form images in your mind of the inhuman treatment of black Americans in the southern states of America and the struggle to end segregation and a terrible legal system based on discrimination. And although you would be closer to the truth, it would still not be quite the book you might expect it to be.And if I said that it has themes concerning the subjugation of labour and how the economic system is sustained by creating the conditions by which the working classes are convinced of their fundamental inferiority so they do nothing to remove their fetters \u2013 and that the heart that seeks freedom is also a lonely hunter \u2013 all this would be true too, to a point, and not true beyond that point. There are parts of this book that made me think about Chomsky\u2019s political writings and how dreadfully long the truth has been known about oppression and exploitation and how dreadfully long it has been clear what needs to be done. And that this too is the part of the American tradition that is spoken of, if at all, only in whispers; for don\u2019t you know they\u2019re talking about a revolution in whispers?And if I said this book is about coming of age and the loss of innocence and how becoming an adult is actually a kind of death which we might long for, but where more is lost than it seems we could possibly dare to lose. If I said that the young woman in this who throughout the novel moves from being a child to becoming an adult (even without some of the possible horrible things that could have happened to her not actually eventuating) and yet she still basically loses everything by growing up \u2013 that would be mostly true too.And if I said that the book is about selfishness and how a moment\u2019s decision or thoughtlessness can have horrible and irrevocable consequences \u2013 well, you might think you\u2019ve read this book many times before \u2013 but again, I think you would be wrong.Or I could say that this is a book about how we fundamentally misunderstand others \u2013 for doesn\u2019t everyone misunderstand (project onto) John Singer, the deaf-mute who is more or less central to the story, whatever it is they need him to be? And isn\u2019t Singer guilty of exactly the same human frailty with his own friend Antonapoulos? I thought it was terribly clever of her to have Singer bring Antonapoulos a projector \u2013 I thought she was nearly god-like as a writer at that point.What this book is really is a warning \u2013 not a warning that I might have written if I was to write a book like this \u2013 but a dark and terrible warning all the same. Much darker and much more terrible than I think I would be capable of writing. No, I couldn\u2019t write a book like this, and knowing that fills me with the deepest of regrets. Because this is also a much more optimistic book than I think I would be capable of writing too.McCullers was 23 when she wrote this book \u2013 god, the thought of it fills me with awe. There are times when I would almost be prepared to believe that some people really do have older souls than the rest of us. It is as incomprehensible that a 23 year old could write this book as it is to believe that a woman of only 22 years could have written Pride and Prejudice. And the warning? Well, that you can be absolutely right in what you believe, you can be standing on the side of righteousness and hold the truth shining in the palm of your hand and be doing everything in your power to improve the lot of your people \u2013 and you can still be only half human. You can walk in the ways of the great project of your time, you can know and you can spend your life seeking to show the \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 so they too become part of the enlightened \u2013 and still you can be a damaged half a man. We are barely human without our dreams, but even when our dreams are not selfish and are directed at the greatest, the most noble of aspirations, we are still human, all too human.The scene with the two old men, the one black and the other white, arguing through the night until dawn about the best way to liberate those who are oppressed and unaware is achingly sad. And why? Because it is blindingly obvious to anyone with eyes that neither of these men could ever \u2018mobilise the masses\u2019. Their dreams are as just and pure and true as they are barren and impotent and without substance. They shimmer and flap and torment them both \u2013 and thus is the human condition.Of all the characters I think perhaps Doctor Copeland is the most poignant. He effectively loses his own children because they do not live up to his dreams for them, his need for them to fight for his ideals. This really is a key theme of the book, that dreams not only have the power to make us human, but can then over-power us and make us something other than human too. With the book being written at a time when Hitler was screaming at crowds of men standing with arms raised in salute this 23 year old woman had a much clearer vision of what was wrong with the world than I have ever been able to achieve. And she tells of this vision in the only way it can be told - in whispers.This really is a remarkable book \u2013 like nothing I imagined it to be and so much more than I could ever have hoped.. .", "She went there, didn't she.As I read this novel, I could tell McCullers was setting the stage for something truly horrible to happen.

But they were never as bad as I thought they would be. Until...Oh yes, she waited until the very end to rip my heart from my chest, throw it on the floor, stomp on it with her pumps and then throw it into the ocean to be eaten by sharks. How does someone write a book this rich and wise and honest at 23? How does a young girl write such darkness, such tragedy? Like Flannery O'Connor, she suffered from illness from a young age. Maybe that is where her darkness came from?As you can probably glean from the title, all of the characters in this novel are haunted by the ghost of loneliness. Mick is a young girl on the brink of womanhood. Like many teenage girls, she feels isolated and misunderstood, but finds solace in two things: the company of a deaf mute boarder in her family home and her true passion, music. Let me share a passage with you describing Mick's experience of hearing Beethoven's 3rd symphony for the first time:How did it come? For a minute the opening balanced from one side to the other. Like a walk or a march. Like God strutting in the night. The outside of her was suddenly froze and only that first part of the music was hot inside her heart. She could not even hear what sounded after, but she sat there waiting and froze, with her fists tight. After awhile the music came again, harder and loud. It didn't have anything to do with God. This was her, Mick Kelly, walking in the daytime and by herself at night. In the hot sun and in the dark with all her plans and feelings.This music was her - the real plain her.I can't emphasize enough how much that passage resonated with me. The theme of loneliness, of isolation carries through each of the characters we meet as McCullers weaves her magical tale. John Singer is a deaf mute who has only one person in the world he calls a friend; a fellow deaf mute. When his friend goes mad and is institutionalized, Singer no longer has his best friend by his side, he feels lost. Yet all of the folks in this small town are drawn to him. It's as if his deafness gives him a wisdom and understanding that others are sorely missing. Ironically, it's as if for the first time in their lives they feel the are being truly heard. Dr. Copeland is a black physician in the south. He feels isolated from his family because they don't want to follow in his footsteps; his ambition has driven away his wife and children. He feels isolated because he's a black man in a predominately white town. The only white person he feels he can trust is Mr. Singer. Jake Blount is a drunk and a drifter. His rage and inability to relate to others exacerbates his feelings of loneliness. Yet the presence of Mr. Singer soothes him. Biff Brannon is a cafe owner; people come in and out of his restaurant all day, yet he is alone. He and his wife have drifted apart even though they live in the same home; he has no children and no real friends, except for Mr. Singer.As I made my way through this journey, I hoped and hoped that things would turn out alright for these broken individuals. But things don't always turn out okay, and what you're left with is the harsh reality of life. We all experience tragedy. We are, all of us, lonely hunters..", "The heart is a lonely hunter and it can break in many different ways.  Mine broke several times while reading this stunning document of American life.

Mine broke several times while reading this stunning document of American life. What a rich and multifaceted story, and what a perfect complement to other giants of American storytelling of that era.  Just in the beginning, I saw traces of Steinbeck, most notably of his Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, in the small town talk and the slightly comical marital scenes. But the tone quickly grew darker, and when African American life was introduced and put into contrast with the poor white characters, deeply rooted issues of racism, prejudice, exploitation and segregation took over.I thought I would claim one of the most heartbreaking scenes to be the naive prayer of an old coloured person, whose hope in Jesus reflects the evil of racist society and its dominating gods perfectly:\u201cI say to Him, \u201cJesus Christ, us is all sad coloured peoples.\u201d And then he will place His holy hand upon our heads and straightway us will be white as cotton.\u201dMy heart broke for that desperate old person, whose religion is tainted by the hopeless situation of white supremacy, both in the spiritual and physical world. But it turned out to be a minor issue in the complex community of lonely hearts.My heart broke for the man who tries to change the lives of coloured people in his neighbourhood, exchanging belief in Jesus for belief in Marxism, and seeing the dogma of socialism as the natural conclusion of the teachings of Jesus. He reminded me of the confused characters in Wise Blood, who get rid of their aggressive religion only to create another anti-creed, while mirroring their previous behaviour exactly. They have been trained to accept an authoritarian dogma even if they drop their supernatural faith in gods. Religious at heart, they have to follow a strong leader. There is no freedom of thought. But even though the socialist idea contains respect and hope for a better future for African Americans as well as for the poor masses of workers in general, that concept of life is bound to fail as well in a world that worships and perpetuates white power and corporate domination of capital. My heart broke when a disillusioned socialist explains the brainwashing that takes place within society to make exploited victims of corporate thinking believe in \u201cAmerican freedom\u201d while rattling their chains. \u201cBut it has taken a hell of a lot of lies to keep them from knowing\u201d, he summarises. But still he chooses to fight his African American counterpart instead of joining forces for real change. Each one according to his own lonely heart and creed.Trying to obtain justice in such a society can only lead to violence and continued abuse, as a heartbroken father experiences first hand when he tries to enter a white court to demand justice for his son, crippled for life in a prison.My heart broke when I read about the gratuitous violence against the young coloured men, and their lifelong suffering as a result. They have no voice to cry out for justice, and their fate is that of an Invisible Man in Ellison\u2019s definition: they can\u2019t be seen because nobody wants to see them. BLACK LIVES MATTER, one feels like yelling, taking a knee for change after a long history of abuse. But we all know what power answers when one tries to make one\u2019s voice heard. Money and exclusive club behaviour speak louder than justice. Still.My heart broke because of the inhumane suffering of poor children in a society that doesn\u2019t care about healthcare, education and safety. Where children are allowed to recklessly carry weapons at the age of 7, there will be accidents that destroy several families. There is no statistical research needed to prove that general availability of guns has a negative effect on innocent people. When a child hurts another child with a firearm, both end up victims of an absurd interpretation of the \u201crights of man\u201d to protect themselves.My heart broke for the young girl who dreams of becoming a pianist, but whose fate it is to live and suffer a poor girl\u2019s life. Nella Larsen\u2019s Quicksand comes to mind - a life spent dreaming, without ever actually having a chance to follow one\u2019s heart.My heart broke for the deaf mute man around whom the other characters circle like the spokes in a wheel. People in his surroundings treat him like a god because his muteness allows them to give him the qualities they wish him to have. I bow to Carson McCullers for that perfect definition of a god: mute and therefore adaptable to our personal, private imagination! Only the mute\u2019s obese and egocentric fellow mute friend can\u2019t find anything godlike in him, of course, and he suffers as a result. The heart is a strange hunter as well. Some hearts are too broken to be mended, after all.My heart broke because the contrast between fascism and democracy is as vividly tangible to me in our present times as it was to the characters in 1940, witnessing the rise of Hitler in Europe. When a young Jewish boy explains to his own horror that he was a fascist before he knew what Hitler did to Jews, it echoes what lures young impressionable people to accept and worship the power of a populist narcissist:\u201cYou know all the pictures of the people our age in Europe marching and singing songs and keeping step together. I used to think that was wonderful. All of them pledged to each other and with one leader. All of them with the same ideals and marching in step together.\u201dThe wish for unity in sameness is strong in religious and ideological communities around the world at all times, but occasionally it takes control of a whole generation, as in the 1930s. The scary revelation, to the boy himself, is the fact that it works so well. He concludes that there is no time for personal ambition as long as fascism reigns in Germany. It is democracy against dictatorship, and all other issues are paling beside the great struggle of the time.My heart broke because it is true, but at the same time it is not. All the other characters still fight their own fights against racism, sexism, poverty and prejudice. Life is too complicated for us to grasp, even when we are living it in a small town in America, powerless and helplessly alone with our pounding hearts.The heart is a lonely hunter, but we can share our heartfelt stories and hopefully develop some compassion for the hearts of others, learning to treat them with care and respect. For they keep pounding even when they are broken. It just hurts as hell.\u201cTread softly because you tread on my dreams!\u201d.", "ROCK AND ROLLIt turns out that Miss McCullers did most of her great writing - most of her entire writing - before she was 30.

Rock and roll! After 30 she was too busy having ghastly illnesses and marrying the same guy three or four times, and dodging invitations to a suicide pact from the guy she married all those times. So when she was 22 - I ask you! - she wrote this first novel which is a stone American classic. I had heretofore thought that absorbing a ton of influences and developing a unique voice all by the age of 22 had only been done by Lennon/McCartney, Bob Dylan and Aubrey Beardsley, but Miss McCullers performs this remarkable feat too. Her surefootedness and precision are fantastic. I'm so much in awe that I feel sick to my stomach.METAPHORS FOR GOD WHICH IS A METAPHOR ALREADY Onto the book itself. The inexorable gravitational pull of the metaphor in all our verbal dealings is something I have mentioned before, so that even someone like Raymond Carver's ironed-flat tell-it-like-it-is bargain-basement prose still spins in stories like So Much Water So Close to Home or A Small Good Thing brilliant metaphorical explorations of the various uncomfortable truths he shoves our way (the ignored corpse, the tasteless birthday cake). Perhaps we no longer love overly obvious metaphors (Little Red Riding Hood) - then again, perhaps we do (The Titanic). But they're very useful when you try to talk about God - in fact it's impossible to talk about God non-metaphorically insofar as God is Himself a metaphor. Fictionmakers love God metaphors - last year we had Ron Currie's disappointing \"God is Dead\", a few years back we had the smart Jim Carey movie \"The Truman Show\", further back we have other movies like \"Whistle Down the Wind\" and \"Theorem\". In \"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\" John Singer, the deaf mute, the blank slate, the man who everyone talks to but who talks to nobody, stands for God. People pour out their dreams, fears & hopes onto him and he scribbles the odd bland sentence in reply and they think he understands all and knows all. In fact - and here's Miss McCullers' audacious vicious twist - John Singer is himself completely obsessed with another deaf mute who he thinks of as almost Godlike but who in fact is a fat greedy imbecile confined to a mental asylum. If we follow the metaphor along, not too fancifully I think, we find that Antonapoulos the idiot therefore represents the human race, with which God/Singer is fatally, poignantly, uselessly obsessed - Antonapoulos will never get well and was a sad mistake to begin with - so what does that say about the rest of us chickens? Not much.BRIEF ACTS OF APPALLING VIOLENCE Miss McCullers doesn't belabour this central conceit too much and she also throws in a ton of local knowledge but without smacking you upside the head every time like Annie Proulx does. And although this is a slow old read at times, a lot of doing nothing punctuated by brief acts of appalling violence (is this what the American South is like?), her sad sweet song of humanity is as beautiful a tune as I've heard all year..", "I simply cannot get this book out of my head. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like most everyone else I am astounded that Carson McCullers was only 23 years old when she wrote this. \u00a0Such wisdom and insight from someone so young is truly remarkable. \u00a0And there are so many great reviews out there, I just could not stop reading them. \u00a0A great many of them, as one might expect discuss the greater themes of this book and there can be no doubt that I too fell to pondering these many \u00a0things as I thought about the world today.I mI simply cannot get this book out of my head. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like most everyone else I am astounded that Carson McCullers was only 23 years old when she wrote this. \u00a0Such wisdom and insight from someone so young is truly remarkable. \u00a0And there are so many great reviews out there, I just could not stop reading them. \u00a0A great many of them, as one might expect discuss the greater themes of this book and there can be no doubt that I too fell to pondering these many \u00a0things as I thought about the world today.I mean just think about it:Racial inequality and discriminationEconomic division of the classesSubjugation and objectification of women and minoritiesSocial InjusticeWarStill I would like to talk for just a minute or two about another constant thread within this story and perhaps the best way to begin is to tell you about something that happened to me. \u00a0Way too many years ago when I was still \u00a0in the early stages of my career I got a promotion, one that I had worked hard to be considered for. \u00a0It was an important advancement for me. \u00a0No longer was I only responsible for my own contribution but also for the output of others. \u00a0As much as I wanted the opportunity to lead, once I actually got it, I was a nervous wreck. \u00a0I\u2019m sure my new boss sensed just how jangled I was and called me aside to have a little pow wow in his office. \u00a0It was a good meeting and he quickly reviewed some of the tools that he believed would help me achieve my objectives, but mostly he stressed that he wanted me to focus on one skill that his observations told him I already possessed. \u00a0The skill of which he spoke was listening. \u00a0He went on to add that far too many people forgot how to do it. \u00a0That people got so wrapped up in determining just how they were going to respond to someone or a given situation that they actually stopped hearing what was being said to them. \u00a0\u00a0If you want to succeed he said do not fall into this trap. \u00a0Listen carefully and not just with your ears he said, but employ all of your faculties. \u00a0If you can do this he assured me, everything else would fall into place. \u00a0Well that particular job really did not work out so well for me and I soon moved on to a new opportunity with a different firm, but I never forgot that first pep talk. \u00a0Over the years that came and went I thought about it frequently and reminded myself often to focus more on what others had to say than on my own words. \u00a0And not just professionally either, but at home and in other social situations. \u00a0Wise words, \u00a0that despite floundering on more than one occasion, have served me well these many years.

I found McCullers prose very simple and straightforward without the lyrical flourishes that I so love, however for depth of insight into the human psyche, the writing is a treasure trove. Throughout the book, I was reminded of the psychological defense mechanism of projection. You know how sometimes the things you literally hate about another person are those little parts of your own personality that you\u2019ve sheltered from the light, our shadow persona according to Jungian theory. In this novel, what most intrigued me was the power of attraction shown by McCullers\u2019s characters toward what was most loved in others, projection in the direction of love instead of hate. \u201cHow we see others is a reflection of how we see ourselves.\u201d(1) In this story, John Singer, a deaf-mute, attracts a motley crew of unusual friends. Biff Brannon, owner of the New York Cafe, Jake Blount, a drifter with a rough appearance, a penchant for alcohol and loud opinions, Doctor Copeland, a black man who cannot reel his children into his way of thinking or living, and lastly, Nick Kelly, a fourteen-year-old girl with a rich inner life, all become frequent visitors to John Singer\u2019s room. They all count him as a friend, telling him their innermost thoughts. It is, however, not their friendship that is most prized for him. For John Singer, it is the friendship of another deaf-mute, Spiros Antonapoulos, that jacks up his inner life. When Antonapoulos gets sent to an asylum by his cousin, Singer is bereft, and from there on, Singer seems to live for each visit to his friend. Since Antonapoulos seems to care only about the food treats that Singer brings when he visits, one can only assume that Singer\u2019s friendship is not nearly as important to him as it is to Singer. Meanwhile, Singer moves into the Kelly family home as a boarder and becomes the object of near adoration of his four frequent visitors. It is Nick Kelly who fascinates me the most. A coming of age tale, Nick is engulfed by her dreams and passions. Music is one of those passions and accompanies her nearly everywhere. As she straps baby brother Ralph into a wagon, she will entrust his care to seven-year-old brother, Bubber, and climb the roofs of houses. There her mind is free to soar. Is it because Carson McCullers was only twenty-three years old when she wrote this novel, that she got Nick Kelly\u2019s character pitch-perfect? And what is it about John Singer that is so attractive to Nick? Surrounded by five siblings, house boarders, and parents that are too busy struggling to get by, is it the fact that Nick has finally found a listening ear? Singer\u2019s listening is magical, but transcendence is a beautiful thing that is darn hard to accomplish. This is a tragic, sorrowful tale, and while hope is present, it is not abundant. This is a significant year in the lives of all these characters, and all of them will see major changes. Between fear and love, the human soul is stretched out. It is toward love that each of these characters has turned in their need for Singer\u2019s companionship, but it is also toward self-love. Some of them seem to have self-hate and self-condemnation from bitter pasts. Ever, the lonely heart searches for the path to self-acceptance and belonging..", "What a terribly sad book, and yet, so insightful about loneliness, despair and alienation that it\u2019s impossible not to love it, somehow.In a small town in Georgia during WWII, four very different people find solace in talking to Mr. Singer, a deaf and mute man who eats at the New York Caf\u00e9 every day.

The caf\u00e9\u2019s owner, a young tomboyish girl, an alcoholic communist and a black doctor desperate to affect change, are, each in their own way, all alone in the world. They operate at a slightly different level of vibration than the people around them, they feel hopelessly out of step and can\u2019t seem to adjust and fall in line with the rest of the world. But talking to Mr. Singer, who reads their words on their lips, shares food or plays chess with them soothes them in ways nothing else can.\u201cThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter\u201d follows the characters over the course of about a year, where their lives will take strange and unexpected turns and send them far from where they started. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, and in some ways it isn\u2019t, but the tiny, quiet and intimate events are often the ones with the biggest impacts on our lives, and McCullers does an amazing job of opening up her characters, making them achingly real, flawed yet sympathetic and as mentioned above, terribly sad. I\u2019m just repeating what many people have said before, but it boggles the mind that she could have written with such poignancy at 23.I sighed and wished for a better life for these characters, even if I had a feeling where they would end up. A good writer makes you want to hug the characters they create, and I wanted to bake all of them cookies.

I got about 100 pages into it and stopped. I didn't stop because I disliked it. Rather, it seemed at the time a natural result from the inertia and momentum of the book itself. Basically, I wasn't quite sure whether I had stopped or whether the book itself had simply stopped and I was just going along with it.I picked it up again because I've always had a nagging feeling about it, and because I hate leaving anything unfinished. And besides, the writing is very good, and there is quite a bit of promise in the book. Of course, all the promise turns out to be false, and that's pretty much the point. (Actually, I guess the point is not so much that the promise is false, but that it gets shut away.)The book is almost unrelentingly bleak. The main characters are all on the edge of despair. There isn't much chance of any of it getting turned around. And, since a happy resolution is not in the cards, most novels would push the characters over the edge in some sort of cataclysm. McCullers doesn't opt for that sort of showiness. Instead, she just further seals off each of her main characters from any possibility of genuine human contact. This resolution is even sadder, but for me it makes for a less compelling novel.I've read reviews of people complaining that nothing happens in this book. That's not true. There are lots of great incidents: a riot, a young girl accidently shot in the head, a prisoner losing both of his feet to gangrene after being put in the hole during a freeze, etc... But there's no plot. It never feels like any of the incidents drive anywhere else. And the wants of the characters don't lead to any of the incidents. It's almost like there is a complete disconnect. Similarly, because the characters are so unable to communicate with each other, there is also no possibility for drama. The characters kind of bounce off of each other from time to time, but they never actually interact. And again, I think all of this is exactly according to plan. But, for me at least, this plan doesn't make for an enjoyable work. And the bleak view of the world does not do much for me now. If I had read this book in my twenties, when i felt much more in tune with alienation for its own sake, I probably would have loved this book. Even now, I might want to switch my review to four stars because I can see that this is very well done for what it is. But it's no longer for me. I read somewhere a long ago that tragedy was for adolescents, and that comedy was for grown-ups. I hate to think of myself as a grown-up, but over time I do seem to have lost some of my taste for this kind of despair. .", "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCuller's Portrait of the Faces Behind the MasksThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter was chosen as a group read by On The Southern Literary Trail for January, 2017.

This is the third time McCuller's novel has been selected as a group read by \"The Trail,\" making it the most read novel by members of the group which was founded in February, 2012.Thanks to a former goodreads friend, I've learned I am only gently mad. It was a relief to discover that. Because my self-analysis has been that I'm excessively obsessive when it comes to the love of books. After having taken his recommendation to read A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books by Nicholas A. Basbanes, my soul is somewhat rested.However, there remains the fact I have, excuse me, had four copies of The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. I absolve myself for the first, it was a Bantam paperback picked up at the now defunct college bookstore, Malones. That paperback cost me lunch that day, even though at the time Krystal Hamburgers were only 25 cents apiece. For those not familiar with Krystals, they are much akin to White Castle. They are little, square, and served on a steamed bun, grilled onions,smashed down onto the little thin patty, and given a squirt of cheap yellow mustard. There are still days when I've got to have a Krystal. But they're not a quarter any more.My First CopyThe paperback was read and re-read. Somewhere through the years, it vanished, perhaps the victim of a garage sale during a period I call my former life--BD, i.e. before divorce. I hope it least went for the cost of a Krystal, but I doubt it.Lonely Hunter was not the first McCullers I read. Professor O.B. Emerson, Professor Emeritus, Department of English, The University of Alabama introduced me to Ms. McCullers through The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9 and Other Stories. That one cost me a sack of Krystals, too. That's all right. From my current waist line, it doesn't appear I missed too many meals.Dr. Emerson was a little banty rooster of a man, coal black hair, brilliantined to a shine that reflected the fluorescent lights of the class room. He considered McCullers essential to his curriculum in his Southern Literature course. From my first exposure to McCullers, I was hooked. The little man with the loud colored bow ties, outfitted in seersucker suits and a sporty straw hat made me a convert for life.After graduation, Professor Emerson and I would converse via telephone from time to time. He was gleeful to learn that The Execution of Private Slovikhad been made into a movie for television in 1974. I heard him click on his set and the ice cubes rattle in his Wild Turkey, his bourbon of choice. In my mind, I could see him with his books shelved floor to ceiling, all arranged, not alphabetically, but by coordinating colors of dust jackets. It was an aesthetic matter. I didn't understand it, and I took art. He was less impressed with the big screen adaptation of The Klansmanin 1974. Both were novels by Hartselle, Alabama author William Bradford Huie. Professor Emerson was a big Huie fan. He shared one thing in common with Huie. Both had received death threats from the Klan and had crosses burned in their yards--Huie, because of his novel, Emerson because he had Justice Thurgood Marshall over for dinner one night. It was Professor Emerson's proudest moment in life. He gloried in telling the tale.Since Professor Emerson introduced me to Carson McCullers, this review is for him. He died while I was out of town, some years ago. I missed his memorial service. I don't even know where he is buried. But I owe him much, because he imprinted me with a love of Southern literature. In some ways, I picture his life as one of loneliness, not unlike the characters you frequently encounter in the works of McCullers.But, I digress. I was supposed to be telling you about The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. I'm getting there. We Southerners are prone to digression. It's a manner of story telling in these parts.My next copy of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is the edition pictured. The jacket features one of my favorite photographs of McCullers.My Second CopyThe second copy was justified by love. Love justifies a lot. I just gave that edition away out of love for two of whom I call my honorary children, William and Nancy Roane. William is the director of a short film called \"Old Photograph.\" It should premiere this spring. I play a hard shell Baptist type preacher in charge of a home for wayward girls. The screenplay was a collaboration between William and his younger sister, Nancy. I think they are two of the most brilliant and engaging kids I've met. He's going through the Fulbright rounds, a senior at Oberlin, and she's in her first year at Oberlin.Nancy is a natural writer. Her story, \"Everyone knew Ruby,\" has been published. I've read it. It's good. Everyone only thought they knew Ruby. They found out they didn't when she committed suicide. It is William's next film project.I asked if either of them had read McCullers. Neither had. The central theme in Nancy's story echoes that in McCuller's The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. While celebrating Christmas and New Year's with them at a lunch, a few days ago, I presented them with my copy, inscribed with two quotes from the novel. \u201cThe most fatal thing a man can do is try to stand alone.\u201d The other was, \u201cAll we can do is go around telling the truth.\u201d Then I encouraged the Roane siblings to give the Coen Brothers a run for their money. I think they can.My third copy of Hunter is a beautiful slip-cased reproduction of the first edition from the former First Editions Library. I understand that Easton bought the company and that as copies in the series are sold, they will not be reprinted. Find this one, if you can. It's just a beautiful book to hold in your hands.The Third CopyFinally, I had to have the complete McCullers. I highly recommend Carson McCullers: Complete Novels: The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter / Reflections in a Golden Eye / The Ballad of the Sad Cafe / The Member of the Wedding / Clock Without HandsThe Fourth Volume of McCullers on my Library Shelf Although biographical influence is often scorned as a means to literary criticism, I don't think it is possible to fully explore some works without some knowledge of the life of the author. That's definitely true of Hunter. Carson McCullerswas born February 19, 1917, in Columbus, Georgia, the daughter of Lamar and Marguerite Waters Smith. Her birth name was Lula Carson Smith. She dropped the Lula around 1930. Her life was relatively short. Having a bout of rheumatic fever during her high school years affected her health until her death caused by a cerebral hemorrhage on September 29, 1967. Her life was spent in fits of creativity marred by acute episodes of depression. A good portion of her life was spent in a wheel chair.It does not come as a surprise, when you become familiar with McCuller's life that her literary works were filled with the unloved, the outcasts, and misfits. Nor is it any surprise that her works revolve around desperate attempts to form loving relationships and those relationships in which the lover's pursuit is one that remains unrequited.Carson began taking piano lessons at an early age. Her original plan was to become a concert pianist. You can find this experience as the basis for her story, Wunderkind.McCullers was a wunderkind until struck with rheumatic fever at the age of fifteen. She gamely continued through school to graduate at age seventeen. She intended to go to Juliard. She never made it there. She began taking creative writing classes at Columbia while working menial jobs.While in New York she met Reese McCullers whom she fell in love with too quickly and they married. Divorced once. Married twice. He was an alcoholic, prone to depression and ultimately committed suicide, wanting Carson to die with him. She refused, although she had attempted to commit suicide on an earlier occasion, alone.Shortly after their first marriage, the McCullers traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Reese found work. There, McCullers wrote Hunter. It was published in 1940. McCullers was twenty-three. She was a literary wunderkind. The book was an instant best seller, hitting the top of the market in sales. Critical reception was mixed.McCuller's title comes from Fiona MacLeodin her poem \"The Lonely Hunter,\" found in From The Hills of Dream Threnodies Songs and Later Poems. MacLeod wrote:\"O never a green leaf whispers, where the  green-gold branches swing:O never a song I hear now, where one was  wont to sing.Here in the heart of Summer, sweet is life to me still,But my heart is a lonely hunter that hunts on a lonely hill.\" It is 1931. The setting is a small mill town in Georgia.McCuller's initially entitled the novel, \"The Mute,\" as the central character is John Singer, a deaf mute, who can truly only communicate with his room mate, a Greek named Spiros Anastopolous. They have been companions for ten years, Singer working as a silver engraver in a jewelry store, and Anastopolous working in his cousin's fruit stand. John and Spiros can communicate through signing. However, Spiros becomes sick, a changed man, engaging in irrational behavior. His cousin commits him to an insane asylum. Singer is left alone, unable to communicate with anyone.With his companion gone, Singer moves into the Kelly family's boarding house. Mick is a gawky adolescent, unable to recognize the changes occurring in her body, unable to recognize what adolescents haven't yet done, the initiation into sex. She wants to be a musician, she wants to play the piano. Essentially she wants anything that she doesn't believe she can achieve until she begins to compose her own songs. It is with Mick that McCullers addresses the universal awkwardness of the coming of age.Singer no longer makes his meals in his apartment. Now, he takes his meals at Biff's New York Cafe. Biff's wife Alice dies and he is now alone.Jake Blount is a customer at Biff's. He is a labor organizer, an agitator. He is a Marxist. Blount drinks to excess. After meeting Singer, he speaks to him at length, incapable of understanding that Singer can't talk back. After becoming too drunk to navigate his way home, Singer walks him back to his room for company and to give Blount a place to stay for the night.Dr. Copeland is a black physician, disappointed that his children have not become educated but have been satisfied to take the menial jobs available to blacks in the South at that time. He is angry at whites, with the exception of John Singer who had once offered him the kindness of lighting his cigarette. Singer is the only white man who has ever shown him courtesy of any kind.The novel shifts from point of view, character by character. But Singer is always the central figure in McCuller's novel. Biff, Jake, Copeland, and Mick, all begin to regularly come to Singer's room where they confide their deepest feelings to him. Each feels that he understands what they say and feel. But he does not, nor is he able to communicate his longing for his former companion.Each of the characters who rotate through Singer's room wear a mask, rarely disclosing what they feel to anyone. It is only to Singer that they reveal their true feelings. It is safe. Who can Singer tell? Singer is almost the priest in the confessional.While each of the four have found their confidant, Singer grows more alone as he visits Spiros in the asylum, only to find that his friend has become more seriously ill with each visit. Spiros' death will be Singer's unraveling.Oddly, as Singer unravels, the confessing quartet begin to turn to others and bring them into their lives. Biff turns to his wife's sister, Lucille. Blount and Copeland find a common cause in discussing issues of race, politics, and class struggle. Mick and a young Jewish boy, Harry Minowitz, find first love after a swim in a nearby pond.(view spoiler)[None understand that after Singer learns his friend Spiros has died in the asylum why Singer would ever commit suicide by shooting himself in the chest. Each thought they knew him so well and that he knew each of them. (hide spoiler)]In East of Eden,John Steinbeck wrote, \"Perhaps the best conversationalist is the man who helps others to talk.\" John Singer did that very well.In the years since its debut, Hunter has steadily grown in stature for what is now recognized as its brilliance. The novel is number seventeen on The Modern Library's list of 100 greatest novels of the twentieth century. Time Magazine listed it on its 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.Richard Wright, in reviewing McCuller's first novel wrote:\"Out of the tradition of Gertrude Stein's experiments in style and the clipped, stout prose of Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway comes Carson McCullers' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. With the depression as a murky backdrop, this first novel depicts the bleak landscape of the American consciousness below the Mason-Dixon line. Miss McCullers' picture of loneliness, death, accident, insanity, fear, mob violence and terror is perhaps the most desolate that has so far come from the South. Her quality of despair is unique and individual; and it seems to me more natural and authentic than that of Faulkner. Her groping characters live in a world more completely lost than any Sherwood Anderson ever dreamed of. And she recounts incidents of death and attitudes of stoicism in sentences whose neutrality makes Hemingway's terse prose seem warm and partisan by comparison.\"So, Professor Emerson, this review is dedicated to you. I don't have any Wild Turkey, but forgive me as I lift this shot of Gentleman Jack in my toast to you. I miss you.Yet, as McCullers said,\u201cThere was neither beginning nor end to this sorrow. Nor understanding. How can the dead be truly dead when they still live in the souls of those who are left behind?\u201d Amen.EDIT: This novel was selected as a group read for the goodreads group \"On the Southern Literary Trail\" for April, 2012. It is shared for the benefit of the group, and, hopefully to draw interest to a novel that deserves to be read.Mike Sullivan,Founder and ModeratorReferences1.

This year, so far, so good. I gave a lot of thought as to which classic book I wanted to use for my classic of North America square. There are a few authors that come to mind as classic American authors, where each piece of literature written by them reads like a story being told on one's front porch. The names Hemingway and Steinbeck first come to my mind, along with that of Carson McCullers. Distinctly southern and writing about the human condition during the era in which she lived, Carson McCullers is a literary treasure. My mother owns the complete set of her writing in one volume and I have previously read Member of a Wedding, which was a gem. It comes as little surprise then that I selected McCullers' definitive work The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter for my classic of North America square this year as her work comes straight from the heart and is a joy to read.I can not say much about The Heart is a Lonely Hunter that has not been written before. Taking place in a Georgia mill town during the Great Depression, McCullers writes of the trials and travails that occurred during that time. The town could have been her own and the female protagonist Mick Kelly could been McCullers when she was younger. She speaks out about racism, fascism, the rights of the disabled, as well as the depression, through the alternating chapters told through the eyes of her archetypal protagonists Singer, Biff Brannon, Jake Blount, Doctor Benedict Copeland, and Mick Kelly. Readers find a woman ahead of her time in that she views blacks, Jews, whites, men, and women as equals, and this was during the 1930s. Perhaps the fact that McCullers was all of twenty three years of age when she wrote this timeless novel speaks to her views of society in that her generation did not emerge as leaders until the later 1940s, when people did start to speak out against racism and lack of rights for women. Published in 1940, McCullers work was slightly ahead of its time and most likely eye opening for many.With blacks and whites, Jews and gentiles, unmarried men and women sharing dialogue in the south, McCullers work is refreshing for this era as well as the country has become as polarized as it was during the times of separate but equal. Each of her protagonists had much to say about society, and each had a plan as to how to better themselves and the world that they lived in. The world needs more people like Doctor Copeland, Biff Brannon, Jake Blount, Singer, and Mick Kelly. Yet, they are a thing of the past and many of their inclusive views with them. The literary world also needs more writers like Carson McCullers who spoke her mind from a young age. Her work remains as timeless as ever and her Georgia mill town an archetype for forward thinking people. Carson McCullers work should be viewed as North American classic writing, and I look forward to reading more of it in the coming year.5 timeless stars.", "And here we are in the world full of probabilities, reasoning with the unreasoned existence, awestruck at the purposelessness of life, at actions with no consequences, at endings with no more re-beginnings, once we die, we die.

Every soul who breaths life, seeks love, to love and be loved the vain and only desire of humans, we can\u2019t help desiring so, we can\u2019t help loving those who gave up on us, we can\u2019t help hoping against hope, and the torment one endures is never justified with any word of any language, but that forsaken love never perishes\u2026The very essence of platonic love, is seen in the figure of Singer, our main character, It is one of the characteristics of ideal romantic love, derived from Platonism, that it need not be reciprocal; the beloved, indeed, may even be unaware of the lover's existence or the existence of love, love never dies of indifference, never diminishes by ignorance, but the relation of singer with Antonapoulos is not entirely of this sort, it is, in view of the latter's limitations, an approximation of it. Singer's love does not require reciprocation but it does require an object, we may never be in our lives come to see our beloved, but we want him around us, the surety of sharing the same sky can appease much, the certainty of breathing in same air is of comfort immensely, because love needs not reward, or love in return, it\u2019s not an act that expects to be re-acted, it\u2019s the whole life as we keep living, we keep loving ,and when Antonopoulos dies, his own reason for living dies too.........As for other characters, each of the five main characters strives to break out of his or her isolated existence. The reasons each character is isolated are very different: the deaf-mute John Singer cannot communicate with most of the world because he cannot speak; Mick Kelly cannot communicate with anyone in her family because they do not share her intelligence and ambition; Biff Brannon is left alone when his wife dies; Dr. Copeland is alienated from his family and from other black people because of his education and viewpoints; Jake Blount is alone is his radical social viewpoints and in the fact that he is a newcomer in town.The fact that Carson was only twenty-three when she completed this heartbreaking tale, makes it sadder than before, and I can\u2019t help thinking, was Carson in truth, trying to carve a home god of her own, who would play silent and listen to her bruised heart? and history says, she didn\u2019t find any, instead died at fifty with a weighty heart. who had so much to say, but heart........\u2026remained a lonely hunter!.", "Rating: 4.99* of fiveA near-perfect book, a joy of a read, and a heartfelt \"thank you\" to the goddesses of literature for it.

At the centre of this group is Singer, a deaf mute - an intelligent and sympathetic receptacle for their hopes, anger and fears.Singer is a wonderful character, a quiet urbane gent who when not tending to the spiritual needs of his friends, is visiting his lifelong soulmate in a mental institution. This is a story primarily about ordinary, unremarkable people and their daily struggles, but it is also a book about bigger issues ............ grinding poverty, the great racial divide between the black and white communities and raw politics, as the hot seam of anger bubbles over in the minds of those who rail against the injustice that surrounds them. Anger that often deflates into a sense of hopelessness.This is a melancholy, often heartbreaking novel but the narrative is full of incident, the characters fully realised and the writing enriched by the lyrical, painterly eye of the author.

Poverty, segregation, disease, and struggle are all themes in this southern gothic beauty, but it is loneliness that reigns supreme here, a truly desperate need to connect, and an ache-inducing inability to do just that.John Singer, a deaf-mute who reads lips, is the central figure of this book. He is a magnet that the four main characters (Mick, Jake, Biff and Dr. Copeland) are drawn to. He is the friendly face, the listening ear, the sounding board for their dreams. He provides a respite for their hopelessness. He's like a Jesus figure in the middle of a desert, offering cool refreshment. He becomes what each person wants him to be - an amazing magic trick spun by the simple fact that he does not speak.But what they don't know is that Singer has his own Jesus figure, his own centre of gravity - another deaf-mute man and his only friend, Antonapoulos - a self centred and piggish man who lives in an asylum. Singer's devotion to Antonapoulos is baffling and makes the reader question Singer's wisdom, as well as warm compassion for a man who seemingly receives nothing in return for the outpouring of his heart.So what happens if we lose our beacon, our life raft, and find ourselves alone, truly alone?Maybe she would think about a phrase of hurrying jazz music. Or that a bowl of jello would be in the refrigerator after she got home. Or plan to smoke a cigarette behind the coal house. Maybe she would try to think a long way ahead to the time she would go north and see snow, or even travel somewhere in a foreign land. But these thoughts about good things wouldn't last. The jello was gone in five minutes and the cigarette smoked. Then what was there after that?This book is understated in that there is no grandness to the plot, no spiking crescendo of action. The people in this book are not exceptional - they are real, living their lives, and they want more from the world than what they have been given.It's clear Carson McCullers grew up faster than most, given her deep understanding of the world by the age of twenty-three, when she wrote this book.

The central character is a deaf mute of almost saintly demeanor, Singer. His story constitutes the narrative spine along which the stories of his fellow characters are strung. These include Mink Kelley, a 13 year old girl; Dr. Copeland, the unnamed town's \"negro\" doctor, who knows that civil rights for his people is in the offing but is frustrated and angry that his own efforts toward that end have been ineffective; the alcoholic, Jake Blount, a carney whose narrow ideological Communism leaves him frustrated and angry. Blount is in many ways the white counterpart of Dr. Copeland. Their thinking is similar on many levels, but their meeting of the minds is not a productive one. Biff Brannon is the owner of a local restaurant, the New York Cafe. He is probably gay, as may be Singer, whose mute roommate Antonapoulis is committed to an asylum in the early going because of anti-social behavior. There's a wonderful, almost unflagging narrative sweep here that is rare in my reading experience. McCullers wrote this when she was 21 and 22. I think her greatest gift as an author is her deep empathy for her characters. It is this empathy that gives the book its powerful emotional appeal. The novel is mostly rendered as straightforward chronology. There are a few flashbacks, but McCuller keeps these to a minimum. The action takes place in an unnamed southern mill town in what is perhaps Mississippi between two distinct historical events: British PM Chamberlain's appeasement of Nazi Germany at Munich (30 Sept. 1938) and Hitler's demand for Danzig from Poland (late August 1939). But these events are only meant to provide context, and the immediate threat they represent to the nation is not a major concern. It is the South. The hot, humid, muggy, buggy American South. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a classic and I recommend it strongly..", "By the time Mozart was 5, he was composing his own music and performing for royalty.

Why I myself, if you\u2019ll forgive me for crowing, memorized the batting averages of every member of the Cincinnati Reds\u2019 starting lineup as a 12-year-old. So is it really all that impressive that Carson McCullers wrote this top 100 book* at the ripe old age of 23?! (Sorry, my humor never matured much beyond the days of Reds\u2019 glory.)I have to confess that it was almost a distraction to read this knowing how young McCullers was to have written something so insightful, polished and world-weary. She managed to get deep inside the heads of five very different characters in a mill town in Georgia just prior to WWII and give voice to their many valid concerns. In the case of John Singer, the voice was purely an inner one. He was a deaf mute. In a way, he was the central island in the archipelago to which the others hoped to connect. Singer was a good listener (reading lips) and had understanding eyes, but there was a bit of Chauncey Gardiner about him, too, in that people assumed more of a Christ-like, simpatico alliance than was possible from their confidant. They didn\u2019t realize how sad and lonely he was himself when his only friend, another deaf man, had been sent to the asylum. Singer\u2019s hands (used for signing) became silent.Among the other characters, the adolescent tomboy, Mick Kelly, was most prominent. She\u2019s said to be a semiautobiographical construct, which is easy to believe given her lanky appearance, her artistic sensitivity, and her advanced intellect. To me, she was a more human (read flawed, troubled and nuanced) version of Harper Lee\u2019s Scout. She was written so powerfully \u2013 it was easy to ache alongside her as she craved more music (her big love in life) and peace of mind (that family circumstances would not allow).Doctor Copeland was another memorable character. As a highly educated black physician, he had few peers, but he had a vision for lifting his people and combating racial injustice. The lack of progress was brought home convincingly as McCullers did an excellent job personalizing it through him and his family. She was evidently ahead of her time, casting a critical, clear-sighted eye on the relations of the day. The two other POV characters were Jake Blount, a hard-drinking carnie mechanic with a Marxist bent, and Biff Brannon, a caf\u00e9/bar owner with a generous, aesthetic spirit struggling against alienation. They, too, bared their souls to John Singer as a part of an empathetic hub and spoke model.We get to know a handful of other characters, too, valuable for advancing the plot and populating the communal landscape. The Jewish boy growing up with Mick who fears the news out of Europe, Dr. Copeland\u2019s son who finds himself on the wrong (black) side of the (white) law, Mick\u2019s little brother George whose impulsive actions led to dramatic changes (most profoundly in himself) \u2013 they all had important parts to play.Things happen in this book, but I wouldn\u2019t call it plot-driven. It\u2019s mostly profiles of the people and reactions to the times. There was precious little cheer to go around. Faced with that fact, McCullers never did flinch. As one of the chaps in Spinal Tap once said, standing at Elvis\u2019s grave, it was almost \u201ctoo much bloody perspective.\u201d Sugar must have been scarce in the Depression-era South \u2013 scant amounts to coat the world that she saw. But there seemed to be hope for sweeter days ahead. Even if I\u2019m wrong about those hopes, this is an important and authentically observed book, well worth the time.*In 1998, the Modern Library ranked The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter seventeenth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.

This one is set during WW2, told with strong musical currents (she had a place to study piano at the Julliard, and this shines through most of her work) and a radical passion against poverty and injustice.

The language is generally quite simple in terms of vocabulary and sentence length, yet the characters and events are all the more poetic and vivid for this apparent simplicity - a difficult literary trick to pull off.The main character is John Singer, a deaf mute. Biff Brannon (caf\u00e9 owner), Jake Kelly (migrant mechanic and social activist), Dr Copeland (black doctor and communist) and Mick Kelly (girl of 13-14) all attach themselves to Singer, who is of course, the perfect listener for their varied troubles and a blank canvas for them to create him as a god-like figure of whatever kind they each want. The main plot is Singer's relationships with the other four (they have almost none with each other). The subplot is a coming of age strand regarding Mick: moving from passionate and ambitious tomboy to frustrated young woman.Each character who unburdens themselves to Singer thinks they know him and that he is something of a free spirit. None of them know that he is pining for the burden of caring for Antonapoulos, his former flat mate and fellow deaf mute, now in an asylum. In that relationship, Singer did all the talking and assumed that wisdom and empathy came from Antonapoulos, who largely listened. Now on his own, the tables are turned and he is cast in the role of wise listener. Singer's animated hands are redundant for communication - neglected and stuffed in his pockets.We all need a Singer, but no one wants to be Singer.All the closest relationships in this story, even amongst the minor characters, are compromised by literal or emotional distance or largely unreciprocated, though the characters themselves are not always aware of this.As well as sadness, there is often an underlying sense of menace, though when bad things happen, they are often not what you had expected until a page or two before they happened, making them somehow more shocking.Overall, a powerful and sad book, yet somehow not a depressing one. Despite much tragedy, there is always a glimmer of hope, arising from love and loyalty (even if it is one-sided).

No I didn't choose to accord that previously withheld star bowing to a monster named 'peer pressure'. The actual worth of a work of literature can be measured by the power it wields over a reader once the last page has been turned. And this is exactly that kind of narrative which refuses to let go even after you have managed to extricate yourself from its emotional chokehold. I had believed the specter of oppressive gloom to be well and truly exorcized once I closed the book a few days ago, comfortable in the certainty that other pending items on the to-read list will monopolize my attention soon. And yet that didn't happen. As much as I appreciated falling under the spell of Shirley Jackson's dark and disqueting 'Hill House' or revelled in Erica Jong's tongue-in-cheek brazenness, a sort of inexplicable wistfulness came over me last night. I longed for the tedium of that nameless, ramshackle town in the deep south and that familiar all-consuming sense of doom shared by its inhabitants. I craved once again to listen to the conflicted inner voices of the forlorn quartet who sought to purge the spiritual turmoil brewing within them through the companionable silence of a kindred spirit.\"She wondered what kind of music he heard in his mind that his ears couldn't hear. Nobody knew. And what kind of things he would say if he could talk. Nobody knew that either.\"The hauntingly plaintive notes of their emotional desolation reach me no more; the dirge has played itself over after all. But their untameable restlessness has seeped into my being unknowingly. I resent this inability to wrench myself away from the world of Mick Kelly, Biff Brannon, Jake Blount, Doctor Copeland and John Singer. I cherish it at the same time. And I want to live in exile in the company of these solitary outcasts, perpetually engaged in the futile quest of disentangling the mess of existence.There are layers upon layers to this book that reveal themselves once the post-reading rumination phase begins. At the time of its publication, the deep south was carving out an existence around a kind of fragile status quo almost in the same manner as South Africa under Apartheid was. My mind still fresh from MLK's autobiography, thus, Doctor Copeland's unwavering faith in a 'strong, true purpose' appeared as a kind of foreshadowing of the rise of a Martin Luther King a decade and a half later, a veritable leader fated to help instill a fierce sense of self-esteem in the members of a disinherited community and consequently save an entire nation from a dangerous identity crisis. McCullers's depiction of race relations is imbued with a kind of subliminal prophetic certainty that the already tottering edifice of discrimination and injustice cannot possibly stand for long. \"For masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.\" - Virginia WoolfAnd the above quote from A Room of One's Own is the final and most definitive reason for awarding this enduring classic 5 stars. It's not just McCullers's voice which rings out in mournful solidarity with the disaffection and thwarted aspirations of the central characters in this novel. Rather it's the imperfectly harmonized chorus of voices of an entire generation belting out a sombre refrain and asking for release, for freedom from countless indignities, for the assurance of a life worth living. \"...in a swift radiance of illumination he saw a glimpse of human struggle and of valor. Of the endless fluid passage of humanity through endless time. And of those who labor and of those who-one word-love. His soul expanded. But for a moment only. For in him he felt a warning, a shaft of terror. Between two worlds he was suspended.\"The lonely hunters may have bid me farewell already but they have shared with me their wisdom and courage and taught me the language of their despair and feeble hope.

And so I obey, and I go. I go and listen to the mute choir of the lonesome and the restless, of the disinherited and the excluded, of the alienated and the embittered. Isolated voices withering in despair, wrestling in incomprehension, anguished voices that interweave with each other creating a desolate fugue where only the tuneless can sing.A nameless mill town in the middle of the deep South during the thirties serves, not only as a background orchestra for these discordant voices, but also as the universal representative of the spiritual solitude that underlines the human condition. Four main characters struggle against different kinds of afflictions depending on race, class, age and sexuality. Thirteen-year-old Mick Kelly nurtures her passion for music locked in her secret \u201cinside-room\u201d. Mr.Coperland, a colored doctor, tries to control his anger against the submissiveness of his race. Jake Blount, an alcoholic communist wanders from town to town spreading his inner contradictions. Biff Brannon, the owner of the Caf\u00e9, sits behind the booth and observes it all, especially boyish Mick, who seems frozen into eternal youth.These disconnected individuals, eager to appease their escalating sense of alienation, pivot around John Singer, a deaf mute, whose grey eyes offer mute solace. \u201cSpeak against unconscious oppression,Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative,Speak against bonds.\u201d \u201cSpeak\u201d, continues Pound\u2019s song. And speak is what these four rotating \u201csatellites\u201d do while hovering around their beaming sun, their self-created icon, like blind moths being drawn recklessly towards the scorching lightbulb. They all turn to Singer like starving souls, pouring all their turmoil into his opaque face, which looks back with a peaceful glance, a glance that swallows it all. Despair, anger, shame, pain, emptiness. All of them gone, diluted in the indefinite wells of easiness emanating from John Singer\u2019s being, who becomes the so much coveted savior, the embodiment of goodness and empathy, the guardian angel who listens and understands. \u201cMick Kelly and Jake Blount and Doctor Coperland would come and talk in the silent room \u2013 for they felt that the mute would always understand whatever they wanted to say to him.

Something invisible to others?For what these lost souls don\u2019t know is that Mr. Singer wanders the night as the most lonely of them all, imagining the face of his friend, his lover, the face of his only reason to keep on moving, his only reason to be.Love, even when seemingly directed at another, is often a form of egoism. What is then, the adored one? Only a blank canvas on to which anything can be painted, only a shallow mirror reflecting whatever is wished. As in a chimerical fantasy, these off-balance voices, enraged by events, at once bruised and musing, fixate on the make-believe scene they create in their locked minds and think they live, cheating themselves.\u201cOh how hideous it isTo see three generations of one house gathered together!It is like an old tree with shoots,And with some branches rotten and falling.\u201d As the trees in Ezra Pound\u2019s poem, the condemned, the voiceless and the rejected stand staring at the abyss of their own incomprehension, in a world hovering on the edge of a Great War. Some will fight their loneliness with violence and depravity, some with sex or drink, and some \u2013 like Mick \u2013 with a quiet but fierce resolution to keep the beauty of Beethoven\u2019s (also a deaf) \u201cEroica\u201d engraved in the most recondite part of her soul.But mostly, they will be suspended in uncertainty, swaying between radiance and darkness, between bitter irony and faith, between music and silence; eternally bend in a double-edged posture where empathy can be corrosive as well as liberating, where one can imagine the other as a melody of life, or as McCullers appears to be saying, as a melody of death.\u201cWonderful music like this was the worst hurt there could be. The whole world was this symphony, and there was not enough of her to listen.\u201d (107) *****Note: I have had the pleasure to read this novel at the same time that my friend Tej and his criss- crossed comments and kind encouragement have made of this novel an even more intense reading experience.

Biff in his New York Caf\u00e9, Mr. Singer in his muteness, Mick in her Inside Room, and Dr. Copeland in his sickness are all joined together by a longing, unrealized, to surpass their circumstances.

In Biff's words, \"Why? Because in some men it is in them to give up everything personal at some time, before it ferments and poisons - throw it to some human being or some human idea. They have to.\" (P. 32). Seeking clarity, Dr. Copeland says to his daughter Portia,\"I am not interested in subterfuges...I am interested only in real truths.\" (P. 78)There is little redemption for these characters as their truths will ultimately break, as Mick's brother Bubber/George says prophetically, \"I come to believe we all gonna drown.\" (P. 160)The languid descriptions of the Southern town where the story takes place tell the interior story of the characters: Mick trying to coax Bubber out of hiding, \"The yard was lonesome and the wind made quick, scary shadows and a mourning kind of sound in the darkness.\" (P. 175)Copeland strains against his heart, \"The faces of his suffering people moved in a swelling mass before his eyes. And as he steered the automobile slowly down the street his heart turned with this angry restless love.\" (P. 197) The \"angry, restless love\" actually plagues each of the tortured and beautifully drawn characters during the year that the book takes place. Meanwhile, the mute Singer is plagued with memories of his interned friend Antonapoulos: \"Those ugly memories wove through his thoughts during the first months like bad threads through a carpet.\" (P. 203). Singer serves as a kind of Zen figure, a center around which the other characters turn and in whom they project their fears and hopes.How Carson McCullers could have achieved this kind of maturity by writing this book when she was only 23 is just short of a miracle. Suffice it to say that nearly any other description I could give would spoil the story for you, so I will just leave you to discover (or rediscover) this masterpiece. A must-read.This was another case where the Pulitzer committee blew it. Here's what wikipedia says about the 1941 prize for which McCullers would have been eligible: The fiction jury had recommended the 1941 award be shared by The Trees by Conrad Richter and The Ox-Bow Incident by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. While the Pulitzer Board initially intended to give the award to the jury's third choice, Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls, the president of Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler, persuaded the board to reverse its judgment because he deemed the novel offensive, and no award was given that year.What a travesty! Arguably, the prize should have been a choice between McCullers and Hemingway. I liked Ritcher's book, but have not read Clark's classic. But, how dumb to not give an award at all and give zero chance to this masterpiece.My list of Pulitzers.", "I've been reading Carson McCullers for the last month.

I started with this book and then picked up each of her five other books one after the other, leaving myself no time in between to think about what I've read or consider writing a review. Today, I'm glad that I didn't attempt a review of this one because I just came across a piece in the sixth book, The Mortgaged Heart: Selected Writings, entitled Author's Outline of 'The Mute' (later published as 'The Heart is a Lonely Hunter'). Her own words describe her intentions for this book so clearly that I'm going to use them in lieu of a review:....The general outline of this work can be expressed very simply. It is the story of five isolated, lonely people in their search for expression and spiritual integration with something greater than themselves. One of these five is a deaf man, John Singer - and it is around him that the whole book pivots. Because of their loneliness these other four people see in the mute a certain mystic superiority and he becomes in a sense their ideal. Because of Singer's infirmity his outward character is vague and unlimited. His friends are able to impute to him all the qualities which they would wish for him to have. Each of the these four people creates his understanding of the mute from his own desires...In his eternal silence there is something compelling. Each one of these persons makes the mute the repository for his most personal feelings and ideas...This situation between the four people and the mute has an exact parallel in the relation between Singer and his deaf-mute friend, Antonopoulos. Singer is the only person who could attribute to Antonopoulos dignity and a certain wisdom...About this central idea there is much of the quality of a legend. All the parts dealing directly with Singer are written in the simple style of a parable.Before the reasons why this situation came about can be fully understood it is necessary to know each of the principal characters in some detail. But the characters cannot be described adequately without the events which happen to them being involved. Nearly all the happenings in the book spring directly from the characters. During the space of this book each person is shown in his strongest and most typical actions.Of course it must be understood that none of these personal characteristics are told in the didactic manner in which they are set down here. They are implied in one successive scene after another - and it is only at the end, when the sum of of these implications is considered, that the real characters are understood in all of their deeper aspects....Carson McCullers then goes on to describe her plot and characters in great detail before finishing with some notes about time, place and structure. I was very interested to see that she had a musical structure in mind because I'd experienced the book in musical terms even as I was reading it. This is how she describes the structure: The form is contrapuntal throughout. Like a voice in a fugue each one of the main characters is an entirety in himself - but his personality takes on a new richness when contrasted and woven in with the other characters in the book.One of the other interesting things that emerged for me is the amount of material she eventually left out of this novel. Because I've read all of her novels and most of her stories at this point, I realise that she recycled some of those deleted scenes. Characters' names and circumstances have also been recycled which makes reading all of her work together extra rewarding. The reader begins to see the entire cast of characters as part of one big family and all of her themes as being connected. She is always writing, in one way or another, about inner isolation and the battle to overcome it..", "The book is finished. But not the story.

To know. What? A meaning. Why? A riddle.There are definitions galore for life and each one of them carries the trace of bittersweet truth which is hard to embrace and harder to relinquish when the hunt for some meaning in the sea of vagueness is the last resort in front of us. With every new book I read, I try to gather the fragile pieces of such eternal verities which ends up in taking me two steps ahead and one step backward en route to solving a nameless, cosmic riddle. May be I imagine it all and one day I\u2019ll find myself at the starting point with all the curiosities and confusions intact but till such eventuality occur, I take solace in the stories of all those hunters who were lonely in their expedition; in the stories of all those who knew. A cross between an exquisite dream and a harrowing nightmare, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter starts off like a simple tale celebrating the humdrum of everyday life, but as the pages of this novel treads the path of a new home, a different alley, a faraway Southern town and lives of four different characters, it excavates the treasure chest of voices buried in the reclusive hearts of those who were born and silenced during an inopportune time. The people dreamed and fought and slept as much as ever. And by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.And yet this darkness brings out the moments of epiphany for youthful Mick Kelly. Music is her elixir of survival but she can\u2019t hold it in her hands for an indefinite time. Darkness brings Dr. Copeland face to face with his relentless disappointments. His struggle against injustice, indifference and submissiveness is in a dire need for a guardian angel. Darkness evokes the horrific illusions for Jake Blount. He surrenders himself to work and alcohol to change the vision of a dreaded future and try to retain the scattered shreds of hope residing in his beloved books by Marx and Veblen. Darkness opens the tacit eyes of Biff Brannon who is able to see and observe more clearly the fogged image of confessional souls coming and going through his ever welcoming diner door.  There was no noise or conversation, for each person seemed to be alone. The mutual distrust between the men who were just awakened and those who were ending a long night gave everyone a feeling of estrangement.This rampant distrust and loneliness makes other enter through a different but familiar door. The door leading to John Singer\u2019s room. He becomes the pacifier to shun that ominous feeling of estrangement. A deaf-mute who is assumed to be there for everyone. His silence offer the much awaited consolation for the desperate sounds. He\u2019s a supposed messiah of happy times and a listener of the forlorn. A sort of mythical mirror which reflects everything one wants to see and successively turns everyone blind to its truth. In the end, it all culminates into an unforeseen tragedy where one almost wishes to rewrite everything to save everyone from their ill-fate. If only such things are possible in life and literature. And this is where a reader comes into the picture. This is where a reader needs to stop and mull over the futilities and capabilities of their existence. This is where a reader realizes that being a person of solitary disposition is not always a matter of choice but sometimes ensues from an ironic stroke of time and destiny. This is where yours truly understood that Loneliness doesn\u2019t go away by receiving few moments of compassion but quietly stay somewhere as a faithful companion and emerges when the weakness of human nature results into fateful accidents. This is what McCullers showed me and this is what I know at the risk of being slightly right but not entirely wrong. As for Ms. Carson\u2019s writing, all I want to say that her prose touched the rustic chords of my anxious heart and composed an extraordinarily moving symphony which is still resonating in my ears and proved it once again that there is no dearth of noise in this world but only few things are worth listening to. There is no dearth of words in books but only few are worth reading.

Each human is a vessel of thoughts and emotions simply waiting to be poured forth to other vessels willing to reciprocate, each relationship a barter, an exchange of ideas and feelings, and so there remains in us a shred of influence from every person, idea, experience we encounter. Our lives a shared reality in ways we may not comprehend, a concoction of all impressions accepted mingled with the fear of those our formed identity rejects. Yet for a lot of people life is still a lonesome experience. Countless souls have spent years in search of someone to lend them time and understanding but have found none. Even those inside conjugal relations and tribal camaraderie still experience this feeling of solitude. Individuals forge relationships in order to find listeners but do not spare the effort to listen when it is their turn. And so convenient projections are created of each other resulting in fragile bonds that shatter at the earliest stages of conflict. Do we really have a thorough understanding of those we come in contact with on a day-to-day basis?The heart is a lonely hunter draws from the bitter isolation of individuals on their search for an outlet. Rejects of their own accord malcontent in the different paradigms they exist in. Four distinctive people filled with substance vastly out of place in their simple rural town and at the center of it, an ill-fated deaf-mute who accepts all and gives nothing. A political subversive, a racial activist, a flowering bud of classical music, and a detached voyeur all unload their lonesome bulks on a solitary and often confused deaf-mute. The projection of their ideal companion carelessly placed upon this unsuspecting sacrifice. All pour but none take the time to hear from their perceived equal, until this cracked vessel is broken due to its inability to unburden itself. Carson McCullers wrote this novel during her 23rd year. A lot of people seem surprised that this work, widely considered an American classic, was written by someone of her age. But this is hardly surprising, that timeframe of early to late twenties is a pivotal period in the human existence when loneliness is most pronounced. It is the time when we are forced to make harsh decisions that more often than not diverge from the idealistic dreams of our youth. This reality compels us to find solace in the shared misery of those around us who have also experienced the crushing bitterness of the world.McCullers perfectly captures the intensity of loneliness inside us when our failures float into the surface of our attention. This nurtured loneliness that plagues and torments never really goes away. It lingers and it hurts. Perhaps all we can do is share some of the pain to people who have chosen to suffer with us.\u201cThe way I need you is a loneliness I cannot bear.\u201d.", "I have read 8 of Carson McCullers books, and like the rest of the world I agree that this is her best work.

And where, I ask you, can a man escape to, when he hasn't enough madness left inside him? The truth is an endless death agony. The truth is death. You have to choose: death or lies. I've never been able to kill myself.\u201d Toni Servillo is Jep Gambardella in The Great BeautyI watched the Italian film The Great Beauty the other day. The film opens with a quote by Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line. \u201cOur journey is entirely imaginary. That is its strength.\u201d The film, directed by Paolo Sorrentino, is without a doubt the most influential film on my life that I\u2019ve had the pleasure to watch in a long time. I could talk about the lush truthful power of this film, but I don\u2019t write movie reviews and this, after all, is a book review. After the movie ended and I was sitting there surprised that something was managing to keep the mitochondria working after my brain exploded, and also feeling a hyper awareness of the red corpuscles starting to bring animation back to my slackened muscles; I realized that I needed to expect more from myself. I wanted to write something, climb something, jump over something, capture a moment of perfection, drink cognac from the belly button of a Sudanese princess, and drive something really, really fast. I decided to start by reading a book that has been sitting on my shelf for a decade called Journey to the end of the night, after all Sorrentino did begin his film with that quote by the French writer. I\u2019ve never read C\u00e9line and not for the first nor for the last time I felt a bit foolish to be caught not knowing something, not knowing why Sorrentino would begin his film with that particular quote. There is a cynicism in the movie which would seem to create the opposite reaction in the viewer to how I felt, but the presentation of such revelations was so artfully accomplished that what was so inspiring for me was the creativity involved in revealing the truth. C\u00e9line wanted to write a truthful novel. A novel that would state all those hidden thoughts and covert meanings that surround our communication with each other. C\u00e9line was pessimistic about humanity and wanted to call everybody out for really being just like him only everyone else is trapped in the conventions of secretly believing one thing and revealing quite another. His character, Ferdinand Bardamu, deserts the French army during WW1 at the urging of his friend L\u00e9on Robinson. After all his government, the French government, is frankly trying to kill him. Anyone who had been to the front would understand that it wasn\u2019t the Germans that were trying to kill him as much as it was the French officers who kept insisting that he do something foolish like rush entrenched soldiers with machine guns. Robinson is an interesting character. He keeps turning up all throughout the book. He is a more pessimistic, more selfish, more hapless version of Bardamu. A doppelg\u00e4nger that embraces all the worst elements of his own basic nature. \u201dLying, fucking, dying. A law had just been passed prohibiting all other activity.\u201dC\u00e9line was also in the war and actually won a medal for heroism. He was shot in the arm and wounded grievously enough to take him out of the action. Like Bardamu he went to medical school. In this book he lampoons the medical profession not only the doctors, but the people seeking medical help. C\u00e9line and Bardamu both spend time in Africa working for a company. Little is known about the time C\u00e9line spent in Africa which would indicate that it probably did not go well. It certainly did not go well for Bardamu, so poorly in fact that he was contemplating returning to the war. \u201cThe sadness of the world has different ways of getting to people, but it seems to succeed almost every time.\u201dBardamu is sold into slavery as a rower on a ship. The simplicity of his existence at the oars was actually for a while almost like a vacation from life. When they reach America he jumps ship believing that finally in the land of milk and honey he can achieve some level of happiness. America reminded him of his American girlfriend that he had for a short time in Paris. \u201dObviously Lola was nuts with happiness and optimism, like all people on the good side of life, the ones wit privilege, health, security, who still have a long time to live.\u201d America is not the best place for a lazy cynic. The prosperous optimism, wrapped in a can-do attitude was leaving Bardamu feeling exposed with his shield of skepticism buckling under the pressure. \u201dMisery is like some horrible woman you\u2019ve married. Maybe it\u2019s better to end up loving her a little than to knock yourself out beating her all your life.\u201dC\u00e9line went from hero to anti-hero during the 1930s when he embraced Fascism. He was antisemitic and during the war became a collaborator with the Nazis. After Germany\u2019s defeat he fled to Denmark. While away he was convicted of being a collaborator and sentenced to jail time. In 1951 he was granted amnesty and returned to France. You would think such a natural cynic would find the pageantry of Hitler\u2019s Third Reich, a twisted version of Disneyland, too nauseating to embrace, but obviously his anti-semitism and his vociferous denial of the holocaust allowed him to swallow the rest. Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9lineThis book is a scattershot of ideas with a meandering plot and does sometimes overreach with ideas presented with too heavy a hand when just a light slap will do.There are moments in the book when I was reminded of Henry Miller, Joseph Heller, or Thomas Pynchon. Black humor weaves in and out of the paragraphs keeping the cynicism from slipping on concrete shoes. At least now when I rewatch The Great Beauty or come across a reference to C\u00e9line in a book I can nod sagely and feel some satisfaction in not being one step behind..", "Poesy of twilight is nevertheless poetry\u2026The sunsets in that African hell proved to be fabulous.

The often colloquial, coarse and simple vocabulary he employed along with Proustian sentences make a visionary statement in terms of his writing and Jean-Paul Sartre was one of many who was a big fan, for me the book triumphs in it's tone, there is an elevation of sarcasm and wit throughout, there were times when I found the text so funny and others much more serous, but you can never quite figure out what was intended and what wasn't.

The adjective immonde (foul, filthy) cropped up every few pages; asticot (maggot) was frequent too, as was miteux (seedy). And the words noir (black) and nuit (night) recurred so often that when the main character, French army scout Ferdinand Bardamu, finds himself alone in a Flanders town called Noirceur-sur-la-Lys one dark night during WWI, I smiled at the name of the town\u2014it seemed deliberately invented toI hadn't travelled far into this book when I started taking notice of the word choices. The adjective immonde (foul, filthy) cropped up every few pages; asticot (maggot) was frequent too, as was miteux (seedy). And the words noir (black) and nuit (night) recurred so often that when the main character, French army scout Ferdinand Bardamu, finds himself alone in a Flanders town called Noirceur-sur-la-Lys one dark night during WWI, I smiled at the name of the town\u2014it seemed deliberately invented to heighten the mood the author had been creating with many of his earlier word choices. I imagined Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line laughing to himself as he thought up that name. Noirceur means darkness, obscurity, and even holds a connotation of evil. The name made me expect a host of ghostly figures to emerge out of the gloom, and sure enough, a man does appear out of the blackness. He turns out to be an army deserter called L\u00e9on Robinson. And because Bardamu thinks Robinson resembles a dead soldier they find soon afterwards, I became convinced that Robinson was nothing but an apparition, especially as he disappears from the story almost as abruptly as he enters it.The WWI part of the book ends very soon after that in any case. Bardamu is invalided out of the war and the reader might think that all the darkness, all the foulness, all the evil are over and done with, and that the remaining three quarters of the book will be brighter, cleaner, more hopeful. Such a reader would be very disappointed. C\u00e9line doesn't seem to know how to write about the bright, the clean, the hopeful, and we soon find that it doesn't matter anyway because he just writes so well about seediness and about hopelessness, about illness and about death. If we hang in with Bardamu all the way to the end of the night book, we too will sink deeper and deeper into the mire as we shadow him south to the Congo River, west to New York and Chicago, back east again to one of the poorest suburbs of Paris, then south to a crypt full of dead bodies near Toulouse, and finally to an asylum on the edge of Paris. As we follow in Bardamu's footsteps, we are fully entertained with regular doses of comedy and with paragraphs of startling insight.But Bardamu has another shadow too: L\u00e9on Robinson turns up in the Congo, appearing and disappearing in the darkness of one single tropical night just as he did in Noirceur during the war. Later he emerges out of the polluted gloom of industrial Chicago, and later still, he turns up in Toulouse and on the seedy streets of suburban Paris. It's as if Robinson is Bardamu's alter ego, an alternative personality, friendly sometimes, an enemy at other moments. But whatever he is, he is a very interesting plot device on C\u00e9line's part: a recurring figure who influences every stage of the story even to the final outcome. And it's nicely ironic that the words C\u00e9line puts in his mouth on his first appearance in the town of Noirceur are about not wanting to kill anyone, not having yet learned to kill anyone. That becomes more and more significant as the narrative plays out.As to Bardamu, he has never learned to kill anyone either, but he becomes good at leaving people to die. Yes, they are two halves of a whole, Bardamu and Robinson, but they finally get split apart forever in the most unexpected way. The ending felt to me as if C\u00e9line had set off all the fireworks he'd buried in the dark places of the story. I knew they were there all along and I worried about them exploding. It was just a matter of time. **************************************Though I didn't mention them, there are quite a few women characters in this book, but while each dominates her own section, none of them reappear or meet with any of the the others\u2014except in one case near the end. The fact that each woman is confined to her own segment must have been on my mind because I dreamt about it one night during the time I was reading this book. In the dream, one of the characters was explaining why she and the other women didn't ever share a scene. The explanation was long and complicated as is the mode of dream scenarios. The only scrap of meaning I retained on waking was that they were practicing social distancing! This book will go on my Covid Times shelf. *I searched a map of Northern France and found a town near Ypres called Aire-sur-la-Lys. It has a 15th century church that sounds similar to the one Bardamu mentions seeing in Noirceur-sur-la-Lys..", "Huge crush!

There are no illusions about human nature, no frills, no indulgence in a pseudo-fraternity, but attempts to take a step back from what destroys the human being and try to learn to live despite it or instead with it. There is a contradictory mix between despair and the desire to live against all odds in this flayed man, which I find magnificent and could help most of us. Because it is not to veil the eyes that make progress but to look things in the face and laugh about them if one can, I think Celine's outlook on life will stay with me for a long time. Yes, \"Journey to the End of the Night\" is a great book.And too bad for \"political correctness\"!

My principle memories of reading this for the first time were a) being bored and b) buying a bunch of The Smiths and The Cure tapes at a garage sale. For some reason when I saw this book sitting on my bookshelf last week I thought I'd give it another try. Why? I don't know exactly. I have lots of unread books, but I felt like I might have not gotten everything I could have from the book. This time I quite enjoyed the book. It's a nice antidote to any feelings that things were probably better 'back in the day', it's good to cleanse the mental palate of this particular delusion now and again. Things were bad then too, which means that if there is a constant in lots and lots o' people being worthy of disgust, then to grumble about it too much can be i) fun, but ii) a tautology and thus ii.a) not really relevant and ii.b) not at all applicable to the discourse of progress/barbarism/ whatever you want to call it. For example; does this mean that most people being shitty fucking assholes is relevant to all of those douchebags wandering around oblivious to anything but their own phone conversations? Is pointing out all of the assholes and defining them as such, really any different than saying all people have heads, and most of them have hair on their heads? And then basing most everything you say about the headedness/hairedness of people? No! Instead is it possible that in a Kantian categorical something or other people can be a priori described as assholes? All of them of course except for you and your loved ones, and me and my loved ones. We are of course the exception. Now, I'm not saying everyone is a piece of shit. And neither is C\u00e9line, in fact there is one character who isn't in the book!! One!! There is hope for us yet, sadly that one decent person is stuck sitting on a river in Africa with one other person who is an asshole. But he's out there, you know sort of Kurtz like. Now I could do a number of things here. I could give a plot synopsis, aka write a book report. I could try to come up with some kind of serious analysis of the book. I could try to write a 'mock' C\u00e9line style something or other, that probably wouldn't be too funny. I could ignore the book altogether and write about myself, and use the book as a vague jumping off point; i.e., write all about the types of people I hate and make myself C\u00e9line like. I could also post some pictures of animals, which I actually like to do because then I can come back and look at them later and I figure maybe you do too. I could do all kinds of things. I could just end the review here and then strike up a conversation with another goodreader who would actually be me in disguise, but we'd be really witty and surprisingly similarly read in titles that aren't that common; of course I would vote for me too, and if you tried to call me on it I would just ignore you and change topic with myself. I could do any of these things. There are so many choices, and it is so overwhelming in the various ways I can try to fleece votes, which can be cashed in for all the AMAZING prizes that are only available to the people who are on the best reviewer list. Please don't ask for details about these prizes, I've said too much already. .", "If Celine had shut his trap around the 300 page mark he might well have clung on to that elusive fifth star, but as it is, finishing his amazing horrible novel composed of ten thousand variations on the theme of human life being 95% unbearable misery and 5% boredom and everybody smells bad becomes an exercise in readerly self-flagellation.How many times do we need to be told this doleful message?

Will Self wrote an article for the NYT saying he learned everything he knows from Celine. Catcher in the Rye is a rich teenage Celine. It goes on - in the first section of Journey, the hundred pages that deal with World War One, you can hear Catch-22 clearly \u2013 he\u2019s the only guy that realises that everybody is trying to kill him. He knows it\u2019s nothing personal but that really doesn\u2019t help. \"I reject the war and everything in it\u2026 I don\u2019t resign myself to it\u2026 I don\u2019t weep about it\u2026 I just plain reject it and all its fighting men, I don\u2019t want anything to do with them or it.

For absolutely nothing!\u201dVia a period skulking in a veteran\u2019s hospital he gets discharged and signs up to a company running one of those colonial outposts in darkest Africa (Cameroon). He\u2019s in for a different onslaught of ghastliness, this time from nature in all its insect life and unpleasant diseases. He attempts to flee from the horror, the horror \u2122 and gets captured and sold into slavery on a galley ship just like he might have in the second century BC. This was the part I thought did not ring entirely true \u2013 galley slaves in 1917? Seriously? Anyway, up to that point Journey is a stone classic, wonderful frothing at the mouth page after page and exactly the kind of thing you would froth about, too. Here\u2019s one of my favourite Sayings of Ferdinand :When you stop to think about it, a hundred people must want you dead in the course of an average day, the ones in line behind you at the ticket window in the Metro, the ones who look up at your apartment when they haven\u2019t got one themselves, , the ones who wish you\u2019d finish pissing and give them a chance, your children, and a lot more.Then, with his brother galley slaves (!) (they also had sails on this boat) he reaches New York. His miserable existence improves greatly. He travels to Detroit and gets a job there. But he\u2019s still ranting about the hideousness of everything. He decides to go back to France and complete his medical studies and become a doctor. Still ranting and frothing and badmouthing everything in sight, Still further down, it\u2019s always the Seine, winding from bridge to bridge like an elongated blob of phlegm.he becomes the poorest general practitioner ever and so bumbles along for the rest of the book, the same old sour-minded misanthrope we know and love by now,My patients were mostly people from the zone, that village of sorts which never succeeds in picking itself entirely out of the mud and rubbish, bordered by paths where precocious snot-nosed little girls play hookey under the fences to garner a franc, a handful of french fries and a dose of gonorrhoea from some sex fiend. a few anecdotes here and there, a few \u201ccharacters\u201d to entertain us (mostly unhinged) but no improvement in our guy\u2019s attitude to life even though his situation has improved from catastrophic to dire to scraping a living. He slouches and slimes his way around France spewing forth maledictions and depressing maxims like an out of control I Speak Your Doom machine. As for sick people, patients, I had no illusions\u2026 in another neighbourhood they\u2019d be no less grasping or jug-headed or weak-kneed than the ones here. The same wine, the same movies, the same sports talk, the same enthusiastic submission to the natural needs of the gullet and the arse would produce the same crude, filthy horde, staggering from lie to lie, bragging, scheming, vicious, brutal between two fits of panic.Are there any chinks of light at all? For a few pages, not more than five at a time, he hooks up with a woman and blow me down, arch-cynic Celine serves us up not one but two examples of that most familiar of bit parts, The Tart with the Heart of Gold. That surprised me.Well \u2013 fans of this book, and there are a great many, will disagree with me when I say that there is just TOO MUCH of it, and 99% of it is one long monotone, one endless screech, so sorry, I have to say 4 stars only.

At points Celine soundCeline\u2019s Journey to the End of Night is a towering achievement in literary observation through a narrator incapable of self-delusion and a less than stringent filter between his thoughts and his audience. Plus, it\u2019s funny as hell.The novel reads as the author\u2019s travelogue through war-torn Europe, remote Africa, industrialized America, and post-war France. I have no idea how much of Journey to the End of Night is factual and how much is fiction, and I don\u2019t care either way. At points Celine sounds like a depraved Jonathan Swift but just as often functions as a spiritual ancestor of Thompson\u2019s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He riffs on everything from dreary Detroit factories to over-the-top descriptions of African tribal life. He transcends the easy lure of exotic locales by focusing on human relationships in all their debauched, fugacious forms. You know how when people say things like, \u201coh, people are generally good\u201d? Celine would, ahem, disagree. He\u2019s not mindlessly misanthropic; you get the feeling that if he could find evidence of pure-heartedness (and he thinks children have a shot) he would report it, but he\u2019s not going to lie to make you feel better (unless he does, but then he\u2019ll chastise himself later). In turn, he ditches the subtle narrative convention of \u201chappy endings\u201d (not the kind you get on the side of the interstate, but my guess is Celine would have no problem visiting that type of establishment) and instead wanders through myriad landscapes, especially focusing on the subcultures of the poor and twisted. He\u2019s not their champion, and he\u2019s not going to paint either a pastoral picture of simple poverty or portray the neighborhood residents as mindless animals, but if he had to deviate from the mean he\u2019d probably lean toward the latter. Celine is a master at characterizing the absolute insanity of, for example, war. Instead of singing gentle folk songs against military action he addresses the insane expectation of his military leaders to dodge German bullets in the middle of French farmland roads. And his wide-eyed perceptions of the depths of humanity are more insightful than ponderous. If Celine is trying to teach you a lesson it\u2019s that most human beings are scratching together an existence day to day, keeping their bones and body intact, searching after base pleasures, and really, kind of messed up. People aren\u2019t to blame for this: Journey isn\u2019t a self-help guide (unless, um, you\u2019re looking to seduce French women). But lest I sound as if this book is 344 pages of depressing observation after depressing observation, Celine finds the humor and objectivity to step outside the masquerade and in turn possibly transcend artifice, even for a little while. And although Celine doesn\u2019t equate that transcendence with morality, and might mock me mercilessly for even mentioning the possibility, by acknowledging human need and darkness in all its plain, everyday forms one takes the first step in becoming something other than what some might perceive is the inevitable norm. Celine, for all his misanthropy, carries hope. I needed close to four weeks to finish off this book; I read slowly and carefully and after some sessions felt exhilarated and exhausted. Don\u2019t give up if after the first twenty pages you think this book will be primarily about Celine\u2019s stretch in the French military. He moves out of his war narration fairly quickly. I also understand that the author was a real-life asshole. I can\u2019t speak for that. His novel stands among the best and most original I have ever read. Journey to the End of the Night, a dark classic of the highest caliber, is a whirlwind of psychological investigation, frenzied comedy, and fascinating discourse on human nature..", "Fifteen years of sitting on my bookshelves and I finally get around to reading it.

Of course, I was in high school at the time (and it was boarding school at that),so that explained it.At age thirty-two, Journey to the End of the Night set somewhat differently with me. Ferdinand Bardamu's miserable picaresque travails seem more absurd than sympathetic. I read him as foolish and vain and naive, inclined to rattle off world-weary grand pronouncements about the state of civilization. The sort of nihilist one-liners you might expect to find scrawled on the back of a bathroom door in the French Department at your local state university. I'm not entirely sure whether Celine intended his narrator to be a humorous character. Maybe he did. But the overarching, unmitigated darkness and misery of the book is so one-note after about page 100, I found myself wondering whether if it wasn't some elaborate prank, a self-satire. And every now and then, I would get a hint of this. Bardamu's Kafka-esque journey to Africa (during which he manages to incur the wrath of every other person on the ship, for no reason, and barely escapes capital punishment at the hands of a vigilante posse headed up by evil women). His journey out of Africa in the throes of malarial hallucinations (by far, my favorite part of the book . . . I had such high hopes when the Princess of Spain showed up) and subsequent job as a flea-counter at Ellis Island. And the ever-elusive Robinson. What's frustrating is that parts of this book were brilliant. The language was frequently stunning. Some of the secondary characters were memorable. And maybe it's just that I've grown jaded (though not as jaded as Bardamu) with age. Celine's influence has been substantial. Sartre, Kerouac, Heller, Vonnegut, Robbe-Grillet, Burroughs, and Bukowski count him as a significant influence. And I've read those authors. I even like a couple of them (though Burroughs and Kerouac are two of the most overrated authors in the history of literature and Bukowski is, simply, a complete fucking joke . . . more on that later).

It's the end of the world...The truth is death.\"Ultimately, however much we connect with family or society, we must confront death individually.Madelon and the PicaroThe clearest insight into the narrator, Ferdinand, comes from Madelon: \"First you cuckold your friends, then you beat their women!\"They are polar opposites, almost rivals for the love or affection of Leon Robinson.Whatever ostensible pride Ferdinand might have, Madelon is \"clean and beautiful\", somebody who makes a point of \"fidelity and respectability.\" She attacks his deluded self-esteem, his arrogance, his narcissism. He responds by slapping her face, twice, \"hard enough to stun a mule\".Both of them encounter light and darkness. Both experience loss and grief.Ferdinand is a picaro. The novel is as picaresque as anything by Cervantes, Rabelais, Sterne and Swift, except it's set squarely at the cusp of both modernism and modernity. At times, it seems like a precursor to Saul Bellow's more upbeat and upwardly mobile \"The Adventures of Augie March\". Yet Ferdinand is more old world plebeian than new world noble Augie. In his eyes, the promise of an American-style dream is a cinematic illusion. It turns humans into machines in the name of both production and consumption. A Lecherous ExistenceIf there's one word associated with this novel, it's misanthropy. However, Ferdinand doesn't so much hate the rest of mankind as float along in life, trying to make \"practical headway in the course of my harassed existence\".The concern of this man is his own existence. The other players are bit parts.As Robinson says to Madelon, \"Ferdinand isn't a bad sort, but delicacy isn't his strong point...nor fidelity either!\"He derives the greatest love and pleasure from the American, Molly, and \"her long, blond, magnificently strong, lithe legs, noble legs. Say what you like, the mark of true aristocracy in humankind is the legs.\"In other words, he's a pretty typical, lecherous, single guy, an \"anxious, frustrated man\", occasionally appreciative of \"a blonde with unforgettable tits and shoulders\", driven by the desire that resides in his testicles, and a quest for amusement and happiness, provided it doesn't come at too great a cost:\"Like it or not, a day should be one long almost unbearable pleasure, one long coitus...Happiness on earth would be to die with and while having pleasure.\"Could life, after all, be one long coitus, and then you die?Beyond MisanthropyI started reading the novel, expecting to be repulsed by its misanthropy. Initially, I was surprised by its fluency, the way the narrative progressed almost organically like life itself, then I succumbed to the exuberance of its story telling, its unexpected sense of humour, its black comedy, even if \"all the rest is shit and misery.\" Eventually, it seemed that, but for the violence against Madelon, it wasn't as misanthropic as its reputation would have it. Thus, for me, it was a far more enjoyable reading experience than I had anticipated. Don't be deterred by anything you've read or heard (including this review). This is a genuine classic! Pessimistic, cynical, perhaps, but still marvellously entertaining..", "Cool book. Great read. Bold, Unique and Fascinating.

I can see how this has influenced Joseph Heller, Henry Miller, William Burroughs, Charles Bukowski and Kurt Vonnegut. Truth be told it was Vonnegut\u2019s writing about him that drew me to read this. But whereas Vonnegut is concise and funny, Celine\u2019s writing is drawn out, meandering and often brutal in its casual pessimism. It\u2019s like a drunken and depraved Fitzgerald, and from a continental perspective. Ferdinand Bardamu survives The Great War in France only to then go on a Conradesque foray into the African trade business. Surviving central Africa with his life, he then travels to New York and has some adventures there before returning to France to become a doctor to the poor and impoverished, never truly escaping poverty himself. Throughout his travels he parallels life with Leon Robinson who shares with Bardamu many of the misadventures that make this so hypnotic.I thoroughly enjoyed the opening scenes, loved the ending, and plodded though the rest of novel in a haze of morbid curiosity and confusion. Celine uses the literary device of ellipsis to move the narrative along and I was reminded of Conrad\u2019s Nostromo by it\u2019s elliptical offstage descriptions.This has been called one of the great novels of the twentieth century and I can see that, but I did not love it. While there are some Hunter S. Thompson like moments of observant clarity, some redeeming scenes and few and far between humorous elements, this was a dark and gloomy ball-peen hammer between the eyes..", "All you who are reading these very lines right now, are waiting for a review, an analysis maybe of Journey to the End of the Night, I bet.

Journey was published in 1932 and was his first novel; it is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement. Those of you who know me may be sensing a but! Well, mostly the foibles of writers are forgivable; we all have them. Celine had his fair share. In 1937 Celine wrote a tract called Trifles for a Massacre; the first of three tracts. They were rabidly anti-Semitic and racist. Celine threw his lot in with the Nazis and argued for an alliance between France and Germany. \u201cWho is the true friend of the people? Fascism is.\u201d\u201cWe do not think enough about the protection of the white Aryan race. Now is the time to act, because tomorrow will be too late.\u201dOnce France had fallen Celine supported the Nazis. The head of propaganda for the Nazis in France, Payr, was of the opinion that Celine was too extreme to be helpful. After the war Celine had to leave France as he was wanted as a collaborator. His opinions did not really change; he became what we would now term a Holocaust denier and in 1957 said that white Aryan Christian civilization ended with the battle of Stalingrad. John Banville called this the best novel ever written by a far-right sympathizer and I think he may be right. It is also pertinent to bear in mind that many of Celine\u2019s fellow writers fell for the Soviet system rather than fascism. Coincidentally I am reading The Gulag Archipelago at the moment and Stalin also murdered many millions of his fellow countrymen in the name of peace and an ideal society. The difference with those who followed the Soviet path is that most of them abandoned it when it became clear what Marxist-Leninist practice actually involved. Celine stuck to his beliefs.Interesting to note that the other books I am reading; Orlando, The Gulag Archipelago and The Recognitions, all have a lower average rating than Journey. That, for me, is a bit of a conundrum; whilst it is good and a seminal influence on the Beat generation (that, of course might prejudice some of you against it!), it isn\u2019t in the top rank. Celine is in the tradition of Balzac, Zola and many of the great French writers. There is also a touch of the Don Quixote about it with the character of Robinson (who crops up fairly regularly) acting as a sort of Sancho Panza. There is a sort of picaresque nihilism about the narrator, Ferdinand Bardamu. The malarial hallucinatory passages in French colonial Africa are pure Heart of Darkness and the industrial passages in America have a touch of Upton Sinclair.It is ultimately a pessimistic reflection on life. Some may look at ordinary life and people and see nobility, beauty and struggle; Celine sees ugliness, bestiality and pointlessness.

This is the story of a man living his life, a man who, curiously, immediately understood the misery of life and tries to piece together his own during his different journeys from the first world war, colonial Africa, capitalist America, then back to the backwaters of Paris. Bardamu is a nihilist, a coward, a lecher, but otherwise a generally upstanding person. Perhaps his nihilism was inbred or perhaps he caught it during the war after making every conceivable effort to survive and not be deployed to the front lines. I don\u2019t blame him. He sees the entire thing as madness questioning the sanity of anyone who would gladly offer their lives all in the name of their country. At some point he was admitted to a mental institution with a bunch of deserters and their whole act was to burst out with immeasurable episodes of patriotism. Impassioned shouts of \u201cVive la France!\u201d filled their corridors on a daily basis. It became a game of one-upmanship. No one thought them sane. I found it absurdly hilarious. The first hundred pages or so I would consider a tragicomedy.\u201cThere were so many people whose names, mannerisms, and addresses I had lost, whose friendliness and even their smiles, after so many years and years of trouble and worry about the next meal, must have turned into pathetic grimaces, like old cheeses\u2026 Even memories have their youth\u2026 When you let them grow old, they turn into revolting phantoms dripping with selfishness, vanity, and lies\u2026 They rot like apples\u2026\u201dPost-war Bardamu isn\u2019t as much fun. He goes through different places and meets different people and each experience wears him down bit by bit. In the muck of it all Bardamu\u2019s miserableness initially had the frivolous quality that can be attributed to the rebellion of youth. But as he grew in years the quality was traded for the unsettled kind, attributed to mid-life, that made him waste any opportunity at stability even when he found the person that he would most love and who had the same amount of love to give back. Eventually, he becomes resigned to his fate just looking to preserve any ounce of comfort he has. Isn\u2019t that representative of human life?

In some ways the structure and approach felt similar to Augie March, if Augie March had been written by a horny Frenchman with a particular penchant for legs and asses. The style doesn't help - frankly I found it tedious and obnoxious, and not in the least interesting. The book escapes a lower rating because of the occasional moments when the author seems to remember he is writing a novel - the times when he tones down the obnoxious style and comes out with something really quite excellent.

I would go further and state that once you have visited the world Celine has depicted, it is difficult to return from whence you came. It becomes part of a truth that you have declined to admit but now must own.

Yes, he was an iconoclast, a nihilist, a misanthrope, an awesome humorist, as was his protagonist, Ferdinand. But aren\u2019t we all, in degrees? And for those that reject even a scintilla of this designation in themselves, it is most probably out of fear. And Celine deals with these apprehensions, courageously. To accept what we desperately and continuously hide from ourselves (forget about others) is not a common path. It hurts. A lot. Always.There are not many chillingly honest accounts of existence; turmoil, happiness, loneliness, friendship, love, aesthetics, health. Why, because it is too darn ephemeral, evanescent, nocuous, random. And because it is a hard sell. One must ache for honesty. Here, we recall how we hurt ourselves, how we bled, when we screamed and when we felt disenfranchised. Memories surface of frights, of hunger, of the cold, the darkness we have passed through, always available to recall at the nonce. We are reduced to what we really are, nothingness. We are challenged to embrace the absolute absurdity of it all. If you are unwilling, this book will not please, it will freak you out.Would you pay good money for a ticket to a carnival where everyone is stripped naked; physically, spiritually, morally, as if these words have definitions?

The only thing about the book which can be called poetical is the title taken from Song of the Swiss Guards, 1793:\"Our life is a journey Through winter and night, We look for our way In a sky without light. \" No plot, no deep characters, simple prose with regular dosage of quotable reflections and a lot of satirical, cynical and sarcastic jokes - it kept on reminding me of Kurt Vonnegut Jr. who, btw, has listed him as an important influence. I don't think you will find much in there that you don't already know - but all the same what is in there is not said enough in literature. Remember alien test? Its ordinariness is what makes it so brilliant. Now isn't these kind of thing some emo or cynic soul sitting in a college canteen would say:\"Just plain living, what a drag!

Everything done on name of nationalism, religion, love is hypocrisy. \"Misery is like some horrible woman you've married. Maybe it's better to end up loving her a little than to knock yourself out beating her all your life. Since obviously you won't be able to bump her off. \" He feels revulsion at seeing the misery of poor, seeing their children dying. At times he would let his poorer patients off without asking for payments:\"When you get paid by the rich, you feel like a flunky, by the poor like a thief.

And your ship goes down.\"Despite his efforts at humor, you could see an angst building in him that will latter turn him towards facism. Perhaps that is what happens if we look at reality too much - we will want to destroy the world. Perhaps we are not meant to know the truth; it is better off left veiled in songs and movies. \"Truth is inedible.\"Perhaps that is the real choice for us - to be hypocrites or to be murderers. \u201cAnd where, I ask you, can a man escape to, when he hasn\u2019t enough madness left inside him?

Celine's impetus to writing this book largely came from the trauma he suffered while serving in World War I. Celine was a continual and consistent cynic who no doubt loathed what he viewed as a society full of hypocrisy and folly. The gloomy narrative is replete with vulgar slang, sardonic jocosity, incessant agonies and pessimism, with heavy use of exaggerations and ellipses to reflect the flow of Bardamu's dialogue. He seems preoccupied to the point of mania with, or to gaining serial self-gratifications by, ferociously hurling vituperations at society, human nature and life generally, and by vilifying all human institutions and Jews.In short, Journey to the End of the Night, and each word of it, constitute the literary equivalent of dark chocolates for those seeking to maintain maximum melancholia and perfect a plenary pessimistic perspective.\"A cynic is a man who, when he smells flowers, looks around for a coffin.\" H.

Published in 1932 (with an English translation published in 1952 that I bought in the seventies at San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore, then lost after I had read some excerpts, and maybe some of it in collections later), it is a semi-autobiographical novel that Celine also called \"confessions,\" focused on Ferdinand Bardamu and his doppleganger Robinson. For the time, it was profane, colloquial, conversational, and is associated with the word nihilism more than almost any other word. Since in the last couple years I have been rereading some of Charles Bukowski's works, and knowing Celine to be one of his very favorite writers, I couldn't get out of my head how influenced Bukowski seems by this guy's life perspective and honest, profane, yet always interesting writing style (oh, Celine is much better, but what I like [and dislike] in Bukowski I also find in Celine).Nihilism? Maybe. But black comedy seems like a better fit. Bardamu fights in the war (WWI) and excoriates military leaders, war profiteers, patriots and war itself, which doesn't seem unreasonable to me. It reminded me a bit of Joseph Heller's Catch 22 or Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five in its amused cynicism. In general this experience sets Bardamu on a path altogether against ideals, commitments and beliefs. From the war he travels to Africa, then New York, then back to study to become a (failed) doctor in Paris, and then to work in a madhouse. Bardamu, like Bukowski, loves women (though especially sex, and some say as they say about Bukowski that he is a misogynist)--he actually says he loves Molly, in New York, but almost everyone and everything else on the planet he skewers. He sides with the poor over the rich, though. He's pretty miserable at times, and admits \"loves his misery.\" But in that process I found him pretty likable and amusing.

The novel comprises the journeys of C\u00e9line's alter-ego, Ferdinand Bardemu, from a frightened and bewildered soldier in World War I to the jungles of Central Africa, the materialist and well-kept streets of a booming America, and back again to France to eke out a living as a listless doctor amongst the petty-bourgeois of the Parisian suburbs. Having early on given in to cowardice, and abandoned all traces of self-respect, Bardamu is free to marvel at the endless ways humans find to oppress, degrade, exploit and terrorize both themselves and all who come into their proximity. Filled with an abiding contempt for the poor, he has no higher opinion of the rich. Loathing the crassness, grubbiness and pervading greed of capitalist society, he yet finds himself constantly hustling to scrape up enough money to get by; blissfully immune to any spiritual beneficence of the Christian God, he endlessly worships at the altar of servile humility and abject abasement before any trace of authority; and constantly fearful of a murderous society, and absolute in his belief that it means him active harm, he cannot bring himself to reciprocate against those he encounters during his improbable journeys.However, all of C\u00e9line's caustic and withering laments cannot conceal his abiding compassion for, and amazement with, human life, and at how his fellow sufferers bravely endure and struggle on, even in the face of an eternity so deep, uncaring, impenetrable and overwhelming as to bring an absent God to His knees. This juxtaposition of sympathy and revulsion, along with enough lovely turns of phrase to supply signature quotes for life, shines through in Ralph Manheim's supple and gorgeous translation.

It is a little book, but it's quite likely to revitalize you. How many 113 page books and/or hour long lectures (the original format of this text) can say that?This is Woolf's Damn The Man book. It is of course done in an overtly polite British way... until she brings up her fountain pen and stabs them right between the eyes. She manages to make this a work of Romantic sensibility, and yet modern, piercing, and vital. Woolf was asked to give a speech on \"Women and fiction.\" She ended up with an entire philosophy on the creative spirit, though with special attention to that of women, of course. Her thesis is simply that women must have a fixed income (500 pounds a year in her time) and a room of her own with a lock on the door. It is only with independence and solitude that women will finally be free to create, after centuries of being forced to do as men please because they support them, and to work in the middle of a drawing room with a thousand practical interruptions, ten children to see to, and a sheet of blotting paper to cover the shame of wasting her time with \"scribbles,\" (as Jane Austen did whenever someone outside the family came into the room) when there was a house to keep and a family to raise. She also shows the creative powers of women tortured and hidden through the allegory of Shakespeare's sister, who never had a chance to express her genius and killed herself after being defeated at every turn.Woolf takes her readers through the history of women writers, and makes sure that the reader cannot fail to see how brief it is and how limited, and why. Woolf states that all modern women should acknowledge their ancestors who fought for five minutes and a few pieces of paper to jot down lines of Jane Eyre, Middlemarch, or Pride and Prejudice. She makes sure that women know that they can reject the framework and the form down to the very sentences that are given to them by men to find their own voice. However, this voice should be, ultimately, sexless. In her view, one should be \"man-womanly,\" or \"woman-manly,\" to write enduring classics. She doesn't let women down easy, either. The end of the book points out all the advantages young women have(/had, 1929) and yet they still don't run countries, wars, or companies, and there's no excuse for that. It's an exhortation to not squander everything the women's movement fought for. I probably could have said this in a much shorter way: \"Damn the patriarchy, find your own way and your own voice in life, seize the day, just DO something. How dare you waste the opportunities that so many others would have died to have.\"Inspiring words on any topic, I think. I think I'll keep this by my bedside to reach for when I feel discouraged or lazy or bitter about my future or my current situation in life..", "A Room of One's Own, Virginia WoolfA Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf.

Without that power probably the earth would be unknown. We should still be scratching the outlines of deer on the remains of mutton bones and bartering flints for sheep skins or whatever simple ornament took our unsophisticated taste. Supermen and Fingers of Destiny would never have existed. The Czar and the Kaiser would never have worn crowns or lost them. Whatever may be their use in civilized societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action. That is why Napoleon and Mussolini both insist so emphatically upon the inferiority of women, for it they were not inferior, they would cease to enlarge.\u201dTo think of this long essay as feminist propaganda is to do this book and the author Virginia Woolf a disservice. Desmond MacCarthy of the Sunday Times labels the book as such, but he also says, \u201dyet it resembles an almond tree in blossom.\u201d Certainly, the case can be made that MacCarthy feels a niggling of perception that the book is more than just propaganda, quite possibly something beautiful. Vincent Van Gogh certainly found blossoming almond trees to be beautiful, given the number of times he painted them. Woolf liked the review and even pasted it in her scrapbook. The expectation I had in reading this book, as I do with every Woolf book I decide to read, is that she will change my perspective or, at the very least, slightly alter my life view about something. We can all agree a pail is a pail, but if it is turned upside down, is it still a pail or does it become something else? Woolf turns ideas sideways, or tosses them up in the air so they spin around and around, or sometimes moves the reader from one vantage point to another. See this thought from down here and now from up there. It will look different. Understanding comes from expanding the mind, and presenting tired arguments with fresh insight is important.If we return to the opening quote that began this \u201creview,\u201d we can read that as an act of oppression of women being relegated to this role, or we can read it as a grand sacrifice for the greater good. If women had never been subservient to men, then civilisation as we know it would not exist. If women were as strong physically as men and did not need a man\u2019s protection, how different would things be? Has nature intentionally hampered women to create the proper dynamic for the human species to evolve into civilised creatures? Regardless of any type of grand design, we can say now that most of us do live in a civilized world and that the days of women needing to be looking-glasses is over. I believe that women are quite capable of molding the world to fit their needs without waiting for a man to do it for them. Suffragettes worked for many decades to achieve the vote. In Britain, they had that right given to them in 1918 and in the United States in 1920. Virginia Woolf emphatically says that getting the right to vote was secondary to her receiving an inheritance of 500 pounds a year from her aunt. The right to vote did not give her power over her own life, but having her own money did. She could afford a room of her own, and she could afford to be a serious writer. Of course, financial independence is important, but I\u2019d never really thought about it carrying more weight than having the right to vote. We may have seen this play out in the 2016 election when 47% of white women voted for Trump and 45% voted for Clinton. One would think that Clinton would offer these women more future advantages, but when thinking about at least the immediate future, these women who supported Trump must have felt that he offered more opportunity for a robust economy. Discounting the one issue voters who have routinely voted against their best interests for decades in the hopes of overturning Roe vs. Wade, any reasonable projection would have expected more white women to vote for Clinton. I\u2019ve believed for a long time that women could easily control the politics of this country as they did in the 2018 midterms. The interesting thing will be what will be the guiding principle for voting in 2020? If economics is the most important issue for a woman, not only for herself but for the men in her family, there is a chance that the split of the vote could be similar to 2016. This feels like a digression, but at the same time, maybe Woolf from 1929 has given me insight into what is still of most concern to women in the 21st century...striving towards economic freedom. Woolf introduces me to Aphra Behn, a playwright from the 17th century who became the first woman to make an independent living with her pen. From what I\u2019ve briefly gathered, it seems she was a woman who lived as a man would, in pursuit of her pleasures. Woolf refers to her as \u201cshady and amorous.\u201d  Behn was a true trailblazer; there is ever only one first, but once there is a first, we hope for a second and a third and a hundred more. The importance of Aphra\u2019s contribution to Woolf\u2019s own success was not lost on her. \u201dAll women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey, for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.\u201d She did make it into Westminster, but was not allowed to be buried in the Poet\u2019s corner where she belonged. Woolf talks about the economics of being a writer, about really needing to be born to a certain class to even receive an education that would allow the blossoms of creativity to be born. She talks about the androgynous mind and the writers who possessed it, such as Coleridge and Shakespeare. \u201dWhen one takes a sentence of Coleridge into the mind, it explodes and gives birth to all kinds of other ideas, and that is the only sort of writing of which one can say that it has the secret of perpetual life.\u201d Did I just hear the rattle of grinning bones from Coleridge\u2019s grave?Looking through my notes, there are so many more things that I could discuss about this book. It sounds like a heavy book, but it is made weightless by the stream of consciousness style Woolf uses. You really feel as if you are walking with her through the gardens of Fernham as she works to compose her thoughts on what women really want, what women really need, and how best to achieve happiness. She knows the importance, of course, of being oneself, and I think she has also made it very clear how difficult it is, but also how important it is for women to achieve...a room of their own.

In the last few days, I have been organizing my reading challenges for next year, and decided to get a jump start on women's history as well as a January group read in catching up on classics by reading Woolf. Although written ninety years ago, Woolf could be discussing the status of women authors today. Her work remains timely and was a pure joy to read.Mary Beton is roaming the Oxbridge University library in search of quality works written by women authors. This is the task put forth to her by her professors and she is determined to do good by her gender. Yet, as Woolf writing as Beton points out, this is no small task although she believes that Beton is up for the challenge. Until recently (in Woolf's time), women were denied access to universities as well as two necessities for writing: five hundred pounds a year in expenses and a room of one's own in which to write uninterruptedly. A woman's station in life was to take care of one's children and other housekeeping tasks. Only the rich were able to write as they had nannies to care for their children, and writing as a profession was not accessible to the average woman. The shots fired in 1914 changed the role of women in British society; however, as men went off to fight in the Great War, and women were expected to take on jobs outside of the home that were often only employed by men. The women's movement in Europe had begun, followed shortly after by women's suffrage in England in 1919. Writing ten years after these developments, Woolf points out that despite enjoying these gains in society, women still have a long way to go until they are to be considered on equal literary footing as men.Well versed in literary history, Woolf cites many examples in European literature to point out the path women have taken to get where they are in the early 20th century. She starts with an pointed anecdote: if Shakespeare had a sister. Woolf notes that in the 16th century long before the women's revolution, intelligent women would not have been encouraged in reading or writing in any shape or form. Perhaps, if this woman was intelligently inclined, she might have peeked at her brother's work. Yet, any other avenues would have been closed to her unless she possessed a rebellious streak and followed her famous brother to his Globe Theater and immersed herself in his work. With roles in plays closed off to her, she would have died a pauper in a common grave. Having no access to education, the women's space was in the home. This changed with Aphra Behn.Woolf goes on to point out that famous writers as the Brontes, Jane Austen, and Mary Shelley have Aphra Behn to thank as she was the first British woman to write as a profession. Her work may not be as famous as that of her literary descendants but it paved the way so that they could write the now classic books including Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice that are still enjoyed by many today. Woolf takes it a step further, noting that other pioneers such as George Sand and George Eliot felt safer writing under men's pseudonyms. They did so because in the early 19th century, all but a few literary avenues were still closed to women. Even Jane Austen took twenty years to become published for the first time, and women writing when she did were told that if they wrote at all, it should be as poets rather than novelists. In a pointed barb toward the establishment, Woolf notes that had these women been men, they would have been as revered throughout Europe as Tolstoy, and their work rather than War and Peace would be considered the 19th century novel.Throughout the novella, Woolf's feminism is on display. She encourages women to have less children so that they are able to do work in addition to caring for their children and housework. She also points out that by achieving higher levels of education that women should be more than capable of writing great novels. She believes that in one hundred years after the publication of her essay that the amount of books written by men and women should be about equal, reflecting on their actual percentages of the population. While this may be true today ninety years later, women still have a way to go until their classic books are read as much as those of their male counterparts. At the beginning of 2017, I had set out to read 75% of all books by women authors. The percentages fell to around 50/50, what Woolf had encouraged in this novella. As noticed in my experience, woman and men write differently and about vastly different topics, so even if I read four books in a row by women authors, I find my personal pendulum swinging back toward the men. I believe as Woolf that 50/50 is a marker to strive for as this represents an accurate percentage of society. A Room of One's Own has given me intriguing food for thought as I plan my upcoming reading year and should offer poignant discussions in a genre that still at times struggles to find quality women authors. Suffice it to say, the frustrating feeling I had from this past weekend is gone.5 stars.", "\u201cLock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.\u201d This is a highly charged feminist essay loaded with powerful rhetoric and words that demand to be heard.

The room is space, space to grow, learn and write. Creativity is the key. Far too often women didn\u2019t get the opportunity to express it and develop any form of art. \u201cA woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\u201d Woolf recognises her own advantages, the key being a fine education allowing her to become successful and financially independent. She is a rarity, and she used this as a basis to attack the patriarchy and the stupid nuances that leave women in intellectual shackles. Granted, the twentieth century saw more women writers emerge than any other century, but there were still improvements to be made. Woolf led the charge. She wanted more for every woman. Sure, you could make the case that there had been many fine female writers of fiction before Woolf. The Brontes, Austen, Eliot and Gaskell stand out as the most prominent novelists, but the point is not every women is afforded the opportunities that allow her to become a writer. If she is not educated, and given room and space, then she will never know what she could be capable of. Woolf\u2019s words are sharp and directly address the problems in realistic terms. She\u2019s not an idealist, just a pragmatist who suggests things that should not need to be suggested. Intellectual freedom is not a right, it\u2019s a necessity all should be able to attain.A compelling essay, still very relevant today!.", "***this book is calling me***\"So that when I ask you to earn money and have a room of your own, I am asking you to live in the presence of reality, an invigorating life, it would appear, whether one can impart it or not.\"...She sounds like my long lost soul.\"Women are hard on women.

She meant to write this book on women and writing looking back when women would not even dare to think about it. She goes to the library and make notes on this but like me, she's good at losing track of her own thoughts (but comes back to them nevertheless).I wouldn't declare myself a hardcore feminist nor would I pretend to be someone who has read lots of important literature and all the books in the entire world's library collections to judge this book in the form of writing a critical review or any kind of arguments on the contents of this book. Feminism to me is still a subjective matter and I consider myself as someone who is still ignorant and has too less knowledgeable when it comes to it. As for the authors and the writers in history who Virginia Woolf had made references in the book, I would say the same. I am still ignorant about these authors and writers or their works and lives. I haven't read much of classics yet. And I do feel it's would be pretty petty of me to argue about the statements and the arguments made in this book. And for that matter, I feel I would not even rate such books as such books are based on the writers' opinions. As by now, I know It's futile if I try to judge someone else's opinion. Discussion and arguing on a matter is one thing, trying to prove someone else's opinion doesn't do me any good.So when I started reading this book, I was just curious about how Virginia Woolf wrote. I didn't look up the premise or anything regarding this book. The first book that I tried reading was To The Lighthouse. I wasn't just into it. I left it after struggling myself to read 3 pages or so. This book was thought provoking and rather stimulating for me. The enthusiasm in her writing showed. Just as we readers have strong opinions on the books we have read, she was one such reader who had strong opinions on the lack of writings by women authors. So many a time, I felt like she was indicating that women were not writing because of the ridiculousness of everyone during those times in the past that women shouldn't even dream about writing. Their only existence should revolve around homekeeping and bearing children. I would say there's a fair chance of that but nevertheless, I would not rather just believe whatever explanations and possible reasons that were written in this book. Most of the records and scripts of the past might not have been recorded or kept safe. Who knows? But yes, I do believe women have been focusing all their lives on mere household keeping and everything mundane things to keep the children and men do as they please. I would say it's still happening and I am aware of it every single waking moment of my everyday normal life. Fair points have been made. Even if I say so, I am not confident enough to say so because I haven't read those authors and their work. So I would stay open to first becoming familiar to these and make a comment later on. Some parts are just mere ramblings I would say. And even if I haven't read everything by Jane Austen, not a single book by Charlotte Bront\u00eb or by George Eliot, I feel it was rather distasteful in my opinion to compare their writings over one another. I felt like Charlotte Bront\u00eb was her favourite amongst these few women writers in history, she was almost bashing other women writers for whatever they had written and hinting that their writings were somewhat inferior in comparison. Her opinion. But the Jane Austen lover in me got a bit insulted. Subjective opinions of different readers. Fair point.There are six chapters in all. The first chapter is very, very easy to get into. I am glad I picked up this book as my first completed read by the author. Her fiction works doesn't sync with my reading. I will give them a try later on. But her non-fiction, essays are really easy to get into. The first chapter is rather chaotic in my opinion. Then followed the rest of the chapters following the works of fiction mostly by prominent men writers in history and giving her opinions on why there was a total lack of women writers during those periods. My least favourite chapter was the 5th one. I do respect her general opinions on everything else but I still find it rather outrageous to focus on just one female writer of the past who she probably thought had inferior writing skills. That chapter made the book less interesting for me. Her opinions might be general. But I just couldn't see the point of bashing one author. And we all know that writers are different and their work will be different from the rest. We just cannot force our opinions on some specific writers to write something we consider better work. My most favourite part of the book was the last chapter!I would just reread that chapter again and again. If I happen to reread this book one day, I would be satisfied just reading the last chapter of this book. It expresses well the writer's opinion on both the sexes, valuable thoughts on what could make a difference in the lives of women in general if we are self-sufficient and have means to provide for ourselves rather than depending on others and keep writing without the fears and apprehension that we women tend to have.(Why am I writing so much?! Stop.)Virginia might come and judge if I don't write, I told myself. She wanted us women to write..", "First thing I'd like to say is I wish I could keep Virginia Woolf alive for all eternity so as to read her thoughts on other writers.

My favourite parts of this book, reminding me of my love for The Common Reader, a handbook for how to write a creative review if ever there was one, were often when she discusses the female writers who came before her. Some fabulous insights on Austen (of all great writers she is the most difficult to catch in the act of greatness) and Charlotte Bronte in particular. How I'd love to know what she makes of all her female successors.  Of course the world is now full of women with a room of their own and as a result there are probably as many good female writers out there as men now. But then a doubt arises. If, as she has it, potential geniuses have been denied a voice by social injustices in the past, surely now our emancipated western world ought to be brimming with them? But wasn't Virginia herself the last female literary genius? And didn't the 19th century produce four female geniuses? I'm struggling to think of any contemporary female novelist (or male) who can indisputably match Eliot, Austen and the two Brontes for artistry or innovation. And we're still waiting for a female Shakespeare. Perhaps the central premise of Woolf's argument, when applied to creativity, is a bit flawed. Perhaps adversity is a much more inspiring impetus than leisure, encouragement or freedom. After all, there's little doubt Woolf's genius owed more to the deeply troubled nature of her mind than to having a room of her own in which to write. Then again, thank heavens she did have a room of her own in which to write. And thank heavens we all have a room of our own in which to write.  This was originally written as a lecture for the young women at Girton College. Which is why her argument is focused on the patriarchal outlawing of artistic creativity in women and doesn't broach upon wider issues of male persecution of women. Personally, I've never attended a lecture that hasn't at times released my mind to go wandering and this was very much true for me here - even though it's perhaps one of the events in history I'd choose to attend given a fairystory choice of ten. There's a lot of beating around the bush. Frequently she did snap me back to attention with some glistening pearl of wisdom but for the most part I detected in this book, much more than in her novels, a hint of why a lot of people simply don't connect with Woolf. This I'd say is an inclination on her part to get carried away with her flights of whimsy. I think writing Orlando, pure (and mostly fabulous) whimsy, was her recognising this trait in herself and bringing it under better control. The outcome, three years later, was her masterpiece, The Waves. No doubt this was much more electrifying at its time. Especially perhaps it's passages on the essentially androgynous nature of the human mind. Nowadays, it belongs for me among her lesser books.

Or to sum up in a few measly paragraphs, a book that may just have shattered into a million pieces all my illusions about the art of writing and reshaped my whole perspective.Have you ever imagined a disembodied voice whispering into your ears, the wisdom of the ages as you flipped through the pages of a book? how often have you conjured up the vision of the writer talking to you, teaching you, humoring you and coaxing you to open your mind to newer things as you read a book? Have you felt a book stop being just a book somewhere and instead appear as a beacon of enlightenment that shines down the light of knowledge upon your darkened, ignorant soul? This is how profoundly A Room of One's Own affected me.I will adopt this book as my writing Bible. I will read this every time I feel dejected, sad or terribly lost. And I will read this again and again, until I can ascertain that the message, the very spirit of this fine piece of writing has been assimilated into the core of my being. Okay now that I've gotten the stream of incoherent gushing out of the way, let me try and bestow on this review some semblance of real meaning.It will be irreverent of me to call A Room of One's Own a mere essay or something that grew out of a lecture given at Girton College, Cambridge. This is the essence of Virginia Woolf herself, captured at the peak of her glory, all within 111 pages. This is Woolf reaching out from within the confines of this book and handing out to you the precious fruits of years of her hard work - her thoughts, her research, her observations, her inferences, her views. So what if it is about the subject of women? and writing? Aren't women one half of the human race? The so-called better half at that. What is so wrong about getting to know about the history of their evolution as thinkers, as composers, as sentient beings with the power of expression but without the power to assert themselves?So you better read it. Yes you, the silently scoffing and judging member of the 'stronger' sex. Yes you too. Because it does not only talk about women writers but life itself and the art of writing.The blurb and the countless reviews famously identify this book as one of the greatest feminist polemics of the last century. I beg to differ. It will be unfair to tag it with the label of a polemic - a word with a highly negative connotation. Because Virginia Woolf's aim, instead, was to dispel all forms of negativity from the vocation of writing. Sure, she gives us the feminist side of things - but her voice is not full of seething rage or resentment but balanced, logical, sardonic and even humorous at times.This is Woolf's homage to the spirit of those unsung heroines of the distant past who may have written poems, songs and ballads but were forced to adopt anonymity simply because it was unacceptable for a woman to write. Those imaginative souls who may have wanted desperately to write but could not because society thrust gender specific roles of the mother and wife on them and did not even bother educating them.What if Shakespeare had an equally talented sister but who could never be another Shakespeare herself because she would have been mocked at had she expressed a desire to write plays or poetry? Woolf asks us to spare a moment and reflect on the sad fate of these martyrs, history has not bothered to record.\"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even of a very remarkable man who had a mother, then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen, some Emily Bront\u00eb who dashed her brains out on the moor or mopped and mowed about the highways crazed with the torture that her gift had put her to. Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without singing them, was often a woman.\"She makes it clear to us that Jane Austen was a clever, clever writer because she never tried to adopt the style of a man's writing or his sentence construction. She created her own. And with a rather limited range of experiences in the real world at her command, she could neither have written about bloody wars nor about politics - spheres women still hadn't earned the right to enter. Instead she wrote what she saw and witnessed in the sitting chambers of the houses of the gentry. (This rekindles my interest in Jane Austen which had started to wane over the past few years.)She also repeatedly stresses on how a woman needs a room of her own and money to be able to write. A room of her own because she needs a breathing space where she could revel in the knowledge of her identity as a person, as a woman, as a thinker over her identity as a dutiful daughter or wife or mother. Although I disagree with her assertion of having money as a necessary criterion for aiming to become a writer, I think financial independence could have been a metaphor for empowerment of women or a reference to freedom from having to rely on someone else, especially a man, and to be able to decide the course of your own life.Woolf ends her essay by exhorting both men and women to take up their pens and write, laying emphasis on the necessity of stepping outside the limits of narrow gender identities and be the writer with an androgynous mind instead - the one capable of uniting the spirit of both the man and woman and letting it reflect in one's craft.And it is at this point, I felt truly thankful for her 500 pounds a year and a room of her own. Since that may have, after all, allowed this marvelous, deeply enlightening piece of writing to come into existence in the first place..", "The true pressure one finds themselves in when writing a review can be really taxing.

Especially when you are an amateur writer and still unable to truly put to words what is felt inside. Virginia Woolf is one of the greatest feminist authors out there. No, the correct manner to express who she truly is by telling that she was one of the foremost feminists at a time the word feminism was growing. A Room of One\u2019s Own is not her most celebrated works but it is among some of her best. Since the day I chanced upon a newsletter of a women\u2019s society I\u2019ve been following that had an extract from this wonderful novel, I have been dying to read this. I\u2019ve been pulling apart bookshops in my area looking for it and finally managed to find myself a copy in Colombo. In all honesty I had been counting down minutes till I got back home to start on it. Although in a sense that this letter is contextually more appropriate for a time passed by with many progressive steps taken into the freedom of women, in our little pearl of an island, many of the core elements in it, does still resonate. One of the main reasons is the position of women as a whole in Sri Lanka is miles behind that of other countries and whilst reading this novel, a part of me that I did not know I possessed, awakened. It is not that I was suddenly motivated to go around spreading feminist agendas but rather that I should take a stand against myself, the amount of patriarchal notions that have been inbred to me should be dropped and that as a woman I should look at myself as a human being that deserves as much as the my male colleague sitting next to me at work. At one glance it would seem I am sprouting some utter nonsense because of the sense of capitulation I have been forcing upon myself. There are many aspects and themes of this book that could be discussed for an immense amounts of time. Woolf was an author thinking beyond her era. I myself am a huge fan of Jane Austen and the points that Woolf had broached while researching for this, shines a new light for everything. As I have mentioned before, although many of them have been successfully somewhat addressed, here in Sri Lanka and South Asia in general women are still facing them. The ability for women to reach a certain level accomplishment is always foreshadowed with them being labeled as money hoarders or apathetic women. One might ask why I used the word apathetic rather than any other here but that is stemming from the fact that few hours before I got home from work I was listening to a conversation of few people in the line of the supermarket and the manner in which they were describing this one woman in Sri Lanka that gained popularity these few days for standing up to cause was generally of that sense. Are women who strive to achieve something unemotional? Not looking at their families? Are women only to look after children and make sure the man gets his dinner on the table at the proper time? Many of those who read my review will say that this era of women is long passed. Sadly it is not, if one would look at families in Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Middle Eastern, this pattern has not yet dissolved away. Women around the world are oppressed. What are we as women still doing? If anyone who knows me personally would say I myself am not a great orator or someone who would do something to change a person\u2019s life but what I have learnt through this is the first steps should be taken by ourselves. Within us. If we do not start at the proper beginning we might end up not reaching the true ending. So the real question is, how far have we come since the day Woolf imparted this letter to the women at Cambridge to 2020 when I am writing this review? In a sense what Woolf mentioned in the novel is true. This cannot be achieved at once. It is a slow process, but for each slow process, the more gears that are added, which are well oiled, the faster the machine may work. But we should know that we should not add too much or the wheels will spin out of order and we might end up with a broken machine.  \u201cTherefore I would ask you to write all kinds of books. Hesitating at no subject however trivial or however vast. By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourself of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the street.\u201d  In lieu for the International Women\u2019s Day that has passed, I can respond firmly for the question that we have indeed come far since the days of Woolf but still not far enough. Yet it\u2019s always a constant question in my head, at what cost have we come here? For a parade of \u201cInstagram selfie queens\u201d? I am quite sure this is not the freedom envisioned by Woolf. It is not that I ask you to keep me in a throne but it is that I implore you to let me eat from the same table as you..", "Mundane though it may be I couldn\u2019t help thinking throughout this little gem of a book that I\u2019m being reacquainted, this time in stunning English prose, with a thought that had been drilled into me ever since I became aware of the real world.

The thought had been communicated in practical every day language, not the least bit literary but urgent to be heard nevertheless. It was this: money, the luxury of owing it and the capacity to earn it in order to support one\u2019s self, is indispensable to freedom, self-expression and self-preservation. Both my grandmothers, born a decade or two later than Woolf, had neither rooms nor money of their own and when they were her age at the time she wrote this (40) the idea that such commodities were achievable was out of reach for them here in the European South. My mother, on the other hand, was among the few of her social environment to manage having both, however modest. Her rural family couldn\u2019t provide her with a dowry other than a state-funded practical education that secured her an urban job and a freedom that must have seemed exotic to her fellow village girls. My own middle-class upbringing gave me the privilege of choice between academia or a respectably-paying job. And my daughters are luckily living lives that enable them to act and think in ways their great-grandmothers wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of.One of those grandmothers was illiterate, the other was allowed to complete grammar school, they probably wouldn\u2019t have known what to make of this book\u2019s inspired train of thought had it miraculously found its way to them. My mother can\u2019t read the English original but she has earned the right to read and know what to make of her readings. I\u2019m going to find a nice Greek translation and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll feel the meaning of the text to her bones. Myself, I\u2019m fortunate enough to have the room, time, knowledge and empathy to properly appreciate both the beauty of Woolf\u2019s language and the brilliance of her arguments. My girls have all the above but perhaps lack the empathy, having grown up in a society where what Woolf describes as women\u2019s burning desires are taken for granted \u2013 at least in some parts of this world. I can only wish that it will be curiosity and not a sense of having joined the club that will one day lead them to it; the English text of course \u2013 this goes without saying for their generation. Now all this says next to nothing about the book itself (but maybe not). It says something about where Woolf\u2019s sisters were, are and hopefully will be; I\u2019d like to think she would have smiled at the thought of just that..", "If a book can stir you, teach you, and guide you as a woman and as a writer, none would do a better job than  A Room of One's Own.

The book or rather the essay contains Virginia Woolf's famous quote \"a woman must have money and room of her own if she is to write fiction\". Throughout the essay, she emphasizes her point drawing many examples of women writers in comparison to their counterparts. When I dig deep into her meaning of the above quotation, I found that Virginia doesn't mean only about having money and privacy to write. Although monetary independence is stressed, there are more subtle and pressing issues she has addressed under the guise of that quotation. It was also a pleasant surprise to read her view on the psychology of male and female authors. \"....in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female; and in the man's brain man predominates over the woman, and in the woman's brain woman predominates the man. The normal and comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony together, spiritually co-operating. If one is a man, still the woman part of his brain must have effect; and a woman also must have intercourse with the man in her.\" This opened my eyes through a new window. What Virginia Woolf tries to emphasize here is that every human has two sides irrespective of the accepted sex. In a man, there lives a woman to a degree, and in a woman, there lives a man to a degree. But when they combine emotionally, a brilliant product sees the light of the day. Although Virginia has spoken entirely about writing, I could not stop but wonder how truly applicable this principle is to every aspect of human life. This short book was both informative and educative for women in all capacity, especially women writers but also for men. This is no feminine text. The use of such a narrow description belittles this well-researched masterpiece. I, as both a woman and writer, was left utterly shaken. My perspective with regard to fiction, authors, and writing will never again be the same. I also figured out certain elements I lack as a writer to which I should give deep thought and careful attention. And I express my heartfelt gratitude to Virginia Woolf for this brilliant masterpiece which would certainly change me both as a woman and a writer.********************************************After this third read, I pondered more on Virginia Woolf's contemplation on what would have happened if Shakespeare had a sister with equal genius. Virginia is absolutely sure that in the 17th century if a woman of the equal genius of Shakespeare had attempted to do what he did, either she must have been ruined or become a castaway. Many centuries have passed from that time to which she alludes. But looking at modern society, I wonder whether we have come much far from that position. Of course, more and more women produce fiction, write plays, poetry, and compose music; so in that sense women of our time come far from their sisters of the 17th century. But as a whole, and comparatively, have women been able to conquer all these areas as equally as men? Haven't they still being weighed down by either domestic responsibility or prejudice? Virginia Woolf's observations, made in the early 20th century, still ring true to a greater extent..", "Fascinating and influential feminist theories but slow and tiresome in getting to the point", "Once, I loved Virginia Woolf.

Yes, you can finally write because you don't have to cook dinner. But someone else is doing so, and Woolf is quite, quite clear that feminism means liberation for some women. Not for all.Here is the most divisive form of identity politics. Here is an egregious example of sneering ivory tower intellectualism. I understand now why her books left me depressed - her philosophy, however prettily it dresses itself up, is vanity. It asks nothing of us, but it does demand a whole lot from the universe in order to preen and gaze at itself. Woolf lost me for good with her astounding disdain for the plight of anyone outside her narrow demographic. Women should have space and time of their own - all women. All men. Regardless of class. And if Woolf could only write literature with an army of servants to abuse at her every whim, then I'm frankly certain I have nothing of value to learn from her. Of course she was terrible to her servants. In a room of one's own, there is no place for empathy with those carrying the weight outside..", "I would give 6 stars if I could.

Avatars of the Gauri.Of course, I didn\u2019t know they were so, and I didn't want to find out. I knew Woolf was perfectly capable of inventing novelists and novels inside this small thought-world she was spinning.What is their purpose in this fictional essay? They serve as demonstrations. Of writers who could have been, if only certain conditions had been met. Of the many literary geniuses lost to humankind because it was so late in letting the women into literature.And what would have allowed this?Woolf examines the minimum material preconditions that would be required before genuinely self-representative literature can emerge from among the women. According to her this requires enough money, leisure and solitude -- and they should be earned (?) and should come with no attachments. Only then can women start producing literature of their own that is not defined by their relations to men. Woolf considers Austen as the best example of such a completely free feminine literature (for contrast, consider Shakespeare as a genuinely human representation of self) i.e. a true representation of the female self, untainted by anger towards the male attitudes, frustration arising from limited opportunities, fear of social repercussions, wariness of what is expected of a women, and so on.After much reflection and survey of literature and its origins, etc., Woolf comes back to the original point that material conditions are all important.This is something we can agree to. And we can share in the sense of loss that pervades this book. But we need not stop there\u2026Extending The Argument: The Productions of ExclusionWoolf\u2019s exploration is about women\u2019s literature, but I am sure we can extend the scope of the essay a bit beyond that.We should be able to go so far as to tell that the material conditions of any group more or less determines its literary output:1. A leisurely class with plenty of time and education can create and consume subtle and philosophical literature and art.2. A working class which is barely literate, does not have time for leisurely study and starved for quick entertainment will produce and consume crasser types of pop-art, barely going beyond the most cliched levels such as crude comics and perhaps the movies.3. In between, might be the service-economy middle classes who have a bit of education -- required to appreciate moderate doses of art, and can afford the time and energy for producing and consuming genre fiction, YA, etc.So each class develops its tastes and consumption habits based on its unique material conditions\u2026 That is quite Marxist of us, isn\u2019t it?Any group denied this material basis is denied of literature too, as postulated by Woolf for the feminine in her essay. And, as we have seen, each group is denied literature and art to the extent that it is denied material comforts and leisure.Thus we can extend Woolf\u2019s speculative pathos and be sad about how many varieties of literary perspectives are lost to us even today due to such exclusion\u2026As I said, in Woolf\u2019s analysis it is the women who are the victim to this unfair exclusion. But today, perhaps, in many countries women are not so materially backward anymore. That does not, of course, make Woolf\u2019s essay outdated, since it is only a way of looking at literature \u2014 both in its conditions for creation as well as consumption.In fact, I would now like not only extend Woolf\u2019s propositions, but invert them a bit \u2014 to propose that we can even apply the conditions of material repression to the men of today. Women are freer to pursue non-material careers today \u2014 the stigma has been removed and the requisite (500 pounds?) material conditions are easier to come by. Whereas men find it harder.For instance, consider how much easier it is for a woman to go into a career in humanities. For a man to do the same would be much more difficult (note that this reviewer speaks only from the limited perspective of his own social experience of the educational aspirations prevalent in a third world country).Why ?Because societal norms expects man to be the provider \u2014 hence he should not be seen going into careers which are known to be of questionable monetary value, with little or no employment prospects.This is, perhaps, especially true in a patriarchal society like what we still have in India, and probably not as much applicable in the west \u2014 I do not really know. Hopefully a few comments from varying cultural milieus will help us pin this down.All this shouldn\u2019t be taken to be only about production of literature \u2014 production is always in a tangled feed-back loop with consumption as far as arts are concerned. And the same is true for consumption too, i.e., for general reading. It is the women who seems to predominate reading in India. And as an experiment, if you would take one look at the \u2018top reviewers\u2019 listings in India, you will see that it is dominated by women too. Men are not supposed to \u201cwaste their time\u201d reading and talking about books. They have manly tasks to attend to, like selling soaps and making financial instruments.And in keeping with this, of all my friends, the ones who are trained in humanities, especially literature, philosophy, etc., predominantly tend to be women. And those men who genuinely have an interest in literature and art tend to be in a process of self-education (including me) \u2014 stumbling and searching for a sure path, with no formal training or critical education. Hence it is much harder for those men to then be able to compete with the trained women (whether in creation of literary products or of literary markets, through their reading preferences) \u2014 with more time on her hands and a room of her own too, now. It might be that the cultural world is being remade in the image of Eve, or Gauri, and perhaps it is a good thing too. .", "Gripping and modern take on privilege and feminism - 4.5 stars rounded upSome of the most inspired words, some of the most profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read, could scarcely spell and was the property of her husband.An essay, non-fiction...A poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of which great writings are born.

That is it. Intellectual freedom depends upon material things.I am on a roll this year with Virginia Woolf and she keeps surprising me positively.A Room of One's Own is an edited essay based on a series of speeches held by Woolf. She tackles women and fiction (and already concludes the following at the start of the book: I have shirked the duty of coming to a conclusion upon these two questions - women and fiction remain, so far as I am concerned, unsolved problems), but in the end I think the main topic is privilege.The impact of privilege is brilliantly illustrated by the fictional life of Judith Shakespeare, the every bit as talented sister to the playwright who, by being a woman would have been treated immensely different in her contemporary England. This thought expirement of Woolf made me think of the following webcomic in terms of clarity and insightfulness:https://www.boredpanda.com/privilege-...How women are written about by men but not the other way around is also tackled heads on by Woolf. She describes how wealth together with being free from childcare, and the time this gives, offers the opportunity for creating art (Money dignifies what is frivolous if unpaid for).In one sentence she captures all this most eloquently:Suppose, for instance, that men were only represented in literature as the lovers of women, and were never the friends of men, soldiers, thinkers, dreamers - how few parts in the plays of Shakespeare could be allotted to them; how literature would suffer!...and the spark of fiction we know from the novels of WoolfFiction here is likely to contain more truth than fact.And don't be fooled: Virginia Woolf even in an essay brings scenes to live with incredible clarity.The start of Chapter VI, with the vibrancy of everyday London, reminded me of Mrs. Dalloway while the quick steps through history and reflections on gender closely link to Orlando, completed only one year earlier.At the start of the book she whisks us away to an autumn day in Oxbridge, where you see the lightfal, taste the partridge in the luncheon (because: One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well), feel her anger at being denied to a library which she can\u2019t visit without a man.I could not stop falling for her wit and sharpness. How she describes effortlessly, through one seemingly everyday afternoon, the centuries of women been denied the means to found colleges and to start scholarships, and are still restricted.She ends brilliantly by asking her audience to not let themselves be tied to gender, to embrace the androgynous nature of the mind and use all of the opportunities the past 10 years (after suffrage was achieved in 1919) has opened up to women.It\u2019s like a brilliant version of the message Mary Beard from a classical historical perspective investigated in Women and power, and I was left once more deeply impressed by Virginia Woolf her talent and the relevancy of her 1929 work to the 2020 MeToo world..", "May be if \u2018i\u2019 were androgynous, had five hundred a year and a good lock on my own room, \u2018i\u2019 would be able to write a truly fabulous review of this already well reviewed book.

Sitting on the riverside in front of locked gates of universities and libraries, Woolf observes the reflections of weeping willows and uncrossable bridges flowing in streams of blurred ideas and slippery thoughts while she traces back the river of history and gauges the impact of the patriarchal heritage on women\u2019s intellectual independence and their ability to create works of art. Woolf wonders how much greater the works of Jane Austen or The Bront\u00eb Sisters might have been if they had owned a room of their own, a desk where to write in privacy or had they been granted with unleashed freedom to devote to the creative process. Woolf wonders how prolific female writers might have turned out to be hadn\u2019t they been expected to behave as magnifying mirrors of their masculine companions. \"Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.\u201d (p.31) And isn\u2019t that precisely what Mrs. Ramsay or Mrs. Dalloway did?Initially researched for lectures presented to the Arts Society at Newnham and Girton College in 1928, A Room of One's Own is more than just a feminist essay about the influence of sexual discrimination in the production of literary fiction, which is evident in the lack of published works by female authors since the beginning of times. What in my opinion makes this text a pulsating masterpiece, a hymn to the art of writing and a tribute to the passion for reading, is Woolf\u2019s quest to find the binding essence that unites the writer\u2019s source of inspiration, his integrity and his power of vision with the catharsis that occurs in the inner being of the reader when an unbreakable and almost miraculous bond is created between them, arising above gender, prejudice or the burden of history. Only words are left. Words as bearers of truth that carry the ethos of human beings, whose sexual quality is of no consequence as long as their voices sound true to themselves.Words as incandescent torches that illuminate the most hidden cavities of the reader\u2019s soul, impregnating all its profundities and shallows with unimpeded brightness, soaking it with glowing clarity.Words as cords of communion between reader and writer, uniting fiction and reality. \"But this is what I have always felt and known and desired! And one boils over with excitement, and shutting the book even with a kind of reverence as if it were something very precious, a stand-by to return to as long as one lives, one puts it back on the shelf.\u201d (p.63)But for the written word to achieve that unbreakable blending of the souls, the male and female voices need to sing together, need to spiritually cooperate, need to fuse and to nurture each other to compose the complete symphony in the orchestra of the writer\u2019s mind and achieve the adequate balance of androgyny which will sprout in prodigious writing that contains the secret of perpetual life, defying the passage of time and the erosion of bigotry. \"It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness. There must be freedom and there must be peace.\u201d (p.89) Woolf\u2019s appears at the peak of her geniality merging her impressionist techniques of interior multiple monologues and stream of consciousness to deliver a double-edged essay, pungent with latent criticism and dry witted satire but also honeyed with delicious metaphors and vivid imagery.A Room of one\u2019s own has been mostly recognized for its undeniable feminist tone and for Woolf\u2019s poignant belief that women need economic independence to develop their creativity. She defends her plight based on irrefutable proofs provided by a literary map of female writers that she unfalteringly outlines, with uncanny taste and virtuous skill, throughout history.\u201dIntellectual freedom depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time.\u201d (p.93)But, in my opinion, what made a piece of art of this essay is Woolf\u2019s use of unmatchable poetic and fluid quality of language, which flows following the most intricate stretches of the history of literature, to portray the sacred act of reading as a way of understanding reality through fiction, as the conduit to inner fulfillment, as a catharsis of the senses, as a magical brewery which distillates life from its very essence, as the path to relate not only to the world of men or women, but to a world bared of its superficialities where only words carry the elixir of true meaning..", "A most interesting piece now almost a hundred years old, but still totally relevant. I would suspect Woolf might be pleased with the progress that has been made in investing women into certain high profile professions like law or medicine or politics or education; and that she would probably be quite disappointed with the social and economic handicaps still imposed by primitive and outdated male prejudices.", "I hadn't really made up my mind about how I feel about Virginia Woolf, until now, that is.

The book also talks about how literature as an art wasn't exactly encouraged back in the day, both for men and for women.

When Woolf was asked to talk about women and fiction, she chose to focus on the poverty and subjugation of women in a patriarchy.  \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\"What was astounding to me about reading this book, which was first published in 1929, is how relevant it still is today. I've heard female colleagues complain about not having time to write because of family and childhood obligations. This problem is only \"new\" in the sense that at least women have the opportunity to be educated -- it used to be they weren't even taught how to read and write.One of my favorite stories in this book is about Shakespeare's sister. As Woolf imagines it, the sister is believed to have been as talented as William, but she has no opportunities for education or expression. Instead, she is urged to marry young so she won't be a burden to her family.  \"Now my belief is that this poet who never wrote a word and was buried at the cross\u2013roads still lives. She lives in you and in me, and in many other women who are not here to\u2013night, for they are washing up the dishes and putting the children to bed. But she lives; for great poets do not die; they are continuing presences; they need only the opportunity to walk among us in the flesh.\"Truly, there are so many remarkable passages in this book that I could retype the entire essay.

Woolf was accompanied by Vita Sackville-West when she delivered the lectures and there were coded messages throughout. She defended Rebecca West, who had been attacked by Desmond MacCarthy and talked quite directly (for the time) about lesbianism. This was pertinent because the furore over Radclyffe Hall was still quite recent and Woolf explains her own, more careful approach.

I always carry a book with me, like a good bibliophile but thought it was completely inappropriate to bring a book titled \"The Age of Atheists\" to a meeting that might be a life changer. Surprisingly yes, we are still living in era where prejudice against your beliefs/ideals or lack of might affect your final outcome or give a wrong impression of the real human you are, we all are. So I decide to finish that one later at home. Anyways, I decide to stop at a close coffee place that has a nice short stack of books and I find Virginia's Woolf \"A room of one's own\". Alright! I think. I get my self a cup of black fresh coffee and make Woolf my companion on this wait.To my surprise, instead of finding an endless waititing time full of anxiety and a repetitive practice on my head of the speech and words I've prepared to say, I get lost and travel back in time to find a friend in Virginia Woolf who lifted my spirits and encouraged me through the powerful and beautiful use of words in her book.On this reading, the author defends that a woman in order to be able to sit down and write, \u201cA woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\", she requires her space and a stable economic status, free of distractors and stressful situations in order to accomplish that goal. She also gives examples of women writers back in time to support her argument (Jane Austen, George Elliot among others).Today we stand in a different era, where women are allowed not only to write but study/work and be a mother/wife at the same time, where she doesn't really need a man who doesn't even love only in order to support her economically but more a life companion to share her goals and failures and who to love by choice. \u201cAnything may happen when womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation.\u201d Our dreams today are not to have \"a white wedding\" anymore but to be successful in our careers as writers, doctors, lawyers, etc. at the same time we love and raise a family.Perhaps we don't need strictly \"A room of one's own\" anymore to keep conquering our goals not only in writing (unfortunately we might need the money still on this structured economy in which you are according to what you got and ironically necessary for education in order to work), but women continue succeeding in different fields, learning to be a \"multitask human\" through organization. Besides competitiveness get tougher each year, so we must learn to adapt instead of waiting for a perfect environment to settle around us ideally like the authors implies. Women don't need to hide their work anymore behind a male pseudonym and are more free to express an opinion and take the decisions that will lead her future. Maybe this essay was intended for writers only, but I could hear the feminist voice in Virginia Woolf reaching out to us and inspiring us.Yes Virginia, I will remember \"Shakespeare's sister\" Judith, and will give her the opportunity she perhaps lacked due to the conditions of her time. I will let her live in me and inspire me to keep working on those goals I still need to accomplish. I apologize my friends if you dont find a well and deep thought review of this book but a 2cent moment of inspiration. I just felt like sharing my morning with Virginia Woolf. This is why I love to read, it is through the brilliant minds of these authors of our past and present that we find the encouragement, the wisdom, the words we need to keep on going as well as an invitation to make a reflection of who we are and where are we standing today and what still needs to be done, individually, as a genre or as a society. Today I found freedom of my mind and confidence in myself through \"A room of one's own\", an essay published back in 1929.Now excuse me because I have an important meeting to attend....\"Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.\u201d .", "Words I've lived by long before reading this book: Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.Oh, Virginia Woolf.

She edited and added to it afterwards. However, it still bears the traces of a live performance. It must have been inspiring to hear it in person.The Four MarysAt a metafictional level, an author, Virginia Woolf, is physically speaking. However, her narrator is someone else, Mary Hamilton, arguably one of the four Marys from the ballad of the same name:\"\u2018I\u2019 is only a convenient term for somebody who has no real being...(call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please \u2014 it is not a matter of any importance).\"Well, perhaps, it is of no historical importance, when it comes to kings and queens, but it is important in the historical progress of women.The essay is partly about the ability of women to write themselves back into history and literature, whether as authors or narrators. Obviously, it's also about the ability of women to write about female (and male) characters from the different perspective that they bring to the study:\"Lies will flow from my lips, but there may perhaps be some truth mixed up with them...\"Women and FictionWoolf offers her audience an amalgam of both fiction and non-fiction, just as she invites them to become writers of whatever subject matter:\"If you would please me \u2014 and there are thousands like me \u2014 you would write books of travel and adventure, and research and scholarship, and history and biography, and criticism and philosophy and science.\"Ostensibly, the title of her talk was \"Women and Fiction\".Her one piece of advice on that topic was:\"...a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction...\"How much money did a writer need? What could you do with it? Well, in 1928, she calculated:\"Five hundred pounds a year will keep one alive in the sunshine...By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.\" I haven't been able to work out whether 500 pounds is closer to $12,000 or $40,000 per annum now. However, this happened to be the amount of a legacy that she had supposedly received from her [fictional?] Aunt Mary Beton (the name of one of the \"four Marys\").Pen MoneyIt's been inferred that this was Woolf's way of saying that, in order to write, you had to be independently wealthy.This is quite the opposite of what she implied. She frequently talks about women \"earning\" the money that sustains them. She envisaged that writers would either have a day job or would earn the required amount from their writing.They would transition from the \"pin money\" given to them by their parents to \"pen money\" generated from their own writing.There were no limits. That time had already passed:\"If there must be at this moment some two thousand women capable of earning over five hundred a year in one way or another, you will agree that the excuse of lack of opportunity, training, encouragement, leisure and money no longer holds good.\"Her audience was, after all, studying at Cambridge.Don't Give Up Your Day Job?Woolf brings a degree of optimism to the ambition to write. She wanted more women to write, so she and we could read more writing by women, and women could say what needed to be said.However, she doesn't seem to recognise the demands that work itself places on the potential writer. How can you write at night and on the weekends, if you've already worked a full week at your day job? Perhaps she anticipated that you could kill two birds with one stone, by earning your income from writing from the outset?This is a difficult enough task for a single woman. The challenges for a woman with a family were/are even greater:\"How many women had children before they were twenty-one; what, in short, they did from eight in the morning till eight at night.\"A Room of One's OwnThis is part of the reason for the second limb of her advice (and the title of her book), that a woman needs a room of her own.Women, like men, lived in the family home. There was relatively little privacy. Few, except the patriarch of a wealthy family, could enjoy the luxury of a study. A drawing room or sitting room had to be shared with the rest of the family:\"...to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof room, was out of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble, even up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.\"There was no prospect of a \"separate lodging which, even if it were miserable enough, sheltered them from the claims and tyrannies of their families.\"A Solitary WomanSo far, Woolf's advice addresses practical issues, the reality of a woman writing.Her aim was to get women writing, by telling them what was required. However, to some extent, her advice applies equally to men. Anybody who wants to write, female or male, has to have some source of income, either from their own labour or that of their partner.Besides, the solitary and private nature of writing means that they frequently have to turn their back on their family. It's OK to have a room of one's own. However, you have to be prepared to close the door on a world that arguably should be your first priority (whatever the gender of the writer parent). Men might find this easier. Women would find it difficult to achieve without a supportive partner or a considerable amount of guilt.Woolf is concerned most of all with the reality of the life of a writer. It's this world into which she invites her audience:\"When I ask you to earn money and have a room of your own, I am asking you to live in the presence of reality, an invigorating life, it would appear, whether one can impart it or not.\"The Androgynous WriterThis concern with reality extends to what women write about and how they write about it.For all its intrinsic feminism, it seems that Woolf didn't think that women needed to write radically differently from men (which is not to say that all men wrote the way she thought they could or should).Woolf advances a theory about the androgynous writer, which is analogous to the views of Coleridge.She asks whether:\"...there are two sexes in the mind corresponding to the two sexes in the body, and whether they also require to be united in order to get complete satisfaction and happiness?\"And I went on amateurishly to sketch a plan of the soul so that in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female; and in the man\u2019s brain the man predominates over the woman, and in the woman\u2019s brain the woman predominates over the man.\"The normal and comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony together, spiritually co-operating. If one is a man, still the woman part of his brain must have effect; and a woman also must have intercourse with the man in her...\"It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilized and uses all its faculties. Perhaps a mind that is purely masculine cannot create, any more than a mind that is purely feminine, I thought.\"Shakespeare's SisterFrom this starting point, Woolf develops the proposition that men should write from a \"man-womanly\" point of view and women from a \"woman-manly\" point of view.She believes that Shakespeare lived up to the former description. Then she imagines the idea of Shakespeare's sister, \"Judith\", who would live up to the latter.On the other hand, she argues that women shouldn't write fiction from a polemical or political perspective:\"...it is fatal for anyone who writes to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech; for anything written with that conscious bias is doomed to death.\"Woolf argues that writing is an internalised collaboration of the sexes:\"Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can be accomplished. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness.\"What is most important is the capacity to portray both sexes credibly. Woolf is trying to achieve fiction that does justice to reality.In effect, Woolf challenges her female audience to write like Shakespeare's sister:\"For my belief is that if we live another century or so [ed: 2028]...and have five hundred a year each of us and rooms of our own; if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think; if we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation to reality; and the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves...if we face the fact, for it is a fact, that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of men and women, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare\u2019s sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down.\"SOUNDTRACK:Joan Baez - \"Mary Hamilton\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHd1m....", "Woman's Day ReadVirginia Woolf, in a series of lectures she delivered at Newnham College and Girton College, two women's colleges at Cambridge University in October 1928, talked about \"Women and Fiction\" - which were subsequently collected and expanded into this book.

Of course, Virginia being Virginia, any straightforward lecture from her was impossible to expect. So discussions about women and fiction became a talk about \"A Room of One's Own\" - that too, a room reached by wandering aimlessly through the impressionistic by-lanes of the author's stream of consciousness. I should never be able to fulfil what is, I understand, the first duty of a lecturer to hand you after an hour\u2019s discourse a nugget of pure truth to wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the mantelpiece for ever. All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor point\u2014a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unsolved. Again, Virginia being Virginia, she not only pulls of the feat but makes it as fascinating any work of fiction penned by her. Because what else is fiction other than beautifully delivered lies, but lies which hold some fundamental truth within?Lies will flow from my lips, but there may perhaps be some truth mixed up with them; it is for you to seek out this truth and to decide whether any part of it is worth keeping. First of all, she creates a fictional alter-ego for her (\"Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or any other name you please\"). It is this Mary who narrates most of the lecture. The seed of the lecture is planted in her brain when she is not allowed to walk on the turf at Oxford by a Beadle - it is the prerogative of the Fellows and Scholars only; her shame and anger are further compounded by another incident when she is turned away from the library, where women are not permitted unless accompanied by a Fellow of the College or has a letter of introduction. And the anger keeps on growing, as her researches among the literati keep on harping on the theme of woman's inferiority as compared to man - all decided by male authors, of course! And she has one more perceptive insight: while instilling anger in her, the patriarchal male who controls all of society disparages females because he is angry himself - maybe because he doubted his own capability:Possibly when the professor insisted a little too emphatically upon the inferiority of women, he was concerned not with their inferiority, but with his own superiority. To establish his superiority, the male necessarily has to trample the female down.Without self-confidence we are as babes in the cradle. And how can we generate this imponderable quality, which is yet so invaluable, most quickly? By thinking that other people are inferior to one self. Women have served the purpose of providing the mirror, the distorting mirror that showed men as the larger-than-life heroes they deluded themselves to be: so keeping them in a subservient position, and limiting their lives to one of endless domesticity and drudgery, was essential from the male point of view.Our fictitious Mary Beton does some historical research on women authors from the sixteenth century onwards, and finds only a handful: basically ladies of aristocratic lineage, married to supportive husbands, and with no children. Even then, their literary output is viewed with disdain by men, resulting in many of these ladies writing solely in anger about their chains. It is not much different when we come to the nineteenth century either - the same anger is visible in Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot, who were forced to adopt male pseudonyms to sell their work. Hardly surprising - because a woman's life was not her own at all.\u2018Wife-beating\u2019, I read, \u2018was a recognized right of man, and was practised without shame by high as well as low. . . Similarly,\u2019 the historian goes on, \u2018the daughter who refused to marry the gentleman of her parents\u2019 choice was liable to be locked up, beaten and flung about the room, without any shock being inflicted on public opinion. Marriage was not an affair of personal affection, but of family avarice, particularly in the \u201cchivalrous\u201d upper classes. . . Betrothal often took place while one or both of the parties was in the cradle, and marriage when they were scarcely out of the nurses\u2019 charge.\u2019 That was about 1470, soon after Chaucer\u2019s time. This subjugated and terrorised being was totally different from the women portrayed by men in literature, however.A very queer, composite being thus emerges. Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words, some of the most profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read, could scarcely spell, and was the property of her husband. It is here, that the relevance of a room of one's own (read: economic independence) becomes important. For our Mary Beton has the fortune to have it.My aunt, Mary Beton, I must tell you, died by a fall from her horse when she was riding out to take the air in Bombay. The news of my legacy reached me one night about the same time that the act was passed that gave votes to women. A solicitor\u2019s letter fell into the post-box and when I opened it I found that she had left me five hundred pounds a year for ever. Of the two\u2014the vote and the money\u2014the money, I own, seemed infinitely the more important... ...No force in the world can take from me my five hundred pounds. Food, house and clothing are mine forever. Therefore not merely do effort and labour cease, but also hatred and bitterness. I need not hate any man; he cannot hurt me. I need not flatter any man; he has nothing to give me. So imperceptibly I found myself adopting a new attitude towards the other half of the human race. Having found a 'room of one's own', a woman can really come into her own. Her writing will be different from that of the male, because her sensitivities will be different. Where the male writes about war and football, she will write about feelings and murmurs within the drawing-room - considered no less important or trivial, however.One goes into the room\u2014but the resources of the English language would be much put to the stretch, and whole flights of words would need to wing their way illegitimately into existence before a woman could say what happens when she goes into a room. The rooms differ so completely; they are calm or thunderous; open on to the sea, or, on the contrary, give on to a prison yard; are hung with washing; or alive with opals and silks; are hard as horsehair or soft as feathers\u2014one has only to go into any room in any street for the whole of that extremely complex force of femininity to fly in one\u2019s face. How should it be otherwise? For women have sat indoors all these millions of years, so that by this time the very walls are permeated by their creative force, which has, indeed, so overcharged the capacity of bricks and mortar that it must needs harness itself to pens and brushes and business and politics. But this creative power differs greatly from the creative power of men. And one must conclude that it would be a thousand pities if it were hindered or wasted, for it was won by centuries of the most drastic discipline, and there is nothing to take its place. The literary woman, though different from the literary man, should not make any conscious effort to write based on her gender, however - because according to Virginia, being aware of one's sex in literature would kill all creativity. Each good writer, whether male or female, has both masculine and feminine sides. Their output is a composite of the makeup of their psyche. In closing, Woolf recalls a metaphor she used at the beginning - that of a fictitious sister of Shakespeare who came to London with as many dreams as he had, and perhaps even more talent than he had, but came to grief and an unmarked grave in a society essentially hostile to the woman intellectual.I told you in the course of this paper that Shakespeare had a sister; but do not look for her in Sir Sidney Lee\u2019s life of the poet. She died young\u2014alas, she never wrote a word. She lies buried where the omnibuses now stop, opposite the Elephant and Castle. Now my belief is that this poet who never wrote a word and was buried at the cross-roads still lives. She lives in you and in me, and in many other women who are not here to-night, for they are washing up the dishes and putting the children to bed. But she lives; for great poets do not die; they are continuing presences; they need only the opportunity to walk among us in the flesh. This opportunity, as I think, it is now coming within your power to give her. For my belief is that if we live another century or so\u2014I am talking of the common life which is the real life and not of the little separate lives which we live as individuals\u2014and have five hundred a year each of us and rooms of our own; if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think; if we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation to reality; and the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves; if we look past Milton\u2019s bogey, for no human being should shut out the view; if we face the fact, for it is a fact, that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of men and women, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare\u2019s sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down. Drawing her life from the lives of the unknown who were her forerunners, as her brother did before her, she will be born. As for her coming without that preparation, without that effort on our part, without that determination that when she is born again she shall find it possible to live and write her poetry, that we cannot expect, for that would he impossible. But I maintain that she would come if we worked for her, and that so to work, even in poverty and obscurity, is worth while.***This is an intensely feminist piece - yet intensely feminine, too: Virginia Woolf makes her point, and in the process, writes a beautiful essay which is a work of art in its own right..", "Brilliant.

Kafka doesn\u2019t play and he doesn\u2019t take prisoners. His \"in your grill\" message of the cruel, incomprehensibility of life and the powerlessness of the individual is unequivocal, harsh and applied with the callous dispassion of a sadist. Life sucks and then you die, alone, confused and without ever having the slightest conception of the great big WHY. Fun huh?Finishing The Trial I was left bewildered and emotionally distant, like my feelings were stuck looking out into the middle distance not really able to focus or provide me with any input. I felt numb and a bit soul-weary and I can\u2019t say I enjoyed the feeling. That said, should you read this? Absolutely and without question. Kafka\u2019s insight and ability to plumb the depths of the mysteries of existence, dark and gloomy as his answers (or lack thereof) may be, is something to behold. His work\u2026is\u2026brilliant. Reading it made me feel at times awed and at other times incredibly stupid. Awed occurred when I would catch a glimpse of the deeper meaning that he was trying to convey through his prose. In those moments I would try desperately to create a sturdy mental foothold from which to explore Kafka\u2019s next idea. Unfortunately\u2026Stupid, which happened more often, would occur when that next Kafkaesque lesson would bounce off my thick head, making me lose my tenuous foothold and go sliding back down Mount Ignorance. It was a difficult summit to reach and I was I'll-equipped. Still, the moments of clarity and flashes of insight were more than enough to make this an experience I intend to repeat until I get it right\u2026or at least die trying. THE STORY:\u201cSomeone must have traduced Joseph K., for without having done anything truly wrong, he was arrested one fine morning.\u201d Like Gregor Samsa in The Metamorphosis, we are introduced to Kafka\u2019s protagonist after the damage has been done. We are not observing a downfall, it has occurred. We are witnesses to the aftermath, the clean up. Joseph K, an officer of a prestigious bank discovers he has been accused of a crime the nature of which he is never told. We follow him from situation to situation as his desire to learn the nature of his offense leads only to more confusion and greater strife. He is meant to remain in ignorance. \u201cI see, these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.\u201d THOUGHTS: So many themes are present here that it is hard to keep it all straight in my head. On the surface, we have a skillful attack on totalitarianism and the evil of a mindless bureaucracy fueled by momentum and accountable to no one as it grinds up the individual as grease for its continued motion. This alone is frightening enough and Kafka\u2019s images of oppressive inertia unquestioned routine are tiny snapshots or hell itself. However, there seemed to be so much more that Kafka was saying, so many more levels on which his dark secular benediction could be understood. The System as life itself and the bureaucracy as fate and man\u2019s useless struggle against the forces arrayed against him by the universe. Kafka also delivers a blistering rebuke of religion in the form of a parable in the Cathedral. I\u2019m still trying to get me tiny brain entirely wrapped around this one, but the sense of sadness and crushing hopelessness of the story was still a gut punch. \u2018Everyone strives to attain the Law,' answers the man, 'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is nearing his end and his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: 'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended for you. I am now going to shut it.\u2019 And later in this same conversation, \u201cit is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary.\u201dStill, as somber and dreary as the story is there are moments that are so brilliantly written that I actually found myself smiling despite the overall tone of the story. The Painter\u2019s lecture to K about the difference strategies and processes involved in seeking among \u201cactual acquittal,\u201d \u201capparent acquittal\u201d and \u201cprotraction\u201d was nothing short of genius. In fact, given that the novel is only 200+ pages, I think those 15-20 pages are worth reading the entire novel. Overall, I am very satisfied to have finally read this as a personal exercise rather than a school-enforced trauma. I got a lot out of this. There were chunks of the book that I found slow and plodding, probably because I was stuck at the base of Mount Ignorance and didn\u2019t absorb the ideas Kafka was dishing. Still, it did make for some dry reading time as Kafka\u2019s writing is not ear-pleasing enough that you can simply enjoy the prose. His prose is good, but it is more a functional delivery system for his mind-rupturing ideas than for the beauty of the words themselves. Thus, for the moment, and given my imperfect understanding of all that Kafka had to say in this brilliant novel, I am going to say 4 stars. 4 stars full of staggering intellect and multi-layered, nuanced insight into \u201cwhat it\u2019s all about\u201d delivered with the skill of a surgeon. I\u2019ll be in the recovery room for a while.

Is life the love of a cold, cruel former lover bating us on while only concerned with themselves? What use is logic in an illogical prison where the opinion of the masses reigns supreme? Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial is the world we all live in, unlocked through layers of allegory to expose the beast hidden from plain sight. On the surface it is an exquisite examination of bureaucracy and bourgeoisie with a Law system so complex and far-reaching that even key members are unable to unravel it\u2019s complicated clockwork. However, this story of a trial\u2014one that never occurs other than an arrest and a solitary conference that goes nowhere\u2014over an unmentioned crime serves as a brutal allegory for our existence within a judgemental societal paradigm under the watch of a God who dishes out hellfire to the guilty. This is a world where man\u2019s noose is only a doorway. The Trial is not for the faint of heart or fragile psyche yet, while the bleakness is laid on thick, it is also permeated with a marvelous sense of humor and a fluid prose that keeps the pages flipping and the reading hours pushing forward towards dawn. This is a dark comedy of the human comedy, full of the freeing chortles of gallow humor. Kafka\u2019s nightmarish vision is the heartbeat of our own existence, chronicling the frustrations of futility when applying logic to the reality of the absurd, yet factual, nature of life.Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done anything wrong, he was arrested.This memorable opening line is the perfect establishing shot for Kafka\u2019s, and Joseph K.\u2019s, world. One can be sure of their innocence, yet fall to the blade all the same. The most startling and accurate portrayal of mankind is found when K. goes to visit the painter in the slums and finds...a disgusting, steaming yellow fluid poured forth, before which a rat fled into the nearby sewer. At the bottom of the steps a small child was lying face down on the ground, crying, but it could hardly be heard above the noise coming from a sheet metal shop\u2026We, humanity, are prostrate and bawling in a toxic wasteland, unloved and ignored by the absent parents. Not even passersby stop to help the child, or are even away, for the noise of industry drowns it out. This is a world where corporations are \u2018people\u2019 and actual lives are thrown to the gutter for \u2018the good of the company\u2019, where soulless abstract money-making concepts are given a higher priority than our own shared flesh-and-blood. The worst part is that we accept this. We tow the party line, we uphold something meaningless and only given power by our collective acceptance. \u2018You may object that it is not a trial at all,\u2019 says K. to the courtroom, \u2018you are quite right, for it is only a trial if I recognize it as such.\u2019 These are not political opinions I am presenting, just the fact that much of our society, economy and political structure exists only because we recognize it as so and prescribe meaning to something inherently meaningless. Children, such as the child crying in a pool of yellow filth, are a key motif in the novel. Their parents are never apparent and they run like wild animals. The gaggle of young girls outside the painters apartment perfectly reflect the wild masses of ignorance, defying respect for privacy and barging into places they aren\u2019t wanted, needed or even should be simply because they can. One girl is described as hunchbacked and not yet an adult, yet full of sexuality which she asserts over K. \u2018Neither her youth nor her deformity had prevented her early corruption.\u2019 These girls, we are told, also belong to the court, another place where the persona is depicted more like beast than man, preying on those around them with their lusts. Take, for example, the student in the attic courtroom who asserts his dominance over the married women through his power. He, too, is slightly deformed with bow-legs that call to mind classic depictions of Satan with his animalistic torso and hoofed feet, and bushy red beard like something from nature and not urban society. He also snaps at K.\u2019s hand with his teeth in defense, like a dog(Like a dog\u2019 is the final line of dialogue in the novel, concerning a violent and abrupt execution. Seemingly we are nothing above the beasts of the world.), which isn\u2019t how one would expect an educated man of the Law to respond. Even all the textbooks are actually just pornography, the court filled with carnal desires instead of logic and learned reasoning. This is the force of nature K, and all of us, fight against when attempting to address our condition with logic. We are nothing but dogs pit into a dogfight of which we had no free will in being placed. K. is a free-thinker drown by the obdurate glare of the masses, condemned for something unknown and never given an opportunity to prove innocence. They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.How like our world today where we accept opinions without wondering the qualifications; internet slander or a simple viral meme can destroy a life or an idea simply because it is funny even if it isn\u2019t rooted in reality. K. is all of us, K. is the everyman, K. is us faced with the world around us. A world where trying to go up against it will only lead to frustration and futility. Through all his proceedings, all his legal advice, nothing is learned. Lawyers and confidants only seem to discuss the workings of the trial and court system; the more we learn, the less we understand. The system is so complicated that it stalemates itself, and it seems almost pointless to investigate. Is there purpose in assessing our lives, our condition in the world? Not if we address it with logic. This is futility. But, perhaps, if we assess it on it\u2019s own terms, then even if our fate is still sealed we can glean a bit of insight.That is why this story is presented as an allegory. The Trial is not a story about the Law or bureaucracy despite the outward appearance. This is society as a whole and pushes towards a religious allegory that is difficult to swallow. K. is told that even if he is acquitted, he may return home to be arrested again. Our reputation is unshakable and even when you prove your innocence over slander, people will still hold it against you. The word \u2018allegedly\u2019 is wonderfully damning in this way. K. hears that there is legend of lawyers getting clients fully acquitted, but no proof of this exists. Nobody even knows who these lawyers are. There is also higher courts, higher judges that nobody knows the name of that also seem to exist only in legend. These unseen, unknowable eyes of justice are like the eyes of God. One may be acquitted amongst their peers, but their soul goes to a higher court that will rule the final verdict. \u2018Can\u2019t you see two steps in front of you,\u2019 the Priest shrieks at K., chastising him for his inability to look beyond his assumptions of the world and his logic. He proceeds with a parable that summarizes K.\u2019s, and everyone\u2019s, fate in the world in which a man is denied entrance into the halls of the Law. He waits his whole life, pestering the gatekeeper. Moments before his death of old age, the gatekeeper reveals that the entrance was meant solely for him, then closes the gates. The perfect expression of futility. K. protests that the man was deceived, yet the Priest argues that deception is not in the story. What we have is the absurd, K. wishing to assess his trial through due-process and logical reasoning, but failing to see that such verdicts are beyond that. I always snatched at the world with twenty hands, and not for a very laudable motive, either. That was wrong, and am I to show now that not even a year\u2019s trial has taught me anything? His fate was already decided, and his efforts are in vain. It should come as no surprise, then, that K. is so suffocated in the stifling air of the court houses. Who wouldn\u2019t feel faint and overcome with illness when beleaguered by the absurd where no assertion of innocence matters?The court wants nothing from you. It receives you when you came and it dismisses you when you go.The painter shows K. a portrait of a judge, depicted above his own post (the portrait a gift to a woman\u2014yet another example of the abuse of power for carnal desire), but the most striking image is that of Justice. Justice is painted with winged feet, in motion at the request of the court, to also represent Victory. Yet the real horror is revealed when K. discovers the blending creates an image more akin to the God of The Hunt. We have a court system, a religious system, a moral system, that is more concerned with victory than actual justice, and seeks out prey for sport. We are all victims to this system, a system that is self-sustaining, \u2018too big to fail\u2019, and incorporates everyone. Nobody is safe from the system, and nobody is not a part of it. K. is the sacrificial victim of all of us, his death and futility a parable of our own endeavors in this, and the next, life. Kafka\u2019s The Trial is just as important today as when it was written. It is a book that will leave you gasping for air, and thankful for it.5/5\u2018One must lie low, no matter how much it went against the grain, and try to understand that this great organization remained, so to speak, in a state of delicate balance, and that if someone took it upon himself to alter the dispositions of things around him, he ran the risk of losing his footing and falling to destruction, while the organization would simply right itself by some compensating reaction in another part of its machinery \u2013 since everything interlocked \u2013 and remain unchanged, unless, indeed, which was very probable, it became still more rigid, more vigilant, severer, and more ruthless.\u2019.", "Has this ever happened to you?

But, you see, those three words strung together convey the sense of otherworldliness, some diabolical satire that's made a nightmare of a reality that's usually pretty good about behaving itself. The problem with that is the fact that this story adheres more closely to reality than most books dare to dream of doing. There's no phantasmagorical twisting of the entire face of reality. This is reality. And it needs no aid in inspiring the most abject of terror.Arrests of innocents. Hazy procedures. Courts obscured by other courts. Files disappearing into the dark. \"I see,\" said K., nodding, \"these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.\" \"That must be it,\" said the woman, who had not quite understood him.Judgment determined by accusation rather than by trial.\"We are only being punished because you accused us; if you hadn't, nothing would have happened, not even if they had discovered what we did.

The reason for his conviction is never revealed and even the officers who came to deliver the news are uniformed.In the next chapters, we follow K. in a series of encounters that are ground for meaningless and empty discussions with various characters that seldom reappear throughout the story and don\u2019t seem to have an efficient role in the progress of the narrative. K\u2019s so-called quest to seek answers and vindicate his name turn out to be futile as he never musters enough courage or audacity to extract definite answers and instead, allows his complacency to let him act in a way that harms him more than it helps him in his case. (I especially loved how almost every female character seem to want him, which feeds his arrogance all the more) For a year, Josef K awaits a trial that never happens; he\u2019s never told the reason behind his criminal charge and the ultimate zenith of befuddlement comes with K\u2019s death that is also underdone in mystifying circumstances. Nothing is explained or elucidated and yet people seem to abundantly laud Kafka for an unfinished, miserable excuse for a novel which the author himself wanted to be burned posthumously. It really saddens me \u2018cause after hearing copious praise for Kafka, the anticipation upon starting this novel was great and I was eager to be acquainted with his \u201cgenius\u201d, but my high expectations were annihilated by an immense disappointment.The Trial is among the most disturbing books I\u2019ve laid eyes on to this day. It was an excruciating experience from which my brain cells are still suffering aftershocks. The atmosphere of the novel was so odd and gruesome; the rooms with low ceilings and stuffy, fetid offices made me feel like I\u2019m having a bizarre nightmare. (Well, at least it\u2019s better than his other unfinished book about a man metamorphosed into an insect). Kafka intentionally delineated an inhuman world inflicted with the depravity of the law (which is ironic because Kafka was a lawyer himself). And when you finally finish this story of 200ish pages (but you feel like it\u2019s 2000, I don\u2019t know how Kafka managed to do that), you\u2019re supposed to be in a state of awe \u2018cause it\u2019s so fucking deep and philosophical, aiming to depict life and the big fat interrogation point behind our existence and its purpose. Well. That was a waste of time. Max Brod should\u2019ve listened to Kafka and set fire to his manuscripts. There, I said it. .", "Guilt and innocence: Who can be considered innocent and who can be considered guilty?After all, K. lived in a state governed by law, there was universal peace, all statutes were in force; who dared assault him in his own lodgings?The state is an ogre\u2026 The citizen is a pygmy\u2026 And an ogre can do with a pygmy whatever it wishes\u2026 But ogres prefer to eat pygmies and for appearance\u2019s sake they use law\u2026 And to apply law there are courts and bureaucracy.The gradations and ranks of the court are infiniteGuilt and innocence: Who can be considered innocent and who can be considered guilty?After all, K. lived in a state governed by law, there was universal peace, all statutes were in force; who dared assault him in his own lodgings?The state is an ogre\u2026 The citizen is a pygmy\u2026 And an ogre can do with a pygmy whatever it wishes\u2026 But ogres prefer to eat pygmies and for appearance\u2019s sake they use law\u2026 And to apply law there are courts and bureaucracy.The gradations and ranks of the court are infinite, extending beyond the ken even of initiates. The proceedings in the courts of law are generally a mystery to the lower officials as well; therefore they can almost never follow the progress of the cases they are working on throughout their course; the case enters their field of vision, often they know not whence, and continues on, they know not where.Once the machinery of soulless bureaucracy started working, there is no way to stop it.An apparent acquittal is handled differently. There is no further change in the files except for adding to them the certification of innocence, the acquittal, and the grounds for the acquittal. Otherwise they remain in circulation; following the law court\u2019s normal routine they are passed on to the higher courts, come back to the lower ones, swinging back and forth with larger or smaller oscillations, longer or shorter interruptions. These paths are unpredictable. Externally it may sometimes appear that everything has been long since forgotten, the file has been lost, and the acquittal is absolute. No initiate would ever believe that. No file is ever lost, and the court never forgets.To the state, there is no such thing as an innocent person. If an individual doesn\u2019t obey the state, the state exterminates an individual as a vermin..", "This book haunts me.

Is K actually guilty or is he innocent? Is this novel a nightmare sequence or a paranormal encountering? Why are so many characters never heard from again? And who is that mysterious figure at the end of the novel that witnesses K's fate? There are just so many questions, but no damned answers!This is frustrating, so frustrating. The novel leaves the reader with an overwhelming sense of perplexity. There is no definitive explanation as to what has actually happened; there is no logical sense of the events. But, then K doesn\u2019t know either; he is just as confused by the strange happenings as the reader. The events are completely unexplainable and unfathomable; thus, Kafka\u2019s trial will stay with the me for the rest of my life, as I ponder this bizarre novel again, and again.  There are no answers!K wakes up on the morning of his thirtieth birthday; he goes outside his room and finds several men eating his breakfast. He is informed he is under arrest; the men don\u2019t tell him why; they leave and he is able to go about his daily life although he must attend court next week. They give him a location, but no time. He arrives; he is accused for something they don\u2019t inform him of. He storms out of the room and is hounded by the situation ever since. He attempts to prove his innocence, but what he is innocent of he doesn\u2019t know. A year later, on his thirtieth birthday,(view spoiler)[ two men arrive and sentence him; he is taken to a quarry and murdered. (hide spoiler)] The reader has very little idea why it has happened. \"Someone must have been spreading slander about K., for one morning he was arrested, though he had done nothing wrong.\"Indeed, the Trial uses fragmentation in its plot to further establish the ungraspable nature of K\u2019s encounters, such as in chapter three when he attempts to save a washerwoman from an evil and lustful student. He chases the couple at the stair is where he encounters a fog and is forced to retreat. The event is never mentioned again. The situation is nightmarish, and like a dream, is forgotten about quickly. This tells us that no meaning will be had from the Trial; it tells us that there will never be any answers.  What exactly is this wierd court?The court that conducts the trial is shrouded in even more mystery. Just who are these people that can psychologically manipulate with so little effort? They are a powerful order, which is indicated by their sessions always accruing on the highest floor of the building; this evokes their, strange, authoritative presence. There are even suggestions that this court hold sessions in each, and every, building in the city, which again creates more weirdness. \"The faces that surrounded him! Tiny black eyes darted about, cheeks dropped like those of drunken men, the long beards were stiff and scraggly, and when they pulled on them, it seemed as if they were merely forming claws, not pulling beards. Beneath the beards, however \u2013 and this was the true discovery K. made \u2013 badges of various sizes and colors shimmered on the collars of their jackets  Is this a dream?However, one thing that remains clear through the novel is the characterisation of K. He is completely bland; he has no endearing qualities whatsoever, yet the women seem to throw themselves at him on multiple occasions. This resonates in the dream world, because only in a dream world could a man like K be such a womaniser. He is meek, powerless and accepting of his unjust fate, so only a dream could a shadow of a man like K be so attractive an irresistible. \"I recruit women helpers, he thought, almost amazed: first Fra\u00fclein B\u00fcrstner, then the court usher's wife, and now this little nurse, who seems to have an inexplicable desire for me.\"In spite of his blandness and alienation, he is the only rational character within the novel. I like to think a little bit of Kafka comes through here. I\u2019ve been reading up on his personal history, and he was a very segregated man; he was disbeliever amongst the Jewish religion; he was distant to his overbearing farther and the opposite sex. He didn\u2019t seem to fit in, perhaps a little bit of Kafka comes through in K. Perhaps he wanted to show what it would be like cut off from the rest of civilization. Overall, this is an iconic piece of literature; it is one that every serious reader should read before they die because it is completely unique. Its strange narrative resembles a dream; its events are pointless and impenetrable like a nightmare that stays with you forever. Indeed, this book will never be forgotten by those that have read it, as the unanswered questions will haunt for the rest of their days. I\u2019ve quite literally been unable to sleep when thinking about this book, as the question \u201cwhat exactly does it mean?\u201d lingers in my mind.

That\u2019s understandable. And I think you should also know that should you plainly persist in it, you\u2019ll probably be Put on Trial. Figuratively speaking.Welcome to the Absurd.But there\u2019s also an UP side to that. I think that anyone who has lived a highly idiosyncratic life, like Franz Kafka and my own totally colossally unsuperstar self, has in time developed a larger ideological container for their intellectual life.Sorta like quantum mechanics does, for we have come to see the laws and customs of the world under that selfsame Aegis of Absurdity.And that is the sense in which we appreciate the Rule of Law in this world. The law is itself idiosyncratic and accretive, but it WORKS. Under quantum mechanics, if something works MOST of the time, we can allow that as a constant FOR US. Even if should we ourselves should be put in the dock.But, allowing it to be a constant, can we learn to Love it, as being in itself in a state of Absolute momentary transcendence over an Absurd physical universe? Even if that transcendence means our death? For that\u2019s the vision Kafka seems to have attained as his life drew to a close...That\u2019s - or so I believe - Kafka\u2019s premise in this novel. If a thing works most of the time, that\u2019s normal - and good in a practical sense. And that\u2019s a start. Even though we\u2019re implicated in the machinery of Law, the Law\u2019s Good.And we ALL have to take the Fire as punishment - now - or later. Don\u2019t laugh. I\u2019m serious.I could be wrong, but this seems to be the one novel the great hag-ridden Franz Kafka completed. I believe that that\u2019s for a good reason. OK. Many of you may not know this, but at one point in his later Diary, Kafka wrote the words (as best as I can remember and can now paraphrase):\u2018If you disagree with the rules of the world, the world is invariably Right.\u2019He wrote those words to mark a critical split in his personal path that, as I believe, he had finally and irrevocably decided to take. It would give him Closure. And pain.Except now, in the Pain - was Hope.And it\u2019s not just that the law is just a rule to follow, not that it\u2019s wrong-headed but nevertheless our duty, not that it\u2019s dumb but the best people can manage - no. The law of the world is right. That\u2019s the Real Way of the World. And the universe, in fact.It\u2019s just, you may say, that we are in a world that\u2019s Absurd. But actually, then we\u2019re of no importance, suddenly. Remember that feeling?That\u2019s called waking up.Anyone for Hegel? For this is just Hegel rehashed. But a Hegel Redux for postmodernists!But it\u2019s surely more than that... on a personal level. Because it\u2019s the result of a long personal struggle with Angst.We know the Law\u2019s something Kafka\u2019s imperious Dad really believed in, and something he felt it was young Franzl\u2019s duty to believe, too. So Kafka senior pounded it into his son\u2019s soul.You see that in spades in that famous story in which his Dad tells him to jump off the long end of a short pier. And he does.Why, in the name of all that\u2019s right and proper? That\u2019s just the way it is. My way or the highway, kid!And so Franz wrote, and wrote, and WROTE - to let the steam out. As you and I do too.Finally, here, he couldn\u2019t argue with his superego anymore. He was finally gonna take the straight and narrow path. Cause it was so right, it was absurd.And that\u2019s what K learned when he came of age. We are NOTHING to the universe. Did he go ballistic as a result? You bet! That\u2019s the Meaning of the Absurd, which all of us must face. Every day of our lives!For the Trial IS our daily workaday grind. You can\u2019t Pooh-Pooh your coming of age again.We are accused; we are belittled; we are slandered behind our back. And we go on. We NEED our job. We get enraged. But we go on...It\u2019s built into our lives. It\u2019s a total disconnect - like COVID-19, it\u2019s a great Grand Canyon that makes a huge gap in our minds between subjectivity and objectivity. When we\u2019re at home, we try to relax. We let loose on the phone; we harangue our tormentors in our dreams; we get even. But that\u2019s not what Kafka meant.We HATE the conditions that are laid out for our life. Auden memorably says our pet dogs often \u201cwish their Tall Conditions (us) Dead\u201d - just as we often see daggers in our minds when we see our absurdly condition-imposing leaders.But law is law. Can we learn, maybe, to follow it in spite of itself? For we\u2019re really just:Men and bits of paper.Not one law at the office, and one law at home and on vacation. No. For Kafka now, The Soul is Answerable to the law of God. THAT was his Dad\u2019s message. And this little realization was K\u2019s first reluctant step towards Faith. One small step...And his ultimate faith in the Law as Love.A faith he finally starts to absorb in his last work, America.Yes, the Self - in time and space - answers to the Law.It hurts! We kick and scream in pure anguish!Agenbite of Inwit.But like him, we DO as we are told. What option do we have?But the Way that opens up to us in our books is really the same long and winding path that leads to the final reconciliation of Law and Love in the total transcendence of our pain.Which Franz chose at the end.Which I believe all started in this simple fork in the road:Where we choose the Way of Obedience. And in itself -It\u2019s a long and winding road.I\u2019ve seen that road So many times before - Don\u2019t leave me standing hereLead me to Your Door!And He will open it to you.But where it all starts, is in a place we all love to hate:In His Law.A Law that means our Death, and our Life..", "\"A mind is like a parachute.

Who are they, K wonders? They look as if they might be policemen, but neither he, nor the reader, can be certain. They could be pranksters for all he knows. Even the country he lives in isn\u2019t name-checked.So many unanswered questions:Who is he?Who are they?Why has he been arrested?Where are we?Does time have a beginning or an end?Why did the chicken cross the road?This, my fine bibliophilic friends, is an enigma burritoed in a paradox. There is something farcical about the situation he finds himself in; the ensuing cockeyed exchange of dialogue was almost Monty Pythonesque.I shall paraphrase (apologies to Mr Kafka)...\"Take me to your superior!\"\"He will see you as soon as he wants to see you.\"\"Who are you?\"\"We\u2019re free, you\u2019re not, and you\u2019re going to be put on trial.\"\"On trial, for what?\"\"Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, isn\u2019t it, eh? Beautiful plumage.\"The absurdity continues.There follows a kangaroo court and the comically surreal appearance of a whip-man, whose job it is to give people a damn good flogging. I don\u2019t know if I was meant to be outraged, but I found it really funny (there\u2019s something wrong with me, I\u2019m sure of it).Kafka uses existentialism like Banksy uses a spray can. K is trying to remain rational while the world around him has become irrational - something most of us have experienced at some stage in our lives.As is also the case with Orwell\u2019s 1984, this book hints at the totalitarian regimes that were likely to follow.I don\u2019t profess to understand much of what Kafka hoped to symbolise in this allegorical mystery (I suspect he didn\u2019t want anyone to unlock all of its secrets anyway), and one gets the feeling that he deliberately leads us into a literary cul-de-sac of his own choosing.The blurb describes the book as being \u2018terrifying\u2019 and \u2018chilling\u2019. I found it to be neither.If anything, I found it rather droll.Let me explain myself thus\u2026I have a lugubrious friend. His name is Mark. Mark is so overly pessimistic and melancholic, that he creases me up with laughter. Then, when he asks me what it is that\u2019s so funny (with that glum look on his face), I crack up even more! He\u2019s a hoot, and so is this book!I thoroughly enjoyed being trapped in Franz Kafka\u2019s web and I must revisit Metamorphosis, his crowning achievement.I read it years ago, when I was too young to properly \u2018get\u2019 it. Not that I\u2019m likely to totally understand it even now! : ).", "The tortured bureaucratic world described in The Trial always strikes me as startlingly modern.

I wonderedHow The Trial might have started if Kafka had been an academic writing in 2010K's latest conference paper had been rejected, and now he sat in front of his laptop and read through the referees' comments. One of them, evidently not a native speaker of English, had sent a page of well-meaning advice, though K was unsure whether he understood his recommendations. The second referee had only written three lines, in a dismissive tone that hurt K's feelings. K had an appointment with his thesis advisor later that day, and wondered whether it would appear more constructive to rewrite the paper for submission to another conference, or to say that he was drawing a line so that he could concentrate on his dissertation. He was trying to decide between these two courses of action, neither of which greatly appealed to him, when his officemate arrived. Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller, a pale, slightly-built, earnest girl with wispy brown hair, was writing an extremely dull dissertation on the discourse semantics of phone sex; K had never dared ask her why she had chosen this topic, which seemed singularly ill-adapted to her general demeanour. Today, she was also in a bad mood. She sat down and opened her own laptop without saying a word, and typed industriously. After about twenty minutes, she looked up and sighed. \"Problems?\" asked K.Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller sighed again. Then, in an uninflected monotone, she read a crude and unimaginatively pornographic passage, to which K listened attentively. He was, as usual, embarrassed to discover that he had become sexually aroused; but Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller never once allowed her eyes to stray from her screen, and K was fairly sure that his momentary excitement had passed unnoticed. She concluded, and opened a spreadsheet.\"Do you believe that she is actually touching herself here, or that she is merely saying that she would do so in her fantasy?\" she asked tiredly.K considered the matter. \"I think it's only in the fantasy,\" he said after a while. \"But I'm not sure. Maybe 60%.\"Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller filled in two boxes in her spreadsheet.\"Now, suppose that she had said `will' instead of `must' in the last sentence. Would your judgement still be the same?\"K asked her to read the sentence again. \"I would say that made it more likely,\" he said, after further careful thought. \"80%. I'm definitely not certain.\"Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller filled in two more boxes, and examined the new figures that appeared at the bottom of the sheet. \"Not statistically significant,\" she said in a dejected tone. \"I know I shouldn't keep checking all the time, but I can't help it. I need more data.\"K had several times been on the point of asking Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller where her examples came from, but was afraid that this might appear intrusive; he knew almost nothing about her private life. He suddenly realised that he was meant to be seeing his advisor in a quarter of an hour. Apologising awkwardly, he put on his coat and left. The walk across the campus was, however, shorter than he had remembered, and he arrived in good time. Professor Holz appeared surprised to see him, and K reminded him that they had agreed to meet.K's advisor was thickset and completely bald, despite only being in his mid-forties. He had a second position at another university, and was rarely to be found in his office; normally K would have been glad to have cornered him and be able to ask for advice, but today he could not think of anything to say. He waited for Professor Holz to take the initiative. K's advisor seemed equally at a loss. He took off his rimless glasses, and polished them carefully before speaking.\"So, K,\" he began, typing as he did so. \"I understand your paper was rejected.\"K confirmed that this was indeed true.\"Well,\" continued Professor Holz, \"I think we both agree about the nature of the problem.\"K was in fact unsure what the professor was referring to; he knew though that he had reservations about the research direction K had chosen, and assumed that this was a veiled allusion to the objections he had raised at their last meeting. He cleared his throat in a way that could be interpreted as assent.\"I understand, however,\" said Holz, \"that your collaboration with Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller has been more successful.\"K looked at his advisor carefully, trying to guess whether he was being ironic, but was unable to tell. He agreed hesitantly, trying to sound as noncommital as he could in case it was a trap. But the professor suddenly looked at his watch and rose, exclaiming that he had forgotten another meeting. He smiled apologetically to K as he escorted him from the room, and locked the door.\"I would appreciate a progress report before the end of the week,\" he said, as they stood in front of the elevator. \"You have heard, of course, that the new funding cuts oblige us to reexamine our priorities.\"This sounded vaguely familiar to K, who had however assumed that he was not one of the people affected.\"It's mainly a formality,\" said the professor. \"None the less, I would like you to take it seriously and do a thorough job. It is particularly important that you describe your short-term objectives.\"There were several questions that K urgently wished to ask, but at that moment the elevator arrived. The professor disappeared into it, saying something that K was unable to catch. He took the stairs down to street level, and walked slowly back to his office. Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller now seemed much more animated, and suggested to K that they eat lunch together at the Italian restaurant they both liked.\"I'm sorry I was like that earlier,\" she said as they finished their spaghetti. \"It's this horrible report. I'm so glad I've finally turned it in. I suppose you did yours days ago.\"K waved his hand in a gesture of vague assent, though he was now starting to feel rather concerned.\"Oh good!\" said Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller, and smiled at him in a way that, for a moment, almost made her look attractive. \"Then maybe I can ask you to give me some more linguistic judgements?

Around 4 pm, he received an email reminding him that the progress report was due by the end of the following day. He attempted to think about it while simultaneously listening to Fr\u00e4ulein M\u00fcller, but this proved to be impossible. Twice, she interrupted him with a puzzled air, and pointed out inconsistencies in his answers. K was forced to give her his full attention.

Franz Kafka (1883-1924), who was to languish for years as an employee of a commercial insurance company that made him do acts he disapproved of, mostly when they were not under morality or simple humanity, spent his free time, often solitary, to write. Still, he wanted nothing to come to light of his work, a desire that, remarkably, fortunately, his friend, the poet Max Brod, would refuse to grant.I was between fifteen and sixteen years old when I read The Trial. I have unforgettable memories of it simultaneously as a more or less accepted attraction for this writing which can frighten and disturb at the same time as it opens our eyes to the reality of relations between citizens and administrations. Connections, where the city had consistently placed in a position of subservience, are very humiliating in the face of administrative agents who regard their dialogists as anonymous pawns and draw their force on what they hold if they wish to access this kind of information. Files that can reveal what they want to know about the people who come to present their requests. However, the novel's hero, Joseph K., is precisely in this situation of powerlessness and dependence. When learning that he is dealing with justice for facts, he does not know anything. He suffers heavily from being in this situation to becoming a daily victim of an obsession. The more worried as he considers himself innocent and has nothing to be ashamed of when he sees the gazes of people indifferent to his problem turning towards him, incredulous, even suspicious. Even when one has compassion for him, and even if some are ready to help him, they cannot do anything, coming up against a wall like him. It goes as far as the absurd, and it is indeed ridiculous. Yet, this fantastic has something objective. It describes the absurdity of our lives when, in the confrontation with an administration, especially before the legal authorities, we find ourselves reduced to being just a number. - that of a file handled among thousands, even millions of others, which reduces us to no longer being than an object and no longer a subject, still less an active subject. Ultimately, we could tolerate an obedient issue. However, we still prefer a topic which is content to silently undergo what happens to him because it is the law and the \"logic (illogical and unjust but unstoppable) of things.\". Joseph K. refuses this state of affairs; he has his way of reacting, contesting, or rebelling (without making too many waves). Still, it is his concern to know which revolt is a subversive act in the eyes of authority and public opinion, as if it were futile. The one who rebels is embarrassed that he does not allow himself to stop by anything in this quest. The first step towards justification and rehabilitation attempts is to fight to forgive oneself and reestablish the truth and its honour, which ultimately is never entirely satisfied because justice is decidedly not of this world. Yes, Mr Joseph K., therefore, stop asking to have access to your file and to consult it because we do not even know where it is: how do you want us to know that we know where to look for him since we do not know exactly where he ended up arriving. Just know that you charged and that it has happened. And besides, everyone knows, what's the use of fighting, what's the use of raising mountains of files. It won't change anything.I will not describe the end of this novel as a disturbing work that forces us to ask ourselves the right questions: are we not concerned, too, each on our own?

The process of the trial playing out even if it is not outwardly 'in session' and K's own processing of events, forces us to recognize that our decisions are consequential. Even decisions that don't seem significant. This is especially apparent at the end of the novel (which brings us to a sort of tragic anticlimactic climax).

There aren't actually any characters that take any human shape. There is no conflict or resolution and the only epiphany is the one you might or might not have at the end of it. Truth be told, 'The Trial' is nothing but an allegory.An allegory of what is up to you to decide. I think I interpret it on the most universal level and see The Trial as a symbol of human existence. We don't know why we are here, how it is going to end and even what the rules of the game are. Yet, we take this frustrating journey trying to make sense of it, comforted by little meaningless bogus victories that fool us into believing some progress has been made. We long ago learnt that the 'actual acquittal' is unattainable but we refuse to give up. This is how I see it. However, many literary critics and other smart people see it differently and that is their prerogative.There is, for example, a quite interesting theory that 'The Trial' was born as an inmediate result of the break-up of Kafka's engagement to Felice Bauer. Felice Bauer was, one might say, an uncomplicated woman. She was Kafka's muse and his anchor in the reality. Kafka needed her to write and to stay sane. What Felice got out of the affair is unclear as her letters didn't survive. No doubt, it must have been frustrating as Kafka's idea of love was definitely not a healthy one. Their relationship consituted mostly of letters and occasional meetings which made Kafka the happiest just after they were over. He did finally propose to Felice but emphasized he would be a rather rubbish husband as he was simply not cut out for family life. And so it went on. If anyone felt like they were on an endless, incomprehensible trial, it was, in my opinion, Felice. But, of course, Franz maintains it was him - because finally Felice's friends and relatives decided to put an end to it, called Kafka in, forced him to knock it off and leave the poor girl alone. That meeting/interrogation was his 'trial'.Now, I don't want to entertain this theory because if it is true, I would have to reduce the rating for 'Trial' to some 2-3 stars and put it on my 'brats' shelf I have for selfish, woe-is-me individuals acting like brats. I prefer to stick to the human-existence allegory which I find quite moving in its Weltschmertz way.If you are interested in further reading on the subject, check John Banville's article about Kafka's Trial and his affair with Fraulein Bauer here:http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/...You can also find fictionalised (by Francine Prose) letter from Felice Bauer to Kafka in this collection of invented love letters : Four Letter Word: Invented Correspondence from the Edge of Modern Romance.

He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s charged with, but he\u2019s informed it\u2019s serious. He is then sucked into a cloudy, ludicrous world of pointless interactions amidst fog of peak ambiguity. In general, the proceedings were kept secret not only from the public but also from the accused. Only as far as possible, of course, but that was to a very great extent. The accused was not allowed to see the court documents either, and it as very difficult to deduce anything from the hearings about the documents on which they were based, especially for the accused, who was prejudiced and had all sorts of worries to distract himThe lawyers are evasive and dysfunctional. The judges are invisible and opaque. The court buildings are in attics at the top of dilapidated buildings for heaven\u2019s sake! Josef K., is distracted by pointless and fruitless journeys \u2013 for example, he ends up in a tiny, dark, stinking hot apartment trying to obtain information from a court artist, but it takes ages, and it\u2019s terribly difficult. For example, the door is tucked right behind the artist's bed - now this becomes a topic of conversation, a problem to be solved. Josef ends up buying some paintings, that\u2019s it \u2013 Oh Dear!!!!!There\u2019s a wonderfully disturbing scene in a chapter called The Whip-Man, involving a tall man clad in leather wielding a whip, punishing two characters we encountered earlier in the story. They\u2019re all in a tiny, cupboard-like room. Hunched over a candle. It\u2019s just like the gimp scene from Pulp Fiction.

It is this \u00dcbermensch moment that led Duchamp to graffiti an upturned urinal and display it in the Academy. It is what led to the design of the Barbican. It is what led Kafka to write The Trial. It is a horrible, horrible moment.I won\u2019t mince words; I loathe this book. It manages to be all the worst parts of self-indulgent, self-effacing, ponderous and pointless. It is a hateful book. This too was forced upon by the Texas Independent School District as part of their on-going campaign to Stop Kids Reading. Up until then I had read only decent books and it was a shock to realize any crap could be a classic as long the author was foreign and the subject was avant garde. The Trial isn\u2019t so much a story as a needlessly complicated suicide note.A man is informed he is on trial, but not for what. Throughout the chapters he is gradually (and by his own stupid volition) separated from his friends and family. Each chapter he meets a set of unsettling people and they talk mildly depressing gibberish before disappearing from the story forever. At the end, the main character ends up in some sort of newly surreal, inexplicable and unexplained hall of light where he dies in a similar fashion. I\u2019d call that a spoiler but there was never really another way for this book to go. There is no trial. That, more than anything really pissed me off.Nothing occurs in this book. It\u2019s just a collage of conversations Franz has had with the nihilistic voices in his head. They should have been put down in a diary and read by a reputable psychoanalyst, not published in 37 languages and crammed down the maw of 16 year olds. God is dead. Choice is an illusion. Reason and logic are comforting lies we tell ourselves and death is the only certainty. This is nothing we hadn\u2019t heard before from My Chemical Romance so why our teachers thought we needed additional reasons to cut ourselves and go overboard on eye-makeup I\u2019ll never know.

He wakes up one day with strange men in his apartment telling him he's under arrest. Why or for what offense, no one knows. The arresting officers themselves don't know and can't tell him.

But he is understandably anxioLook at Joseph K., a bank officer living in a country with a constitution. He wakes up one day with strange men in his apartment telling him he's under arrest. Why or for what offense, no one knows. The arresting officers themselves don't know and can't tell him. Even if he's under arrest, however, no one picks him up or locks him in jail. He can still go to his office, work, perform his customary daily chores, and do whatever he wants to do as he awaits his trial. But he is understandably anxious and worried. He is, after all, charged with an unknown but very grave offense. He has a criminal case. He is an accused. He is under arrest.For this problem he consults so many. He gets a lawyer. His uncle comes to his aid. He talks with his lawyer's other client--also charged and under arrest like him. He consults other people, a painter (who is said to know the \"Court\"), some women, a priest, etc. about his case. But no one can tell him what the charge is and what his sentence will be. The \"Examining Magistrate,\" the \"Judges,\" the \"Court,\" the proceedings/ trial, and even the \"Law\" itself--they all seem to be unsolvable enigmas.Now, look at yourself. You were born or made to exist without your consent. You live, you do whatever comes to your mind worth doing, you marry or stay single, maybe you've married already and are raising a family, you may be living a life of fame or anonymity, amassing riches or just getting by, happy or sad. But the whys and wherefores of all these, why you're here in the first place, why you're doing whatever it is you're doing, if you have a purpose or was just an accident, if you will outlive your physical death, see God or see darkness, witness corrective justice for all the wrongs you've witnessed or heard about--all these you do not know and never will know. Sometimes you'd think, with all these uncertainties and frightful unknowns it would have been better that you did not exist at all. But you had no choice. You're condemned to this life and had been charged. You can't \"not exist\" and escape. You are under arrest.So you seek help. You'll try religion, common sense, reason, study the affairs of men, look back in history, see what the living and dead prophets and philosophers have to say, pray to God and his saints, ask Oprah, google your questions, but all these offer no certitude. Then, you will still die, and you would die bewildered and afraid and, like the death of Joseph K. himself in this novel, your death will be no different from that of a dog--\"...Then one of them opened his frock coat and out of a sheath that hung from a belt girt round his waistcoat drew a long, thin, double-edged butcher's knife, held it up, and tested the cutting edges in the moonlight. Once more the odious courtesies began, the first handed the knife across K. to the second, who handed it across K. back again to the first. K. now perceived clearly that he was supposed to seize the knife himself, as it traveled from hand to hand above him, and plunge it into his own breast. But he did not do so, he merely turned his head, which was still free to move, and gazed around him. He could not completely rise to the occasion, he could not relieve the officials of all their tasks; the responsibility for this last failure of his lay with him who had not left him the remnant of strength necessary for the deed. His glance fell on the top story of the house adjoining the quarry. With a flicker as of a light going up, the casements of a window there suddenly flew open; a human figure, faint and insubstantial at that distance and that height, leaned abruptly far forward and stretched both arms still farther. Who was it? A friend? A good man? Someone who sympathized? Someone who wanted to help? Was it one person only? Or was it mankind? Was help at hand? Were there arguments in his favor that had been overlooked? Of course there must be. Logic is doubtless unshakable, bit it cannot withstand a man who wants to go on living. Where was the Judge whom he had never seen? Where was the High Court, to which he had never penetrated? He raised his hands and spread out all his fingers.\"But the hands of one of the partners were already at K.'s throat, while the other thrust the knife deep into his heart and turned it there twice. With failing eyes K. could still see the two of them immediately before him, cheek leaning against cheek, watching the final act. 'Like a dog!' he said; it was as if the shame of it must outlive him.\"A must read for the insanely delirious ones: those who live without thinking and therefore unaware that they, too, are indicted and are under arrest..", "Initially I thought it would be too damn sacrilegious to add this piece of classics to my account filled to the brim with trashy books but then I thought... why not?

I have long said this is one of the great works of literature, and I still think so, but I could also see how the tedious nature of K\u2019s proceedings could translate into the tedium of reading for some readers, but the growing effect for me is of a nightmare, one that many can relate to on many levels. The basic story is simple and especially given the time it was published, 1925, though still today, strange: On his thirtieth birthday, the chief cashier of a bank, Josef K., is unexpectedly arrested by two unidentified agents from an unspecified agency for an unspecified crime. We proceed without ever knowing what the crime is that K supposedly committed, and what unravels is a labyrinthine nightmare, often surrealistic, sometimes comic, ultimately terrifying. \u201cBut I\u2019m not guilty,\u201d said K. \u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake. How is it even possible for someone to be guilty? We\u2019re all human beings here, one like the other.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the priest, \u201cbut that is how the guilty speak.\u201d Interpretations of The Trial seem to occupy one (or more) of five basic camps; autobiographical (Kafka worked as an insurance lawyer and certainly understood the almost indecipherable bureaucracy of that industry in general and insurance documents in particular); political (re: Austria-Hungary social tensions of 1914 when Kafka wrote it, and prefiguring the seemingly insane logic of fascist Nazi Germany); religious (Kafka was Jewish; some of the debates seem to echo Jewish theological debates; also, is there really meaning in life, or is life just absurd? Are God\u2019s purposes ever knowable?); psychoanalytic (is K paranoid, going insane? and sociological (are we the victims of bureaucracy? Do many people really possess civil rights, or is this a myth?). \u201cIt is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.\u201d I have a tendency to say yes, all of the above, about what this book \u201cmeans,\u201d because everything fits. And why read it today? Is there a rise in authoritarianism? Are we seeing a rise in fascism globally? Is this a dystopian book such as 1984? Sounds heavy, yes? And another aspect of this book is the fact that it has this Freudian sexual charge to it, with women close to Kafka obsessed with him, and/or he with them. Adding that layer to this book makes it seem extra crazy. Sometimes funny.In many places the book seems very funny, actually; I seem to recall that Kafka, reading sections of it aloud to friends, was convulsed with laughter. It feels on the one hand tragic, a political or legal nightmare, and yet in some places it seems like dark comedy, like a Marx Brothers movie. In one place, for instance, judges read porn magazines rather than legal texts.\u201cIt\u2019s only because of their stupidity that they\u2019re able to be so sure of themselves.\u201d Maybe one sign of a great book is that it can mean so many different things to many people. If that\u2019s the case, this is a great book. It certainly changed my view of the world when I first read it and it has always seemed to me to speak to modern/contemporary existential and social human conditions.PS: I just attended the 2018 CAKE (Chicago Alternative Komix Exposition) and met Landis Blair, who published this Kafka Trial Choose Your Own Adventure book, which is not yet listed on Goodreads:http://www.landisblair.com/store/the-....", "Who Dared Seize Him?Ever since first reading this novel in school, I've assumed the word \"Kafkaesque\" described an aspect of society analogous to living under a totalitarian state.For much of this thoroughly enjoyable re-read, I persisted with this view.However, when Joseph K. is arrested with no apparent justification, he is more surprised than an inhabitant of a fascist state.

He asks:\"Who could these men be? What were they talking about? What authority could they represent? K. lived in a country with a legal constitution, there was universal peace, all the laws were in force; who dared seize him in his own dwelling?\"You'd think that, with all the hallmarks of a modern civilisation in place, you'd be free from the risk of arbitrary arrest.A natural reaction is that it might be a joke. However, it's not funny for very long, certainly not for the twelve month process K. must endure.Officials on HighApart from the apparent absence of a reason for K.'s arrest, the atmosphere isn't as oppressive as I recalled. It's inexplicable for K., yet somehow routine and unremarkable for everybody else. It doesn't evoke an outcry (except, understandably, from K.). It's as if this turn of events is uncommon, but it could still happen to any of us at any time. Not because we live in a totalitarian state, but because we might have committed a crime. But what if K. doesn't believe he has actually done anything wrong?K. isn't incarcerated pending trial. For all the empty formality of the Law, everybody he deals with is meticulous in their observance of etiquette. They're amiable, courteous, helpful and apologetic, not to mention sometimes obsequious and solicitous. Whoever is wielding this power, exercising this authority, is wearing velvet gloves:\"I don't in the least blame them, it is the organisation that is to blame, the high officials who are to blame.\"Only he can't find any trace of these high officials. He only ever seems to encounter lowly officials. Still, power is exercised and punishment occurs at this level. One official says, with a hint of the banal:\"I am here to whip people, and whip them I shall.\"The Danger of IndifferenceAll the power that is exercised against K. makes him wonder whether (like Mersault would later do in Albert Camus' \"The Stranger\") he should remain indifferent to his plight. However, here, K.'s uncle warns him that he will have no chance of proving his innocence if he is submissive. He suggests that he flee the city and come to the country:\"I only made the suggestion because I thought your indifference would endanger the case...\"A Free Man in ChainsJoseph K.'s only crime seems to be that he is a free man, going about his own business. He is a risk assessor in a bank, presumably someone educated, an intellectual of sorts, a free thinker.Early on, he says, \"A man can't help being rebellious.\" Eventually, he reflects that \"it's often safer to be in chains than to be free.\"My ConfessionAfter a while, I started to deliberate whether the novel was about authority and authoritarianism at a more generic level than the State.So, what is it that places chains on mankind? The Courts just serve the Law. Is the Law wholly rational, or does it serve some other authority? Whose justice does it dispense?\"The Court is quite impervious to proof...You must remember that in these Courts things are always coming up for discussion that are simply beyond reason, people are too tired and distracted to think, and so they take refuge in superstition.\"In the CathedralBit by bit, as the novel progressed, I questioned whether Kafka's real target was the authority that religion has over our lives.The penultimate chapter occurs in the Cathedral. Some of Kafka's language sounds almost biblical:\"The Court makes no claims upon you. It receives you when you come and it relinquishes you when you go...You see, everything belongs to the Court.\"Yet what got me speculating most was sentences like this:\"Whatever he may seem to us, he is yet a servant of the Law; that is, he belongs to the Law and as such is set beyond human judgement.\"It mightn't have been possible in the original German, but if you substitute \"the Lord\" for \"the Law\" (or \"the Court\") in these sentences, the result suggests that the greatest claim to authority is that of religion (even when it often claims to be above the Law).Is God the unseen higher source of authority and the Church the organisation behind K.'s arrest? Was it God's churchwardens who dared to seize him?Is life an ongoing trial under God's Law?Original SinIf this speculation has any legs, then \"The Trial\" might be concerned with the concept of original sin. Is original sin a crime with which each of us has been charged without our knowledge, without any proof and without any guilt? \"In the end, out of nothing at all, an enormous fabric of guilt will be conjured up.\"Free WillBy extension, if the idea of original sin derives from God, are we deluded in clinging to the concept of free will, when God sits above us all, exercising ultimate control, pre-disposing us to sin?If so, the Trial might be a metaphor for the supernatural process of God looking over and judging us every moment of our lives, until we are granted permission to enter Heaven.Ultimately, K.'s only crime seems to be the individualistic pride that makes him cling to free will and prevents him submitting to God's will and law. But in the eyes of the Lord/the Law, it is the greatest crime there is.(view spoiler)[God Works Through Trials\"2 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,3 Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.\"James 1:2-3\"Thank You Lord (For the Trials That Come My Way)\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQztF...A.K.A. The Barrister's Song (hide spoiler)]The Throng of GossipI've always thought of this novel as a five star achievement. Re-reading it, I've realised that what convinced me of its status was probably the power of Kafka's vision and ideas. What struck me this time was the quality of the writing. For all the claustrophobic abstraction, Kafka grounds the novel in evocative and descriptive prose. There's even a bit of humour:\"Down the whole length of the street at regular intervals, below the level of the pavement, were planted little general grocery shops, to which short flights of steps led down. Women were thronging into and out of these shops or gossiping on the steps outside. A fruit hawker who was crying his wares to the people in the windows above, progressing almost as inattentively as K. himself, almost knocked K. down with his push-cart.

I feel the least interesting thing about it is that it is science fiction. I mean this in much the same way that the least interesting thing one could say about 1984 is that it is science fiction. As a piece of literature I enjoyed it much more than Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake and even more than Huxley's Brave New World. The themes that make this book most interesting are to do with the social alienation of groups of people on the basis of inherited genetic characteristics. In fact, as a critique of racism this book is utterly brilliant. Those being racially alienated are genetically identical (they are in fact clones) to those attacking them.Plato believed those 'in the know' should tell lies to those 'who do not know' so as to protect them from the all too horrible truths about life. I have always hated this aspect of Plato, always finding it grotesque and frightening in its implications. Those implications are drawn out in all their disturbing horror here. This book has much to say about the nature of 'illness' and how those inflicted with an 'illness' use the scars of that illness as the badges of truly belonging to the group. So that those 'less advanced' in the ravages of the illness don't really know or really belong to the group. As a portrait of victims adopting to being victims it says much about us as humans - thoughtful readers may find it says far too much. I write this on World Aids Day.Ishiguro writes the most nightmarish novels I've ever read. In others, such as The Unconsoled or  When We Were Orphans the nightmare feeling is due to the dreamlike oddity of the interconnection of events in the story. One reads these books in much the same way that one wakes from a disturbing dream, with feelings of disorientation and anxiety. Even though this is the most literal 'nightmare book' of his I have read - the world he creates being literally a nightmare, and made all the worse by being set in the recent past - it is a book totally lacking in that strange dreamlike quality so characteristic of these other novels. In this sense it seemed less of a nightmare than these others. If you struggled with these, you will not struggle with this in quite the same way.He also has fascinating and quite painful things to say about the nature of love and how love has a proper time, a time that may be lost or missed. As someone who has loved, lost and missed I found this particularly challenging. The relationship between sex and love and illness is perhaps something people may find simply too much - not because this is handled in any way that is too explicit, but because I do believe we like to think that sex, as a manifestation of love, has curative and redemptive powers. A book that questions this, questions something we hold very dear and some readers may find this too much to ask.This is also a book about betrayal. The betrayals we commit against those we love the most and yet that we barely can understand or explain after we have committed them - these are constant throughout the book. He is a writer all too aware of the human condition. The scene which gives the book its title is a wonderful example of the near impossibility of our being understood by others and yet our endless desire for just such an understanding.There is nothing easy about reading this book - although it is written in the simplest of prose. It has an honesty of feeling that brands one's soul.I loved this book and have thought about it a lot since I finished reading it and will think about it more. There is much more I would like to say, but there is no space.

The thing that annoyed me the most about this was the fact that the things that happened (so bob and I went walking to the store and we had a fight about the tree at school) and then the writer would tell you about the tree and why it was significant, then tell you about the fight. This sort of device is interesting the first few times you see it, but it started to annoy me over time. Maybe because I talk like that, and get off into tangents and anecdotes.Also, at the heart of the store is the purpose/fate of the main characters. I get the impression that the author wanted to drop clues about it, and then reveal it so that it is a shocking twist (who's Kaiser Soeze? ;) The thing is, the references really aren't that subtle, so by the time the twist is reavealed, it's not all that exciting. Not only that, but I had so many questions at the end. Like -- these people know their fate, but they never think to question it, and, in fact, seem to be glad for it.This was supposed to be a coming of age story. Generally \"coming of age\" involves people growing up and moving forward with their lives; often they need to overcome some obstacle to reveal their potential. However, the characters seem to be stagnate the whole way through; their fate doesn't change. The blurb on the back of the book mentions that the characters, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, all have a shared background that's special, and implies that they're lucky. When two of the charaters confront someone to see if they can defer their fate (they don't even bother trying to change it), we find out a little bit of what makes their shared background special, but we aren't given anything to compare it to (we're just told that similar people have horrible existences, but not how). And they find out that they can't defer their fate, but they don't really seem to care; they don't even seem to be particularly glad that they tried.I've seen a couple of reviews compare this to book to Aldous Huxley's classic \"Brave New World\" and Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale\". Not even close. In both of these books we're exposed to an alternate reality, and we see how the main characters deal with their situations. Kazuo Ishiguro tries to sneak the alternate reality into the story, to take us by surprise.I could go on, but I won't.

There is an incredibly subtle mastery of several different genres here. Sci-fi meshes impeccably with allegory which is played out in the manner of a Gothic romance. Because the characters are trapped in all of this, the end result is (The Genre Supreme:) Tragedy.

Have you ever thought to yourself, \"Man, this movie's interesting and all, but I want to know more about that guy who owned the hotel where Sarah Conner hid from the Terminator. I bet he leads a fascinating life.\" (believe me, he doesn't.)Imagine if someone decided to write a book about this kind of person. The result is Never Let Me Go. (semi-spoilers ahoy, you've been warned) So the book is about a sort of alternate-universe England, where people are cloned and the resulting kids are raised in isolated boarding schools, spending all their time painting and playing sports and getting vague hints about how when they get older they'll have to make \"donations.\" We learn (eventually and with no drama whatsoever) that these kids were created specifically as future organ donors, and that's all they're meant for. Ishiguro introduces us to Kathy, the narrator, and her friends who lived at one of these schools with her - Ruth and Tommy. As I said, we gradually and laboriously learn about the school's real purpose, but it seems almost like a subplot, because the majority of the book is just Kathy nattering on about her school and how she and Ruth got into a fight this one time and also she had a crush on Tommy but he and Ruth were dating so Kathy had sex with some other random guys and oh my god can we get back to the organ donor thing? Seriously the whole book is like that - we get the sense that there's some creepy futuristic stuff going on in the background, but our protagonists don't care because they're too busy telling us about that one time Kathy lost her favorite cassette tape and it was very upsetting. Even when it seems like a plot's about to start, it's always a false alarm. The trip to a nearby town that the three characters take to find a woman they think may be Ruth's \"possible\" (a person she may have been cloned from) doesn't pan out, and we realize that the real point of the trip was an attempt to convince the reader that Tommy and Kathy have some sort of romantic attraction to each other. Ruth's possible, and everything it might have meant, is abandoned so that Ishiguro can have another chance to demonstrate his astonishing inability to create any kind of chemistry between two characters. And the end. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that Kathy and Tommy finally get all the answers about their school and what was actually going on, and they respond by...going about their lives in the exact same way as before. I mean, good God. Even though this is supposed to be some sort of more intellectual science fiction, I don't care. There's cloning and dystopian undertones; ergo it is sci-fi. And I like my sci-fi loud, shiny, and dramatic, with lots of explosions and computers that talk. There's a reason Harry Potter starts when he gets his Hogwarts letter, folks.

However I personally don't think that knowing the plot in advance will in any way diminish the enjoyment of this story. The beauty of this book is not in the plot, but in its execution.Another friendly warning: Never Let Me Go is for some reason often classified as science fiction. This is why so many readers end up disappointed I think. This novel is literary fiction at its finest. So if you look down on literary fiction and consider books written by authors like Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, and Jose Saramago pretentious, this is not a story for you.Now to the novel itself. Kathy, now 31, is a former student of an English boarding school Hailsham. Hailsham is a school for kids with special purpose. All education in this school is geared towards conditioning its student to accept their \"special\" destiny as a given. As Kathy is getting ready to make her first donation while being a carer for other donors, she recounts her life in Hailsham and on her own, mostly in a form of anecdotes about herself and her best friends Ruth and Tommy, their rivalries, jealousies, and affection for each other. There is nothing particularly shocking, gruesome, or intense about Kathy's story, and yet it leaves you with a sense of being a part of a nightmare.After reading quite a few reviews of the book, I can say that I loved the aspects of it that many abhorred. What other readers say about Kathy - her detachment, her lack of fire and rebellion, about broke my heart. What can be more heartbreaking than witnessing human lives wasted? Let me tell you - witnessing lives taken away from people who do not even realize what is being taken away from them, people who do not understand the value of their existence, people who do not know they have a right for more. There is of course, much more to the story. The novel explores the futility of human life, its un-bargainable eventual \"completion\" and how we all choose to deal with the inevitable end. But for me personally the pain of Kathy's quiet resignation to her fate was what stood out and touched me the most.In many ways Never Let Me Go reminded me of The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. Only Kathy is a step further from Offred. If Offred knows what horrors she is subjected to, but has no strength or will to change her circumstances, Kathy doesn't even know that her life \"purpose,\" her destiny is inhumane. This work is also, to me, very reminiscent of Ian McEwan's Atonement. McEwan is a master of subtle build-up to an almost unbearable, life-shattering moment, but Ishiguro is a master of subtle telling without telling, foreshadowing, and emphasizing the gravity of the unsaid. What else can I say about this novel? Never Let Me Go is a masterfully written work of fiction which raises questions of what it is to be human, what you choose to do in the face of an impending death and what happens when science is not accompanied by ethics. Subtle, eerie, chilling, and poignant.

Kids in the school grew up in an isolated but almost idyllic setting; not knowing their parents but realizing somehow they were \u201cspecial.\u201d After finishing school they live together in small groups in cottages before heading out into the world on their own. The story is set in the late 1990\u2019s.From the very first page we learn something is not right just from the language. We read that they have become \u201ccarers\u201d and \u201cdonors;\u201d their teachers are called \u201cguardians\u201d and later in the story a group goes out to look for an older woman who looks like one the school kids and might be her \u201cpossible.\u201d We also learn they can have sex but are incapable of having children and that after their third of fourth \u201cdonation\u201d they have \u201ccompleted.\u201d So we catch on pretty quickly what life has in store for these kids. There are some genuine mysteries though. Why does the school seem obsessed with encouraging them to do creative work, giving them awards and collecting the best work to go to a gallery that they never see? Where does it go and who sees it and why?Much of the plot is built around a three-way love story between a boy and two girls at school. All three are good friends but the boy and one of the girls are a couple. That girl is controlling and domineering and prevents the relationship between her boyfriend and the other girl from developing. Late in life a romantic relationship develops between the other girl (the young woman who is our main character) and the now-young man. In fact she becomes his \u201ccarer.\u201d Is the love they develop better than it would have been years ago? Or is it too late and stale? This quote explains the title: \u201cBecause maybe, in a way, we didn\u2019t leave it [the school] behind nearly as much as we might once have thought. Because somewhere underneath, a part of us stayed like that: fearful of the world around us, and \u2013 no matter how much we despised ourselves for it \u2013 unable quite to let each other go.\u201d I thought it was a good story; it kept my attention all the way through, although not quite as good as the author\u2019s best-known work, Remains of the Day..", "The thing I enjoy most about Ishiguro\u2019s writing is the sheer level of depth he gets into his characters; he captures all the intensity of real emotions whether they are self-serving or destructive.

Indeed, for all his talent, I don\u2019t think this novel was as effective as  The Remains of the Day  or even  When We Were Orphans. For me. this is a lesser novel by a great writer. This is his most popular work, and his most critically acclaimed, and I think that\u2019s only because of the particular themes he explores here. This is science-fiction, but I prefer the term pseudo-science fiction. It\u2019s slightly futuristic, but the fictional elements are relatively comparable to what man can do today. Vivisection transplant is nothing new. Organ donors are nothing new. This book is very similar to the movie \u201cThe Island\u201d (2005) where a select group of people have special clones bred for the singular purpose of providing them with replacement body parts. What I find interesting is how these two were released so close together. For me, such forms of artifice reflect the worries and concerns of that decade. Discussions over designer babies and animal rights issues (in regards to testing, transplants and cloning) were often in the media. If we look back to the Victorians, the elements in the literature reflected the concerns of the age. This is true for all literary movements; I just used this one for an example, but the point is I think this novel reflects an aspect of the time in which it was written. And for me that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s worthy of study, it's timely. But did I enjoy it? Not overly. Do I think it is a success artistically and dramatically? Not really. For me the novel continuously fails to deliver. The retrospective narrative remains detached from the happenings. Granted, the voice has lost all sense of hope and is looking back at a life of sorrow and incompleteness, but it just didn\u2019t have a sense of life. You could say that\u2019s because she is semi-human in the state imposed on her, but, for me, it was too despairing. And that\u2019s coming from someone who counts Edgar Allan Poe amongst his favourite authors. The inability of the characters to question the situation also somewhat puzzled me. Surely, they must have had some glimpses of thought that considered their present situation an injustice? There was a lack of inquisitiveness into the morality of the situation. And this, when paired with their complete failure of recognising their own feelings about each other, made the narrative feel slightly incomplete. They didn\u2019t seem to look beyond their own situation. As a reader, we make our own judgement calls, but where were theirs? A certain emotional immaturity, that bordered on the absurd, ran through the work. Overall, I can see why this book is so popular. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that.

The sun may have never set on the British Empire, but we Yankees have a guy who can fly faster than the speed of light.) But then I found myself alone in a big bookstore in a big city trying to divine what the angelic face on the book's cover was looking askance at (itself manipulated, no doubt, like the fictional clones whose story it was fashioned to sell) and thinking of Kurosawa's definition of art being about the ability to look at humanity in its entirety without flinching.Mulligan. I flinched.But Kazuo Ishiguro hasn't. And he doesn't think much of me. Or you. And he's probably correct in that judgment. Imagine the most genteel, tea-sipping people gathered around fine china in a flowery patterned drawing room somewhere in the English countryside. A shaft of midday sun shines through drawn curtains as they politely discuss the day's happenings. Then imagine Leatherface, Jack the Ripper, Lex Luther, Sarah Palin and Michael Jackson's dad ransacking everything around them, starting at the furthest perimeters of the house, slowly working their way toward our happy people and ultimately cannibalizing them. Then imagine both groups acting as if this is completely normal. Nary a word of protest or questioning, mind you. That's what this book is like to me.It was very difficult to read, in the psychological sense of \"read.\" The pathos was too overwhelming. I had to take a break from it, about two-thirds of the way through. I tried to tell myself that it was because I had read the bulk of it as I was hidden away in some claustrophobic hotel room, or that I found the prose tedious at times. In truth, though, it succeeds in shining a light on human nature, and I just couldn\u2019t bear to look. The story made me uncomfortable, and I hated myself for returning to it after having put it aside. I was irked by the characters, my inner-Kirk screaming, \"SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING!\" The lethargic creepiness made me realize that no, not only was nobody going to do anything, but that neither I, nor you, nor any of us, are all that different from the people who harvest these poor souls for their organs. After all, I'm a fat and happy first-worlder who less and less has a care or thought for all those who are exploited to make my life possible.We homo sapiens adapt to anything and hang our hats on the most contorted and worn rationalizations.I would grind my teeth and ask, \"Where is their Marx? Their Malcolm X?\" Fuck, I'd have settled for Stalin or Benedict Arnold. But maybe the revolutionary gene had been isolated and bred out of their clone bodies -- a distinct possibility, owing to the imperfect knowledge of the first-person narrator. What's worse is that whereas science may have manipulated them to be docile, we, all of us, have been likewise manipulated by the inertia of history.As I have written, I grew tired with what I saw as tedious prose, the catalog of details about everyday life cited by the narrator. But then it dawned on me that this cataloging is exactly the sort of thing a dying person would do. Life would take on more urgency. What you and I may take for granted is pregnant with wonder to the condemned. In fact, happy serendipity, this view is supported by a study cited in the November 2009 issue of the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin -- researchers have found that those who profess to be in love are more analytical. And what is someone condemned to die other than someone in love with life?I winced at Ishiguro's condemnation of liberal half-measures in the face of social norms. The narrator and her group of friends are raised in an almost \"humane\" manner -- educated, encouraged to cultivate personal friendships with one another, encouraged to pursue art. And while they represent the exception, an experiment to demonstrate that clones have souls, they are condemned nonetheless. All the petty jealousies and transcendent friendships that framed their short, beautiful lives, are consumed by larger society. And while there is never a mention of God, the closest they come is looking up a former instructor who is only mildly repulsed by them and who bids them eat from the Tree of Complete Knowledge.Repeat after me: I am pathetic. I am powerless.Kirk, succumbing to the Borg after all..", "I'm always excited when I run across a novel that is, so far as I can tell, essentially perfect. Never Let Me Go is one of those.

Ishiguro is a master craftsman and it shows here.The novel's characterizations are pitch perfect. Its narrative flow reveals things in exactly the right order. Mystery is preserved until it no longer matters and then, under the light of revelation, we discover the mystery was never the thing that mattered. Ishiguro plays with the reader as he unfolds his exploration of what it means to live\u2014but never does so unfairly or at the expense of his characters' right to dignity and reality (a right that he very much does grant his characters).Never Let Me Go is narrated from nearly a decade before its publication. As Kathy quietly reminisces from her vantage in the late 1990s, she gradually comes to explore a life fraught with meaning and purpose\u2014and fraught simultaneously with that kind of superlative meaninglessness that Ecclesiastes bemoans in all of its somber weariness. Kathy is a caregiver to recuperating donors and relates her special pleasure in the few instances in which she had been able to offer care to those who had been students at the exclusive (and, as it turns out, much envied) Hailsham, where she herself grew up. Memories of Hailsham water a fertile delta of memories through which we gradually come to understand both Kathy and the world she has inherited\u2014a world filled both with much light and much darkness.In other words, a world much like mine or yours. Still, Kathy's story is unique and it is in her own tale's peculiarities that our own is better revealed. Better explored.Some may be tempted to see Never Let Me Go as ethical question and admonishment to this generation of readers and to the one that follows us. Certainly, that is there, but only as mise-en-sc\u00e8ne to the larger panorama of a woman's quest to discern her past, present, and future from a glut of memories (some of which are only mostly trustworthy or even trusted) and how that journey sheds light on questions more important than mere ethical concerns. In Never Let Me Go, Ishiguro continues to play as he has in past works with memory and perception and how memory is so often the primary defense against perspicacity, yet as his narrator is acutely aware of her own remolding of history through nostalgia and forgetfulness, we are assured that perspicuity is not his target here.No. I believe Never Let Me Go is much more a perfectly plotted meditation (and its style is itself quite meditative) on the human condition, the place of our own hands in shaping our destinies, and what it means to live. These could all be clich\u00e9d topics but Ishiguro approaches with such a vaguely detached sublimity that he breathes (through Kathy his narrator) a certain verdant spirit into these things. They are never treated as anything more than mundane, but it is precisely by that treatment that he gives his purpose such power and impact..", "You know those irritating people who talk to children and old people as if they were babies, in a puerile, singsong voice?Well, those idiots sprang to mind as I endured the narrative voice of this glacially slow yawnfest of a novel.This is a book so plodding, so dreary and so pretentious that I gave up on it halfway through.With a less-than-pleased harrumph, I shoved it into a slot on my bookshelf alongside The Remains of the Day, which I'd bought at the same time, anticipating dual sublimity.

So for the past few years there they both sat, on the bookcase equivalent of a naughty step, sulking like teenagers and glaring at me each time I passed. \"Oh, get over yourselves!\" I berated, turning them around so that only their pages were on show. Ha! That taught them a lesson they'll never forget!But right now, I'm giving The Remains of the Day its day in the sun. It's highly spoken of by numerous Goodreaders, so I'm hoping that Ishiguro can belatedly turn my frown upside down.As for Never Let Me Go, the only thing that I have in common with its improbable story line is that (view spoiler)[I carry an organ donor card in my wallet, though mine are only due to be harvested after my death.

Now an adult, Kathy reflects back on her life. She charts the very slow progression of her growth, her friendships with fellow students Tommy and Ruth, and her knowledge, as she herself gradually began to learn about her role in the outside world\u0097and what this role dictates about her identity. A combination of heavy introspection and soft-scifi, Never Let Me Go has a thought-provoking premise and is brilliantly written, but fails to reach its potential, spending all its time in excruciatingly slow buildup and none of it in impact, theory, or debate. Enjoyable, but somewhat empty, and so moderately recommended.This book's greatest strength is its writing style, but it is also one of the most irritating aspects. Kathy, the narrator, is intensely thoughtful and analytical, breaking down her personal history into eras, important moments, and developing themes. She walks the reader through the story of her life much in the way she lived it, slowly, very slowly, bringing to light her final realizations. In other words, there is a lot hidden in this book, and it takes the book's entire length\u0097literally until the last fifteen pages\u0097to reveal it all. In between are circuitous examples, where Kathy starts to talk about one event, goes back a bit to explain why the event was relevant, explains the event itself, and then goes on without having drawn a major conclusion\u0097instead, she's just mapped another point on her gradual arc or argument. The resulting pace is excruciating, both artful, brilliantly thought-out and executed, and simply painful as the reader is lead along, disappointed, and lead along again. The book's pace bring the characters to life (although both Ruth and Tommy lack some dimension) and, with it, the life that they lived, through Hailsham and beyond. As such, it is the highlight of the book, worked like an artform, but it is also intensely irritating and makes the book (which actually reads quite quickly) seem longer than it is.There are a near-infinite number of issues, from the ethical to philosophical, that could be brought to question and debate in this book. The very premise almost begs them\u0097both the science of the base culture and the purpose of Hailsham itself. Unfortunately, however, none of these topics are brought to issue in the text. Instead, the book is consumed by the very slow progression of the story, the creep towards the \"twist\" revelations of who the children are and what purpose they serve. When finally revealed, these revelations are not all that big\u0097not because they lack the potential to be, but because they pale in comparison to the immense buildup that leads to them. The characters just barely exceed the gradual revelation of the book's premise and are largely just passive carriers of the story, and so the other various issues, the possible debates, never enter into the text. So when other reviewers talk about the questions this book raises, what they're really talking about is the potential for questions\u0097and that is not the same thing. The burden of meaning for this book, everything that the reader could take away and continue to think about, rests entirely on the reader, who must pull out the themes and ask the questions himself, carry on the debates himself. The author shirks his responsibility, and the book suffers for it, failing to live up to its potential.My final complaint with this book is that the underlying concept seems, blandly, unrealistic. **SPOILERS** follow, so be warned: The fact that in the book's contemporary culture the clones are considered non-human despite looking, acting, and living like humans seems entirely impossible. Consider: Humans never viewed the first cloned animals as different than their original counterparts; indeed, we were amazed and drew attention to the fact that they were identical, that they were clones. So why would cloned humans be any different (especially that these clones pass in human society as normal and indistinguishable)? Outside of the huge wastefulness of cloning entire humans just to harvest their organs, the fact that the cloned humans were not considered humans seems unreal to me, no matter who the gene donors were, no matter what brief attempts Ishiguro (though Ms. Emily) makes to justify it. **END SPOILERS** This is the underlying basis of the book's conflict and plot, and so problems with this concept create problems throughout the book. They weaken the foundations, making it difficult to accept the book and, as a result, even more difficult to take on the work of finding and analyzing themes, which the author fails too do. In the end, Never Let Me Go has a thoughtful premise with heavy potential for thought, theory, and debate, and it is skillfully, even artfully written, but the book fails to live up to its potential: the author does not tackle his own themes, and no matter how interesting the premise, it is an unreasonable one. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I did, but I felt cheated at the end: the final product was surprisingly empty, with the burden of meaning placed entirely and unfairly upon the reader alone..", "I'll admit, reading a book that you love for the second time is a scary thing. I read Never Let Me Go for the first time 2 and a half years ago, and I loved it.

But it also reminded me of the beauty of friendship, the complicated nature of relationships, the importance of art, and most importantly, the power of words on a written page to instill emotion. Now, the second time reading this book, I will admit there were some writing techniques that threw me, that I didn't recognize or at least didn't bother me the first time. I also saw some of the characters in totally different lights. Ruth seems like a terrible person, and yet this reading, 2 and a half years later, had me sympathizing with her so much more. Tommy & Kath's relationship didn't move me as much as I remember. But one thing that didn't change about this book for me is how much I love it.I love the creativity behind it. I love Ishiguro's ability to give away so much by sharing so little. I love the tone this book has, one I will continue to describe as flipping through an old, faded photo album. It's musty and opaque, yet there's a candidness to it that I adore. Ishiguro doesn't shy away from the darker parts of the world. But he is able to approach these subjects from a perspective that offers relatability and insight that is hard to recreate. It's a simple story from the perspective of a simple woman, and still it touches on so much of the complexity of human existence.

And by god truer words have never been said. Yes! I'm positive that I would not have loved it as much if I read it prior to 2009 / when I still had my 'good health'. I would even venture to say I'd probably have hated this book when I was still one of the normal healthy population. But as it happens, I met Never Let Me Go in 2013 and that fact directly impacted how I conceive the premise and the characters' thought process. The thing was I get Kathy. I get why she was so passive. I get why she resisted believing there was a 'way out' for them. Because to lose that kind of hope, that staunch a believe could be extremely devastating. And I understand why Kathy wanted to avoid that kind of heartbreak. I think, in a way, it sort of became her defense mechanism to not be passionate, about anything. To avoid all the disappointments. I felt so sorry for her. So sorry for them all. For their 'fate', for their ruined friendships, for everything.It's hard for me just writing about this book and these 'cursed' characters... It just hit me like a brick to the chest. That is all I can say....", "Very disappointing, despite a promising opening. It is a ridiculous story that is increasingly badly told.

It is a ridiculous story that is increasingly badly told. If you don't want to know the key plot point, beware of reading the back cover of some editions. :(GENREAlthough often classed as sci-fi, I think that's more because dystopian fiction is often categorised that way, rather than anything inherently sci-fi in the book itself. In fact, it doesn't even feel dystopian for a while. In many ways, it's more of coming-of-age novel: coping with loss of innocence and accepting responsibilities. STYLEThe narration is very conversational (which is fine).SETTING AND PLOTIt is initially set in a co-educational English boarding school, in a country house. There are the usual friendships and fallings out, and it has children as young as 5 (maybe younger), but in many ways it seems quite idyllic. However, there is an understated menace from the outset, and the school is oddly obsessed with creativity.The pupils' vagueness about their eventual fate perhaps shadows that of the reader. Mention is made early on about (view spoiler)[carers and donors and they are told of \"people who shudder at the very thought of you - of how you were brought into the world and why\" (hide spoiler)], but it's only towards the end that the details are made explicit. I think I might have enjoyed the book slightly more if I'd had to work it out for myself (rather than read it on the cover). The middle section is set in \"the cottages\" where the leavers go to live for a couple of years or so, and the story narrows to be more specifically about Kathy (the narrator), Ruth and Tommy. This exaggerates the contrast of the first part: they can indulge their hobbies (reading and sex, mostly), living comfortably without the need to work, but they are increasingly aware that soon things will change.LOSING CREDIBILITYThe final section follows the three of them when they leave, and this is where the book completely lost any trace of believability for me. The underlying story is too full of holes, even within its own dystopian world. I just do not believe anyone would have the means to go to such extraordinary lengths when there are far simpler, quicker and cheaper solutions. I was reminded of this when I read Under the Skin, which is also set in an apparently normal contemporary world, but has a similarly far-fetched, overly complex, expensive and time-consuming way of solving a problem.Also, why have carers travelling round the country to be with different donors, rather than each carer being based in one location? That is implausible and not even necessary for the story!I was also a little surprised that they were as accepting as seemed to be the case (view spoiler)[(not totally accepting, but pretty much), but I suppose being born and raised in what was effectively a brainwashing cult is very powerful means of making people accept their fate. Any that did successfully and permanently break away would be hushed up and not necessarily mentioned in the novel (hide spoiler)]. Finally, it goes from bad to worse, with the cheap James Bond/Blofeld trick of having one character near the end explaining everything in a rush..", "Just announced as Winner of the Nobel Prize 2017!!!

To complete, a word that implies a special kind of duty and function in the strange alternative post-1945 society described through the eyes of a couple of friends and lovers, - to complete a life, what does it take? Are you a complete human being regardless of how you were conceived? Are you complete even if you share your DNA with somebody else, somebody with higher priorities, and a more privileged position? Are you complete even if your role in society is to serve as a convenient tool for others? How much of you is shaped by your upbringing, the drilling of a rigid ideology fed to you in an omnipresent, omniscient education system, leaving no options but the ones decided upon by others? Are you complete even if you are moulded carefully to fulfill an external purpose?When you complete the mission forced upon you, is the sum of your life what you gave to society, or what you secretly stole from it to keep for yourself?For me, the answer is: you are a complete human being when you manage to see who you are, to reflect on it, and to make emotional and intellectual decisions based on your situation. If you think, see, feel and love, you are a complete human being, no matter what an oppressive, obscene and dehumanising society does to you on a larger scale. If your thoughts and feelings are yours, and you are able to share them with other human beings, you are complete. In the positive sense of the word. When you complete, you will have lived.

Is there something flagrant or collusion happening behind the consonant nature of this school? Are the students of Hailsham different in some sort of way? The author tries to tell it through the eyes of Kathy, who was a schoolgirl who leaves the school after she grows up into a young woman. How will the products of Hailsham face the stark realities of their future? This novel explores hope and hopelessness, love and betrayal simultaneously. The author is also trying to discuss the importance of ethics in science. This novel is a conglomeration of literary fiction, science fiction, and romantic fiction. What I learned from this book 1) What should we do if things are not going according to our plans in our life? If things are not going according to our wishes, we should try hard to get things back on track. Even after we try our best, if it is still not going to our wish; then, we should learn to let it go.  \"You have to accept that sometimes that's how things happen in this world. People's opinions, their feelings, they go one way, then the other. It just so happens you grew up at a certain point in this process.\"   \"I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast. And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much. The current's too strong. They've got to let go, drift apart.\"  2) The importance of solitude Everyone is so vocal about the problems of loneliness and how loneliness can lead to anxiety and depression. It is indeed an important topic that needs discussion. But most of us are forgetting about the importance of solitude. Solitude is also a vital ingredient to make a person sane, just like companionship. \u201cThe solitude, I've actually grown to quite like... I do like the feeling of getting into my little car, knowing for the next couple of hours I'll have only the roads, the big gray sky and my daydreams for company.\"   3) The purest form of Love The author tries to discuss love from multiple angles in this novel. If we try to read between the lines, we can see love from a different angle that we haven't seen anywhere else, which is unique, pristine in its purest form, and has the propensity to touch our hearts and bring tears to our eyes. \u201cYou say you\u2019re sure? Sure that you're in love? How can you know it? You think love is so simple? \u201d  My favourite three lines from this book  \"It was like when you make a move in chess and just as you take your finger off the piece, you see the mistake you've made, and there's this panic because you don't know yet the scale of disaster you've left yourself open to.\"   \"Memories, even your most precious ones, fade surprisingly quickly.

In her early thirties, Kathy reflects on her childhood and early adulthood, trying to make sense of life and where she belongs. The old headmistress may have some answers if she can track her down. Can she ever let go of her destiny and the world she was born into at Hailsham? I spent most of the book waiting for the action to kick-off, for the graduates from Hailsham to forcefully want answers, hold to account their guardians, and demand a human individual's rights over their bodies. It all seemed incredibly sedate and accepting, and I thought there may have been more investigation and refusal to accept the lives they had mapped out. The characters were one dimensional, and largely disappointing with no energy or depth. Fundamentally a story of humanity, what it means to be human. How sacred each of us is, with the dreams and ambitions and freedom to live the best life we can rather than live a life as an organ catalogue.

And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planning the other day. Your lives are set out for you.The skill how Kazuo Ishiguro paints the experiences of growing up on a boarding school, capturing the essence of schoolkids Tommy (repressed anger mixed in with a desperate wish to fit in) and Ruth (seemingly strong willed and a leader but at times lying and bluffing to get this impression to stick), is excellent.How he uses a small aside sentence, focussing on how every student of Hailsham wants to be favoured by a guardian, to feel special besides the confines of their small drawer with personal belongings, procured from secondhand shops and each other\u2019s creative output, to draw the atmosphere. Or the magic realistic child thinking of Norfolk as a lost corner of England, where everything one has lost can be found back, like the lost corner in the school.All absolutely heartbreaking when you know more of the purpose of the school.The fickleness of memory (especially when it concerns a narrator whose role is potentially morally ambiguous while looking back on the past) is another aspect that is done masterfully by Ishiguro, and will be familiar to readers of the The Remains of the Day and the An Artist of the Floating World.... ending up universally touching\u2018But think of it. You were lucky pawns. There was a certain climate, and now its gone. You have to accept that sometimes that\u2019s how things happen in the world.

Here Ishiguro even outdoes Michael Cunningham in depicting three way relationships in all their complexity.What was special for me on rereading was how for the first time I started to realise that the H. and E. as surname might not be to anonymous talk about classmate, but just a designation.We all know it. We\u2019re modelled from trash. Junkies, prostitutes, winos, tramps. Convicts, maybe, just so long they aren\u2019t psychos. That\u2019s what we come from. We all know it, so why don\u2019t we say it.Would that be true and explains Ruth lying, Tommy\u2019s anger, Kathy\u2019s urges?In the end this theory seems to be invalidated, but still that was a new perspective in rereading the book as well.There is a dark promise of what happens when humanism fails with advanced technology at hand, with the Hailsham students alienated from regular society I realized, of course, that other people used these roads; but that night, it seemed to me these dark byways of the country existed just for the likes of us, while the big glittering motorways with their huge signs and super caf\u00e9s were for everyone else.But part 3 is in its core mainly focussed around the realisation of mortality.How we, as the Hailsham students, will lose everything in the end, but keep on living on nonetheless, with this knowledge:I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast. And these two people in the water, trying to hold on to each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it\u2019s just too much. The current\u2019s too strong.

It is composed in the form of a memoir, written by a young woman, Kathy H., who looks back on her experiences as a child and, later on, as a teenager in an outlying boarding school, somewhere in England.

In many ways, Ishiguro\u2019s book also echoes Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid's Tale and that feeling of confusion and unease, but with a softer, low-key tone. Each chapter is built around one of these tiny events going on in this crooked little world, so that the mystery and suspense slowly build up, but we will hardly know what dark secret lies beneath it all until practically the very ending of the novel. A devastating, revolting reveal which is exposed in an almost pensive, resigned yet hopeless manner. It all comes down to a tragic tale about destiny and what it means to be mortal.

Hanta is portrayed as a sort of recluse and hermit, albeit one with encyclopedic literary knowledge. Hanta uses metaphorical language and surreal descriptions, and much of the book is concerned with just his inner thoughts, as he recalls and meditates on the outlandish amounts of knowledge he has attained over the years. He brings up stories from his past and imagines the events of whimsical scenarios. He contemplates the messages of the vast numbers of intellectuals which he has studied.

It is a stunningly written, very origI had been meaning to read Hrabal's classic novella for quite a while, but last night I finally picked it up. Instantly, I was transported to the world of Hant\u00e1 in a crumbling Communist Prague. Hrabal combines lyrical descriptions of the pleasures - and the necessity - of reading, with surreal passages revealing Hant\u00e1's tangible interactions with the figures in his books, in a world where reading and intellectual and creative engagement are no longer valued. It is a stunningly written, very original work in which Hrabal transcends a mere indictment of one regime, by tapping into the universal and transcendent joys of books and art, and the dangers of dehumanization that we face when we lose sight of those integral aspects of human life. Hant\u00e1 works by day compacting confiscated books and papers for recycling. He toils in a basement with an ancient compacting machine, and only mice and the occasional flies (and a gypsy or two) for company. He does not keep up with the efficient pace that his boss, and his society, demand - instead, Hant\u00e1 lets the papers pile up to the ceiling as he searches the deliveries for rare books to rescue or, in some cases, to send off to a ceremonial end in the middle of a bale, opened to a much loved passage, and decorated by art prints that were also designated for destruction. Hant\u00e1 literally is surrounded by the ghosts of writers past. His small apartment is filled to the rafters with tons of books that he has rescued from pulping, to the point that the shelves he has built over his bed and in his bathroom present the constant risk of burying him:\"The way I look at it, my life fits together beautifully: at work I have books -- and bottles and inkwells and staplers -- raining down on me through the opening in the cellar ceiling, and at home I have books above me constantly threatening to fall and kill or at least maim me. The swords of Damocles that I've hung from my bathroom and bedroom ceilings force me to make as many trips for beer at home as at work....\" (26)As he works in his isolated basement, Hant\u00e1 is visited by Jesus and Lao Tse Tung, who present him with radically different models for spiritual engagement on earth. As he walks through Prague, he is surrounded by the architectural ghosts of the classical world. His avocation rescuing and reading books has provided him with a unique education:\"I am a jug filled with water both magic and plain; I have only to lean over and a stream of beautiful thoughts flows out of me. My education has been so unwitting I can't quite tell which of my thoughts come from me and which from my books, but that's how I've stayed attuned to myself and the world around me for the past thirty-five years. Because when I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol, infusing brain and heart and coursing on through the veins to the root of each blood vessel.\u201d (6)His reading also provides Hant\u00e1 with a means to escape the dismal reality of his life:\"And I huddle in the lee of my paper mountain like Adam in the bushes and pick up a book, and my eyes open panic-stricken on a world other than my own, because when I start reading I'm somewhere completely different, I'm in the text, it's amazing, I have to admit I've been dreaming, dreaming in a land of great beauty, I've been in the very heart of truth.\" (14) Throughout the novella, Hrabal seamlessly moves back and forth between Hrabal's reveries about philosophy and books, his memories of past relationships, and his observations of the society that is literally rotting under his feet. There are long, gorgeously written passages that I am tempted to quote at length, alternating with some very disturbing images of the decay and death surrounding Hant\u00e1. In the end, Hant\u00e1's basement sanctuary cannot hide him from the forces for progress that surround him. Hrabal is known for developing central characters who seem simple, innocent, but who are more in touch with the spiritualism of life than the supposedly well adjusted, but bland, people surrounding them. Hant\u00e1 comes across as a prophet, but one whom no one notices or hears. He sees the dangers of sterile efficiency as the primary goal for a society. Through him, Hrabal leaves us with the question of the value of a life stripped of intellectual and spiritual engagement, one with all rough corners smoothed away to a bland predictability and surface gloss. The book holds tremendous power and relevance for us, even reading across the span of time and space. Note that the images on the review are taken from different film adaptations of the novella.

The solitude of existence essentially implies that we are alone, literally alone. We are condemned to be free, as existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre used to maintain, free to do as we may please. Is it a blessing or a curse? Human beings have been haunted by this age-old question since they became aware of their consciousness, for we have been evolved into conscious beings from our cousins. Once we take birth, we are condemned to be free, of course, the preliminary ventures of life are beyond our control; however, once we become self-conscious, which we eventually do, we are condemned to be free, which essentially means to make choices. We are responsible for everything we do, therefore only we and no one is responsible for our actions. There is no inherent purpose or defined model of life which may be followed to find one\u2019s true essence, existence precedes essence as put by Sartre. It gives rise to an absurd situation that may provide us the anguish of freedom as an infinite choice may there for us. Life as we know is inherently meaningless, however, it is the realization of that absurd situation that enables us to realize our true existence as put by Albert Camus. But the inherent lack of meaning of life perhaps gives rise to human suffering, the unbelievable burden of responsibility which a free man bear keeps him in a constant flux of anguish. So do we need to explore as many options as we could? More often than not, we often find refuse in sticking to a few options in the pursuit of money to propel our livelihood. But we are unable to get free from this feeling of restlessness which essentially manifests into existential anxiety, anxiety to look for some meaning, some reference to hold onto, which might free us from this anguish even if that means an inauthentic existence.Solitude may be bliss as when we are with ourselves, we may contemplate our lives, our choices, and thereby realizing our true and authentic existence. Writing may also be a kind of solitude to reach our inner abyss as Kafka used to say, to render the tumult and turbulence one might be going through while sometimes words are deftly used to concoct an escapade which may indirectly covey one\u2019s thoughts. A solitude that may be deep, dark, and calm like death could be an enriching for one to experience that all is one and one is all. However, mankind can\u2019t simply cut off with the outer world, since we need to define our boundaries in the outer physical world, to survive through mundane happenings of life with bouts of solitude interspersed among them. As we are social beings, there is a need -\u2018others\u2019 to see ourselves through their eyes in search of happiness which may essentially be inauthentic and shallow. In the background of this constant struggle between living our selves and behaving as per our \u2018social\u2019 norms, there lies utter loneliness like an abyss, a void.Literature may provide us the necessary refuge, the distraction, the medium we need to save ourselves from getting mad. For, it may act as a tool, a man always looks for, to get away from his inner tumult, it might provide the balmy, the soothing effect, even if it is illusionary, we need to brave the horrors of our existential solitude. The literature has got the ability to withstand the horrific acts of humanity, it may act as a mirror to us, which might reflect our inner-selves to us, however, more often than not, humanity is so shameless that it doesn't get ashamed even after looking into such mirror, as Hegel said-The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. Yet it is the black hole we need, which gives rise to life, which absorbs all our insolence, our despotism, abuse, exploits, perversions, and persistently reflects only the condensed consciousness of those who care for humanity-a sort of caring and nurturing magic of existence.Ha\u0148t\u00e1 has been compacting trash for thirty-five years. Every evening he rescues books from the jaws of his hydraulic press, carries them home, and fills his house with them. He has created a universe of his own embedded in our physical world. He takes refuge from his mundane, repugnant, inauthentic existence into his little universe built upon literature. The universe of Ha\u0148t\u00e1 is strange, he breathes words, eats pages and lives with Hegel, Goethe, Leibniz, Sartre, Cezannes, Kant, Schopenhauer and others from the realm of literature and art in a microcosm, hanging in a delicate balance of being and nothingness through a dirty cellar, witnessing to the struggle of mice of different colors from the underground sewers. The tyrannical weight of hydraulic press destroys pages and books by pressing them into destruction, however, it could not demolish the wisdom of those pages as indestructibility of words survives through the horror of the press to enlighten the solitude of existence of the narrator. The universe of Ha\u0148t\u00e1 may seem to be insignificant, suspended through a thin thread from the hell of nothingness, but it\u2019s the paradise created by the narrator for himself wherein he may have a one-to-one conversation with Jesus and Lao Tze, and which fulfills the abyss of loneliness of his existence. Such a world could be a paradise for any book lover, some of us may even envy of Ha\u0148t\u00e1, for there could be infinite possibilities in his world, a kind of multiverse having parallel universes existing simultaneously on the space-time continuum, wherein one move to and fro in time as if it\u2019s one of the dimensions with literature providing the force of gravity which may transcend universes and times. A world which provides the weak, downtrodden to realize his true essence, to overcome his loneliness of existence through bearing the unbearable responsibility of being free, absolutely free; to realize the true, authentic existence of himself. The novella in a way depicts the totalitarian political regime of Czechoslovakia during the life of Bohumil Hrabal or any such regime for that matter since literature has to breathe the air of oppression, tyranny, abuse, and persecution in such a nether world. However, it is the resilience of the literature which enables it to survive the horror of inhumane acts we have executed throughout our abominable history, to come out in the light of the resurrection and to breathe in the air of perseverance, and that\u2019s how the greatest literature has survived, perfectly complementing the human spirit of feisty existence in this inhumane world. This is the first time I got a chance to dip my literary senses into the world of Brabal and I find it quite enriching and delightful to hear out Bohumil Hrabal's cry for humanism amidst our indifferent world.Neither the heavens are humane nor is life above or below- or within me. 4/5*edited on 05.07.2020.", "Rare books perish in my press, under my hands, yet I am unable to stop their flow: I am nothing but a refined butcher.

In the same vein, here\u2019s the Love story of Ha\u0148\u0165a and here\u2019s a Love letter to his readers. We have a tragedy here and a tragic hero but he is not alone in his anguish and obsession. We have happiness here and a hopeless romantic, but he is not alone in his love. His solitude is loud but not deafening. The shadows of his thoughts are both sad and euphoric. He\u2019s a part of us and we are a part of him.  I'm the only one on earth who knows that deep in the heart of each bale there's a wide-open Faust or Don Carlos, that here, buried beneath a mound of blood-soaked cardboard, lies a Hyperion, there, cushioned on piles of cement bags rests a Thus Spake Zarathustra; I'm the only one on earth who knows which bale has Goethe, which Schiller, which Holderlin, which Nietzsche.Adorned with Hrabal\u2019s beautiful prose, the ballad of Ha\u0148\u0165a belongs to a world which is surrounded by darkness both literal and symbolical wherein all sorts of wars are going on. In those wars, the biggest sin is committed towards books and our protagonist is one of the unfortunate perpetrators in suppressing the words of the literary masters. The moral contradictions of his life is enough to evoke a sense of empathy and his efforts towards mitigating the effect of irrevocable curses of humanity presents a hope for fair and harmonious existence. Lost in my dreams, I somehow cross at the traffic signals, never bumping into street lamps or people, yet moving onward, exuding fumes of beer and grime, yet smiling, because my briefcase is full of books and that very night I expect them to tell me things about myself I don't know.And there\u2019s always so much to know. I talk very little when I want to talk about books in real life. It is better that way but I quietly tag along the written words wherever I go. If there\u2019s a conversation about love then I think about my lovely Jane Eyre. If someone touches upon the subject of marriage then Mrs. Dalloway stands beside me with all her regrets and whims. Italo Calvino is always there on a starry night and in the moments of melancholy, the narratives created by Javier Mar\u00edas and Carson McCullers come alive. At the end of the day though, solitude is what I yearn for. That\u2019s when the real party begins which usually brings me to this one question. A question which used to hover in my mind and the answer to which I was searching for some time. An answer in the form of some printed testimony. An answer laden with certitude, beauty and truth. An answer I can use to quiet the inquisitive utterances and to actually make others see and understand in the best way possible. The question is: Why do you read? The answer for me : This little gem of a book.

He views his job as a profession requiring a classical education and ideally a degree in divinity, which seems a bit back-to-front: he has acquired such erudition by doing the job, or by not doing it.In every bale, he puts something special, \u201clike a priest on the altar\u201d: a book open at a beautiful passage, or a print of a great painting: \u201cmy ritual, my mass\u201d.

But did someone tell me that the sea is more legendary for the turbulence it unleashes than the serenity it gifts? Perhaps that should have helped me. And Ha\u0148\u0165a. Or maybe not. \"For thirty-five years now I've been in wastepaper, and it's my love story.\" Ha\u0148\u0165a is not a man you would meet on the road; you would meet him underneath it! As you heard him, our dear Ha\u0148\u0165a has been recycling papers in his hydraulic press in a basement cellar for thirty-five years now. A failed affair, a dismantled family, no friends and a shrewd boss; you would think he was a weightless mass. But Ha\u0148\u0165a treasured his existence. And his love-story was one I could step up and embrace as my own. He was no ordinary, ragged-shirt-cobbled-shoes-torn-hat-haggard in a reclusive, submerged workplace. He was a connoisseur; connoisseur of books! Precious and banned books, in their elegant covers, finely crafted edges and embellished spines; oh, they sent him into a tizzy, especially the words wafting from the wombs of papyruses christened by flagbearers of philosophy that he would expertly secure just before feeding them to the gurgling press. In the words of Aristotle and Sophocles, Kant and Goethe, Camus and Sartre, he dissolved his solitude to see it crystallize into priceless turquoise of redefining beauty and wisdom, galloping on whose back, he conquered thirty-five years of cold shoulders and defiling glances. Recreating a literary world within his lackadaisical real world was a symptomatic victory, a roaring flush of medals of sorts that left Ha\u0148\u0165a insulated to the economic upheavals and social abandonments. But if forgiving was the name in distribution, the world would come last for anointment. Staying true to its dubious reputation, the outside world belched its ugly phlegm and the putrid liquid eventually quarantined Ha\u0148\u0165a; well, almost. (view spoiler)[A new factory, running new-age, automatic and faster wastepaper recycler machines gets erected, around the corner, in the shortest time, sending Ha\u0148\u0165a out of work almost overnight. (hide spoiler)] I am certain that Ha\u0148\u0165a was a literary doppelg\u00e4nger of Hrabal. When Hrabal finished penning this work in 1976, the politically charged environment of the erstwhile Czechoslovakia forbade him from publishing it. He went ahead nonetheless and self-published it, almost as a testament to his indomitable spirit and an ode to his feisty existence. But the next thirteen years were a tedious, exhaustive journey of moving from a suppressed voice of searing potential to an emulated voice of inspiring intellect, almost an agonizing punishment for a wise but recalcitrant writer. I suspect he lived those intermediate years, drawing strength from the books he read and the imaginations he permitted; sprinkling his reading sessions with humor and surrealism and erecting insurmountable walls of perennial refuge. There must have been excruciating periods of muffled freedom when his immediate circular cellar would have deserted him and the restorative heartbeat of his philosophical utopia may not have been audible either. (view spoiler)[I imagine this because I am a repeat offender of this literary crime. (hide spoiler)] But he continued tending to his cognitive saplings, across seasons, in all those years.

The physical books disappear, but their essence remains embedded on Hant\u2019a\u2019s tortured mind.Literature under any totalitarian system defies oppression because it gives access to alternative realities that cannot be silenced by persecution. Those living in the underworld, tyrannized by absurd authority recover the condition of their lost humanity through words written by others. Their freedom is surrogate, for it derives from the appropriation of thoughts not originally theirs. And yet they allow them to persist, to keep on fighting, to embrace abstract fellowship from a permanent exile, to feel alive amidst an inanimate existence.Literature is interxtuality printed on a page. A multidimensional universe folded in a two-dimensional support. That is why Hant\u2019a can maintain a dialogue with Lao-Tse and Jesus while greenish flies splatter the bloody wrappers discarded by the butcher and summon a Jackson Pollock\u2019s painting back to life.Literature allows the marginalized to be born again and again and to endure the leaden guilt, the horrifying weakness, the shameful need for self-preservation that prevents them from remembering what the color of happiness looked like. \u201cEvery beloved object is the center of a garden of paradise.\u201dHant\u2019a\u2019s idea of paradise is a kite with a blurred text on it soaring the azure skies of a past that has become unbearable fiction.

Other than the company of some fighting mice and some gypsies, he is mostly alone in his sacred cellar. A place where he became a refined butcher, where he mastered the art of destruction, where he learnt the joy of devastation. However, he cannot destroy everything that arrives to his cellar. So he puts some books in his briefcase and takes them to his house, a place already filled with towers of books that may kill him at the slightest sneeze....when I start reading, I'm somewhere completely different, I'm in the text, it's amazing, I have to admit I've been dreaming, dreaming in a land of great beauty, I've been in the very heart of truth. Ten times a day, every day, I wonder at having wandered so far, and then, alienated from myself, a stranger to myself, I go home, walking the streets silently and in deep meditation, passing trams and cars and pedestrians in a cloud of books, the books I found that day and am carrying home in my briefcase.

This sequence of thoughts of an old man that chose, all by himself, how his love story was going to end. Poignant thoughts that left an indelible imprint in me. Evocative lines that echo his past, his benevolent present, the desperate sense of resignation of his future. His childhood, his loved ones, his doubts, his humorous remarks that assist you when despair is too much to bear, his visions, his simple way of life, his celebration to the essence of ideas that prevail over time and defy any living soul, his impressions on a world which absurdity goes beyond imagination.No, the heavens are not humane, nor is any man with a head on his shoulders.

The blissful quietness of having no regrets. 'For we are like olives: only when we are crushed do we yield what is best in us.' (18) Hrabal, Ha\u0148\u0165a. Anyone of us. Anyone in love with literature, with ideas in the form of a book.Solitude brings to me these walls made of silence and dreams. And it is just us. This space is for us. The book and me. I hear my voice in my mind, repeating every word, processing every idea, savoring every sound. For most of Hrabal's lines are music, and I listened to it dazzled, bewildered like a child in front of a magic pipe. A melody that ignites imagination and creates an unforgettable sense of belonging. The melody of those books to which we hold onto so dearly.The melody I will be always listening to, even when surrounded by, sometimes, too silent a solitude.En una secuencia de pensamientos similar a la de esta obra, termino rememorando libros pasados, escritores que me aliviaron, personajes que me acompa\u00f1aron. L\u00edneas que, desde una inicial soledad nada ruidosa, me abrieron al mundo. Una soledad que termin\u00f3 poblada con todas las voces de ese mundo. Voces que calman. Voces que perturban. Palabras que no me dejan y que las repito para que nunca me dejen. As\u00ed, saboreando cada t\u00e9rmino, como si fuera el \u00faltimo. Aferr\u00e1ndome a cada sonido, como si fuera m\u00edo. Deleit\u00e1ndome con la similitud del sentimiento sin tener en cuenta el tiempo. Tiempo que pasa.Tiempo que ahoga.Tiempo que sana, de vez en cuando.Termino con el libro sobre m\u00ed. Con la mente m\u00e1s inquieta que nunca, embarcada en una oda a esa literatura trascendental que lleg\u00f3 ac\u00e1; desafiante, segura. Deseosa de miradas nuevas. Creadora de suspiros que evocan eternidad. Mis disculpas a las personas de habla inglesa que a veces se dan una vuelta por este sur olvidado. Pero, despu\u00e9s de leer esta conmovedora novela corta de Hrabal, \u00bfc\u00f3mo no culminar esta marea de palabras sin sentido, abrazada a mi idioma?Enamorados perpetuos del lenguaje. Sus palabras. Sus sonidos. Sus significados. Las historias que construyen. Las emociones que transmiten. El contenido sobre la forma. La escritura sobre la tapa. Coleccionistas de libros, de recuerdos, de vidas ajenas. Vidas ajenas, para entender la propia. Entender, en las cantidades que la existencia misma permite.Todo aquello que provoca sonido y que hace de la soledad, algo menos envolvente.Dec 6, 15* Also on my blog.** No, it wasn't what I expected, but I loved it anyway..", "How to write about a book that deals with compression when I am reading it thanks to dispersed and ephemeral distinctions?

For if Hrabal has written a magic and allegorical story of the character Hant\u00e1 who dedicates his life to compressing large volumes of discarded books into still voluminous bales of paper, I am reading a story which as if by magic emerges section by section on my screen acquiring in this act an additional allegorical layer.For Hant\u00e1 realizes that compression does away with differences and when censorship, which is sharp black and white, coalesces matter into colorless grey then thought and text are buried in indifferent bundles. He finds his stories on paper, on trees pressed into sheets of dried paste, all stories of constricted feelings. These are tales of confined political opinions in a decadent but still powerful totalitarian setting; narratives of repressed human liberties that try to breath through flying paper kites. And these come to me in a different world. I am dealing with them on a screen on which microcapsules, charged positively for the white or negatively for the black, arrange themselves creating the distinct shapes of letters, of words, sentences and thoughts. And every time I press the button these particles return to their amorphous sea and reemerge in a new combination. Mine is the universe of poles and discrete particles and it is from this stock of specks that the tale of an estranged world and life emerges.And this is the magic of representation. The vehicle can conjure up its opposite and offer a bewitching text which can move my heart and imagination and make me feel a solitude which, thanks to its beauty, is however not confining and certainly not too loud..", "Socialism RemainderedWas Hrabal the Studs Terkel of Moravia? He and Terkel were more or less contemporaries. From similarly humble backgrounds, they both got law degrees. Both were blacklisted and censored for questionable patriotism. Both were famed raconteurs. Most importantly, both concerned themselves mainly with working people and their culture. The difference of course is that Terkel, in his Working in particular, asks people about how their jobs gave positive meaning to their lives. HrabaSocialism RemainderedWas Hrabal the Studs Terkel of Moravia? He and Terkel were more or less contemporaries. From similarly humble backgrounds, they both got law degrees. Both were blacklisted and censored for questionable patriotism. Both were famed raconteurs. Most importantly, both concerned themselves mainly with working people and their culture. The difference of course is that Terkel, in his Working in particular, asks people about how their jobs gave positive meaning to their lives. Hrabal inquires more about how the roles people play are always ambiguously productive and destructive. For him, there is something of the symbolic and cosmic rather than the personal in each character. Perhaps this is the key to the difference in American and European moral sensibilities.Too Loud a Solitude starts like one of Terkel's case studies, a first person account of a man dedicated for thirty-five to the waste paper compaction business. Well not quite. None of Terkel's subjects ever said anything like \"If a book has anything to say, it burns with a quiet laugh, because any book worth its salt points up and out of itself.\" This working stiff knows something about iconography and semiotics.And not just about the books. Hrabal's characters themselves are like icons pointing beyond their immediate experiences: \"When my eye lands on a real book and looks past the printed word, what it sees is disembodied thoughts flying through the air, gliding on air, living off air, returning to air, because in the end everything is air, just as the host is and is not the blood of Christ.\" No ordinary sanitary engineer then in his poetic vision and singular appreciation of the doctrine of transubstatiation.The books in question, the primary raw material involved in the protagonist's production/destruction, are not allowed to become idols that inhibit their own transcendence. They possess a dialectical character for Hrabal as they bring both \"ineffable joy and even greater woe.\" The protagonist, Hant'a, reinforces this realism; he is gnostic as well as Hegelian: \"The heavens are not humane,\" he says, and \"books have shown me the joy of devastation.\" Books are the centre of his existence, but they are nonetheless tainted and therefore not to be worshipped as divine.I manage a small academic library, so I recognise the syndrome Hant'a demonstrates. He is constantly distracted from his duty to crush the books by the irresistible temptation to read the damn things. Not an efficient trait in either a librarian or a book compactor. The equivalent of a doctor's emotional involvement with her patient. Frequently dangerous. Always frowned upon. His addiction is controllable to the extent that he does fulfill his duties, if on occasion only barely.But reading of the condemned books is only the entry level drug for Hant'a. Hard core addiction is bringing the space-eating things home. They quickly take over your life. And taking up all available house-space is only the half of it. The threat of death by book-avalanche is constant. As it is, Hant'a had already shrunk by a good four inches under the compressive weight of the books in his bedroom. The books are not merely a monkey on his back, they constitute the world he inhabits and that inhabits him.Aside from a distinct preference for Schiller and Goethe, Hant'a's workaday world is not unlike many of Terkel's subjects. He's over-qualified for the job of pressing first the green button and then the red button; with a nag for a boss; and he drinks too much beer at lunch, and for that matter even on the job. By no standard can he be considered passionate or even interested in his job except for the unauthorised side-benefits. The job itself is irrelevant to Hant'a's identity, just as is his participation in a socialist state. Hant\u2019a\u2019s fear of technological redundancy is, however, as real as that of one of Terkel's subjects in capitalist America. Ever since a gigantic new machine was installed in a neighbouring town, he knows his days in book-compacting are numbered. In fact he looks forward to retirement. But he desperately wants to bring his now surplus compactor home with him since he's not sure he can do without the daily routine of waste paper disposal. He's not worried about income in retirement, however, and certainly not the loss of social routine. The problem is where to source a reliable flow of good books!Not Terkel then.Postscript: just to demonstrate that truth is stranger than fiction, this little news piece from Turkey showed up in my \u2018feed\u2019: http://forreadingaddicts.co.uk/news/t....", "I read this on a train so was able to continue without a break until the book was finished, and since the narrator\u2019s world is quite compacted, such a reading felt right.

The first paragraph was sublime, with sentences such as this: I am a jug filled with water both magic and plain; I have only to lean over and a stream of beautiful thoughts flows out of me. Or this one: Because when I read I don\u2019t really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol, infusing brain and heart and coursing on through the veins to the root of each blood vessel.After that glorious first section, I read on swiftly, looking for more such treasures, and there were other treasures, even some unexpected ones, though none quite so delicious as those in the first paragraph.\u00a0This is an unusual book, an open critique of all fascist regimes, but done in a wonderfully oblique way; the narrator, a fairly miserable individual at first acquaintance, seems a most unlikely character to pose a threat to the regime, and yet he successfully carries out his own subtle protest against censorship for more than thirty-five years, making daring literary and artistic statements under the very noses of the authorities. In the end, it is not the authorities but progress that catches up with him.Bohumil Hrabal gives us a different view of Prague, different from any that I have read before; we are far from the Castle or the Charles Bridge; this is the view from the sewer. Whether through water, earth, air or fire, we are all destined to be be recycled. .", "\"Each of us had a decent home library of books we'd happened to rescue, and each of us read those books in the blissful hope of making a change in his life.\"What if ideas no longer had permanence?

What happens when you can't escape your world to suddenly find yourself in a distant land, surrounded by emotional truth and beauty and culture?When I start reading I'm somewhere completely different, I'm in the text, it's amazing. I have to admit I've been dreaming, dreaming in a land of great beauty, I've been in the very heart of truth.After reading this beloved Czech classic, I sat in my home library for hours, just to feel the magic of my books, to embrace the warmth they exude, for books mean so much more than words on a page. Maybe this is why it was difficult to write a review for this book. Still, I knew I had to write one; if only as a homage to the printed word. And yet I feel guilty, as though I owe my narrator, Hanta, an apology for reading this on my Kindle (of all the books to read on the electronic device, I chose this one). When my eye lands on a real book and looks past the printed word, what it sees is disembodied thoughts flying through air, gliding on air, living off air, returning to air, because in the end everything is air.Here, melancholy brews and solitude reigns. But it is the kind of solitude you feel from someplace deep and unknown, the unexplainable comfort you have when you pick up a good book and don't want to be distracted by anything that will take you from within the text: Because when I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liquer until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol.Hanta is a peculiar narrator; a hermit and lover of rare books and intellectual meanderings. He is a solitude who is not lonely. I'm simply alone, living in my heavily populated solitude, a harum-scorum of infinity and eternity.It wasn't hard to relate to the idiosyncratic Hanta, this nonconformist who spent thirty-five years (this he will tell you repeatedly) compacting wastepaper. And by wastepaper, I do mean \"Paul Gauguin's Bonjour M. Gauguin\". Who cares if his boss despised him, and his peers made fun of him? Hanta surely didn't, because he lived beautifully:My life fits together beautifully: at work I have books--and bottles and inkwells and staplers--raining down on me through the opening in the cellar ceiling, and at home I have books above me constantly threatening to fall and kill or at least maim me.Bohumil Hrabal was a poet and a member of an underground writing group. When troops from the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia, he was banned from publishing. No wonder why his prose is such beautiful melancholy, and his narrator a man skeptical of the world and protective of the printed word. Hrabal writes with political subtleties and symbolism that makes you want to applaud a work which stands for so much more than Hanta. This stream of consciousness narrative is one I don't usually love, and yet it fits this narrative. This book isn't for everyone, I don't think, but it is one that you savor for all of its delicious delicacies and thematic undertones that whisper: protect the printed word, protect your intellectual freedom. Perhaps Bohumil Hrabal also knew the sound of loud solitude:Suddenly one day I felt beautiful and holy for having had the courage to hold on to my sanity after all I'd seen and been through, body and soul, in too loud a solitude..", "I can be by myself because I'm never lonely, I'm simply alone, living in my heavily populated solitude, a harum-scarum of infinity and eternity, and Infinity and Eternity seem to take a liking to the likes of me.\"Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 of Too Loud a Solitude would be friends with me if he were on goodreads.

He would so! So what if I haven't read Hegel or Kant? So what if I could only quote from Terry Pratchett (a wise man in his own write)? The books are his whole life and he talks about them as if nothing would stand in his way if there were a two-way mirror between himself and the innermost face behind the face of the books. They would have forever to get to know each other. I envy Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 the way the words live on his tongue as if they could be uttered in the moment of need to bring light. I wonder if I did read any philosophers would they be of any comfort to me too. I tell myself stories as if I could step out of reality and into the one I'm creating inside. If Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 were on goodreads I would look at the computer screen (okay, I've already admitted that I use an ipod touch screen for 98.9% of my goodreading so there's no point in lying here now) and it would be like there was a window to look through between us. Books are real! Books matter and books are everything if you're one of us. It hurts Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 to compact the scarecrow wanting its brain of ink sentences, and the lion with its if I only had courage you can't judge a book by its cover and the tin man with its heart made of paper glued to binding that holds everything together with an indestructible spine. Can they become something else, something better, and have meaning when they are killed? Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 might be one of those drunk book reviewers on goodreads, though. He has to have beer to read. I wondered if he drank so much to be like me. I don't think I would ever need to do that to write a review either. I would just throw up in the toilet when I remembered what I admitted to the morning after. Ha\u00f2t\u00e1's grandfathers and their fathers saw faeries at their elbows bar side, and Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 Jesus and Lao-tze as the ebb and flow in the pool he's face down in. The sword of Damascus hangs over his head every night. He sleeps beneath tons of books. Their weight could be that of your baby reminding you that you have to get up in the morning, or the ghost cat or old person who steals your vital energy through your breath. Six feet under and as high as cloud nine. Names theirs and do you know what you know or do you know what they know. If you were an actor and went to their acting school you wouldn't remember if you ever had natural talent. Remember your lines! I know that it hurt me when he sacrificed priceless whole libraries to be sent by train for some low money amount that I don't remember because the only European money I've held are Euros and Hungarian currency. Anyway, it's peanuts like Canadian couch coins. Hurts! His most precious favorites make like a library and book for the hydraulic press. Entire print runs bite the callous hands of children before his eyes. No one will ever love them and he cannot save them all. If he were goodreads friends with me he might not want to save my favorites. You know when goodreads separated from amazon? I rescued one of Manny's Brigade Mondain books. Ha\u00f2t\u00e1? Would you? No, he'll never sleep tonight, Mariel! He'll be up adding back all of those trashy covers to the entire well beloved French series. Book lover's guilt. It haunts me that I buy so many books that I haven't read. I still buy more. It looks like you aren't alone when you feel a responsibility for what you have loved. Would he take it as far as I do?I had a feeling while reading Too Loud a Solitude that it would not be a favorite book of mine, despite Ha\u00f2t\u00e1's last vestige of humanity attachments for his favorite words that I could relate to so very much, if his love didn't become a story of its own. I would have to think about him beyond them. Somewhere in his making connections between the mice and their mice mamas subsisting in his cellar it happened. They shared it with him. I can use that. I can see that. If he were me those mice would be from Terry Prachett's Maurice and his Educated Rodents. I don't have mice! Maybe certain people on goodreads would think my birds were no better than rodents but those people would be wrong! Or they might think that my chihuahua resembles a rat in certain lights. Wrong! Only my swiss cheese rat trap memory. Sometime in 2011 I removed some of my favorites because I had some dumb idea it should be more selective. I regret that because I need all the friends I can get. So the educated rodents would love to read Ha\u00f2t\u00e1's books (maybe Pork 'N' Beans would dig The Metaphysics of Morals. My favorite Kalix from Martin Millar's books is illiterate. She would eat On Tranquility of Mind). Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 thinks milk is disgusting and I am lactose intolerant (like him I even bring up this useless fact in book reviews from time to time). I would go with him to watch in disgust the efficient new book destroyers across town. It does not kill them to waste the paper. \"It never ceased to amaze me, until suddenly one day I felt beautiful and holy for having had the courage to hold on to my sanity after all I'd seen and been through, body and soul, in too loud a solitude, and slowly I came to the realization that my work was hurtling me headlong into an infinite field of omnipotence.\"I'm relieved, although I am a bastard for saying this considering the way that Ha\u00f2t\u00e1 goes the way of his books, that someone else agonizes over this shit. I'm half way through William Faulkner's Light in August during the writing of this review and Joe Christmas has done my head in on my books and solace and the place where you can relate to others and be safe from expectations and too loud a solitude. I wish I had a philosophy. I wish I had words of solace and shit to believe in instead of just telling about make believe people and book to eyes connection. It may be too soon to tell. Maybe I'll figure it out. (Okay, I'm too damned sensitive.) I start to worry that the books don't want me either.When I was younger I liked to \"collect\" descriptions of people in books. I can't tell you how fucking bored it makes me when a writer trots out 'beautiful' (which is tragically all the damned time, as if ANY asshole couldn't do that same thing). 'Solitude' had a great one for one of Ha\u00f2t\u00e1's girlfriends (I also loved that he envied her becoming the sort of person that other people would want to write about. I would tell you which author I think would write about me but people might laugh at me). Anyway, I liked this:\"Manca had gray hair now, but she wrote it in a kind of reformatory cut, a crew cut, like an athlete with a touch of spirituality; one of her eyes was lower than the other, which gave her a distinguished look, and if she seemed to squint a little, it was not because she had bad vision but because one of her eyes had simply got stuck while staring beyond the threshold of the infinite into the very center of an equilateral triangle, into the very heart of being, or as a Catholic existentialist once put it, her defective eye symbolized the diamond's eternal blemish.\"Books aren't solitude if you think about people like that because you were sitting alone taking the time... If you started to think about people you met to describe them like that (it is why I used to collect those). Yeah, to take the time. Words that are yours and words that are theirs and then they are yours because you took the time. I don't know about destruction. I wasn't giving up yet. (I would get damned emotional about it. It would eat me alive. My eyes would be raccoon eyes. I would read another book and hope to feel alive again. Books will love you back!) I would have probably invented some reason to put books into that hydraulic press too. What if I had to destroy a Kawabata? The hydraulic press wants to read! Look, that's his eyes and that's his mouth and he's one of those annoying kids from elementary school that read aloud and took too long when you were already into the story. Now he is crying because the story moves him. He loves to read. He'll probably be awfully popular on goodreads. (It only took me two hours and twenty one minutes to despise and strike this one from the feed. I'm not floating, really, I'm putting it back. I understand feelings of unworthiness when it comes to vocalizing about the things you love. Why couldn't there be a hydraulic press to squeeze out one's own drippiness in? I'd put me into that. Really I would. I have book lover's guilt of a different kind but I have it and boy did I relate to this book. The key is to keep drinking! More books.).", "On a lazy summer day, at the age of 5, I made my first true friend. As I stared deeper into its face, I begged, pleaded my mother to let me be friends with this elegant thing.

Even with a stubborn promise of practicing my cursive writing for an hour daily, it took my mother more than a week to be able to allow me to bring this new friendship in my life. Over the years, I have made several friends and have been at the receiving end of the love-hate relationship for decades. Some have chosen me and some I have chosen. We do not get to choose our families, so I take a bit of an extra effort in choosing my friends. Along the way, some of them have being embraced, some thrown amid a fit of rage, some ignored, some misplaced and then there have been those who have cured my reclusiveness. And, now all my dear ones, old and new, live together with great camaraderie behind the wooden door waiting to be picked up for some friendly banter. My parents gave me a loving heart, the school and streets taught me discipline, but it were the books that made me human; they bestowed me the gift of a liberated soul that harbors no prejudices and appreciates other people irrespective to their stations in life for they have innumerable stories that are yet to be heard and written. Hant\u00e1 too had a story yet to be told and when those precious sentences flowed from his mouth emitting the fragrance of a freshly sucked fruit drop, copious tears ferociously rushed down my cheeks ignoring my gentle pleas as they rested on my fingertips; the green and red buttons flashing in the background.\u201cIf I knew how to write, I'd write a book about the greatest of man's joys and sorrows. It is by and from books that I've learned that the heavens are not humane, neither the heavens nor any man with a head on his shoulders\u2014 it's not that men don't wish to be humane, it just goes against common sense.\u201dAs the door of the cellar opened, through the beaming sunlight descended the prized words of Goethe, Sartre, Hegel, Lao-Tze and many more; a steady shower of erudite sentences that peeked through the crumpled sheets of paper, verses that may never see daylight again, it was as if the inhumane heavens gifted Hant\u00e1 the gems of mankind for the final time as a tribute to the admirable artist. For thirty-five years, the mulish sounds of the cold metal obeying the marching orders of the green and red lights , shuddered through the dark interiors of the cellar as the radiance of education dispersed steadily in the beer-laden core of Hant\u00e1\u2019s physicality. Hant\u00e1 was a connoisseur of books for he knew to identify a Goethe from a Schiller and scout a Nietzsche reading like a Homeric prophecy. Hant\u00e1 called himself a \u201crefined butcher\u201d. What a tragedy! A man who crushes paper for a living perceives his work as a slaughtering fest, while those who massacre guiltless lives bestow themselves with honorary badges of \u201chumane leaders\u201d. Those who slay libertarian expressions revel in their wreckage while those like Hant\u00e1 bear the burden of the putrefying corpses. In the dense solitude following the peripheral mayhem, Hant\u00e1 was a passionate audience who knew the merit of fighting for free speech, but inopportune circumstances made him experience the pleasure of wreckage, for obliteration is all he saw as his youthful illusion drowned in the Olympic beer pool.\u201cAnd while the sewers of Prague provide the scene for a senseless war between two armies of rats, the cellars are headquarters for Prague's fallen angels, university-educated men who have lost a battle they never fought, yet continue to work toward a clearer image of the world.\u201dThe white mice annihilated the brown ones and then the triumphant white ones indulged in a war of their own, humiliating their own mates. The sewers of Prague were plagued by a battle that went on years to come. A city, a country, in the midst of turmoil butchering their own kin for egotistical prejudices, squalor contaminated the blissful lives smothering it with faeces of brutality and discomfiture splashing everywhere, just like those that had soiled the ribbons of Manca bringing ignominy and relinquishing her glory. Through Hant\u00e1\u2019s empathetic words, Hrabal paints the distorted reality of his homeland (Czech Republic) that saw democracy decaying in the graves dug by the tyrannical elements of Communism. Hrabal\u2019s country saw a melee of wars that rose through decades of inhumane treatment, bloody revolutions and ultimately liberation. For decades, Hant\u00e1 regularly dug literary graves beneath the sturdy hydraulic press and his country massacred free speech and social equality. During the onset of a political spring (Prague Spring, 1968), the country exhaled in the air of emancipation as bans on travel, speech and media were lifted. Nonetheless this heaven was a temporary respite and once again the country crumbled into depths of obscurity. Heaven is far from being humane, isn't it? While the livid rats were combating for the supremacy over the sewers, Hant\u00e1 was haunted by the ghosts of the deceased books, every trampled mice making Hant\u00e1 lose an ounce of compassion from his soul.Why do we read books? What do we achieve from these books? Do books make us heartless or is it that we are blind to the humanity that resides within the pages of the book? Are books really that cruel? Is free speech demonic? The world is filled with idiots and these very idiots carry the traits of idiocy into the core of the tomes that are brutally ripped apart as if confiscating a disagreeable existence of life. The notion of Hrabal\u2019s cherished words being ripped apart by political callousness and his books being treated far worse than a leper, brings excruciating pain.\u201cI put a Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant, and the flesh flies went berserk, attacking the last bits of dried and drying blood with such gluttony that they failed to notice the drum wall crushing and compacting them, separating them into membranes and cells.\"In a land, at a time when guns were favored over pens, agonizing screams were audible than free speech, morality was a festering corpse and Hrabal\u2019s books were sinners of human race. In the former sovereign Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), Gypsies were once privileged citizens of country that took pride in their ethnic culture. Only if, Hegel and Schopenhauer had not waged a confrontation, only if the words of Sartre and Plato had not crossed the wrong street corner, only if numerous pages were not crushed under the gigantic hydraulic press after every war; then the gorgeous gypsy girl would have been able to cook warm food for Hant\u00e1 and lie down beside him in a loving embrace as Hant\u00e1 happily sucked on to the fruity aromatic sentences from his books. In the mournful shower of wrinkled paper, the inhumane heavens had washed away the last lingering traces of kindness and love.\u201c...until suddenly one day I felt beautiful and holy for having had the courage to hold on to my sanity after all I'd seen and been through, body and soul, in too loud a solitude, and slowly I came to the realization that my work was hurtling me headlong into an infinite field of omnipotence.\"The cat is a coward when it does not let the mice squeak. The narcissistic mind is atrocious when it exterminates words from other minds. The voices of solitude burned, its ashes flowing through Hant\u00e1\u2019s body and soul and from Hant\u00e1\u2019s solitary wisdom came the courage to find beauty among the crackling noises of human bones. The age of industrialization brought with it an eccentric world alienating the old loyalists. With each new compacter established, the fears of the collector becoming the collection burgeoned among heaps of wastepaper whilst mocking Sisyphus as Camus was shredded into white confetti. Paper was being recycled, so were the books and inked words, all of them recycled ushering a new era; sadly lives cannot be recycled and are forever jammed in a claustrophobic time-zone praying for a miracle like those discarded pages of a book, hoping to be saved .The man who guards the cemetery somehow values life much more than those who walk past it, for he is surrounded by the stillness of death. To me, Hant\u00e1 was a not a refined butcher. Hant\u00e1 was clandestine priest who eulogized the books wishing that they would bestow the gift of humanity to the merciless heavens. After all it is a love story. Yet, in love and war, commonsense is not a commonplace. Lao-tze says,\"to be born is to exit and to die is to enter?\" Does he mean to exit and enter the realms of humanity through commonsense and compassion?Hant\u00e1, the man who made me cry the entire night, only to befriend me the very next day, marking the beginning of a life-long friendship.

While in the former story the young protagonist could find some solace in a (questionable) act of heroism, the latter ends with a very intense, tragic and at the same time beautifully symbolic curse of protagonist Ha\u0148t\u00e1 directed at dehumanized society. The enchanting irony of this book is that of all people Hrabal chose a 'professional book compresser' (\u201cthirty-five years I compress old paper and books\u201d) to confront us with this dehumanization: Ha\u0148t\u00e1 grinds/crushes/compresses the books into old bales, but he also cherishes those books, extracts the best and most beautiful of them out of the pile, cites Kant, Rimbaud and Hegel, and decorates the bales of old paper with beautiful covers of art books. Moreover, Ha\u0148t\u00e1 simultaneously is a manual worker, an artist-intellectual and, through his journeys through the sewers of Prague, also a connoisseur of the seamy side of modern society. His descriptions are (involuntarily?) reminiscent of the Kafka of the 'Metamorphosis' and 'The Penal Colony', although that may be too obvious a comparison; perhaps Piranesi's darkest work is a better reference. The clever thing is also that Hrabal evokes a whole, drowsy world in just over 90 pages and adds a striking, dramatic point to it, a settlement with the blind-mechanising, disenchanted world. To me this is one of the darkest novels of the 20th century.[image error].", "When he\u2019s not rescuing books for his two-ton personal collection, Ha\u0148\u0165a\u2019s job is to compress books into pulp fashioned into bales.

As another author whose name escapes me right now : we all live in the gutter, but some of us look up at the stars. In a hole in the ground, in the old city of Prague lives a man named H'anta. All day long he struggles with mountains of discarded paper, pressing them into square boxes of pulp, fueled by gallons of beer and visions of saints and sinners, philosophers and poets. Every now and then, from the mountains of garbage that is thrown down the manhole of his cellar, H'anta extracts a rare and precious book or two: For thirty-five years now I've been in wastepaper, and it's my love story. I am a jug filled with water both magic and plain; I have only to lean over and a stream of beautiful thoughts flows out of me. My education has been so unwitting I can't quite tell which of my thoughts come from me and which from my books, but that's how I've stayed attuned to myself and the world around me for the past thirty-five years. Because when I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol, infusing brain and heart and coursing on through the veins to the root of each blood vessel. H'anta is a dimwit and a slacker in the eyes of his boss, a dirty drunkard to the straightlaced people passing him on the street, a hermit living alone in a small room filled with the thousands of volumes he salvaged from pulping during his long career: Lost in my dreams, I somehow cross at the traffic signals, never bumping into street lamps or people, yet moving onward, exuding fumes of beer and grime, yet smiling, because my briefcase is full of books and that very night I expect them to tell me things about myself I don't know. In between singing hymns to the glory of the written word and reminiscing about his youth and his lovers, H'anta tries to come to terms with a younger generation that has little use for the wisdom of the elders and for preserving the masterpieces of the past, with the backstabbing, the greed, the envy of those hungry for power ( I knew I could remove any gate or manhole cover in the city and climb straight down into the life-and-death struggle, the rat war to end all rat wars, and I knew it would end with a celebration lasting only till they could find a motive to start fighting again. ) . The barbed social commentary and the openly critical view of the socialist society being built under duress have led to the initial banning of the text in his home country, but I would argue that the story of the man who invents himself through the books he reads and of the society who discards the past and the future in order to live only in the present of instant gratification transcends borders and political colours to address the larger questions of how to make sense of the lives we live and how to break free of our solitude and reach out to touch another human being. I have a physical sense of myself as a bale of compacted books, the seat of a tiny pilot light of karma, like the flame in a gas refrigerator, an eternal flame I feed daily with the oil of my thoughts, which come from what I unwittingly read during work in the books I am now taking home in my briefcase. So I walk home like a burning house, like a burning stable, the light of life pouring out of the fire, fire pouring out of the dying wood, hostile sorrow lingering under the ashes. H'anta shares with other characters from Hrabal novels an extraordinary zest for life, a boundless capacity for joy and a wild abandon to the senses. Drunken parties, dances with village girls, a passionate affair with a gypsy woman, trains running in the backyard garden of an uncle, narrow streets in the Old Town under the moonlight are all part of the landscape through which H'anta moves in silence, observing everything but remaining closed in his carapace of solitude. The humour is often irreverent, with numerous scathological references and fascination for the morbid and the grotesque. And every beautiful moment of H'anta's recollections has its 'thorn', its often brutal shove back into the gutter : No, the heavens are not humane, nor is any man with a head on his shoulders. Like the mice that nest in the moldy paper of H'anta's cellar, an individual would get crushed in the press of an indifferent Fate, be it in the form of blood filled paper from the butchers, of Nazis deporting the carefree and innocent Gypsies, of college professors working as pest control in the sewers, of the march of Progress making the cranky press where H'anta spent 35 years of his life obsolete, replacing it with an impersonal and highly efficient modern machine that has no time and patience to browse and salvage anything from the trove of discarded dreams.In a novel filled with metaphors and symbols, two rays of hope, two avenues of contentment remain available to H'anta : - the higher plane of intellectual debate where he holds conversations with Jesus and Lao-Tze, pits Hegel against Schoppenhauer in order to arrive at the destination of Kant, clothes himself in posters of van Gogh's luminous nightscenes or Gaugain's exotic savages; \"Two things fill my mind with ever new and increasing wonder \u2014 the starry firmament above me and the moral law within me,\"\tKant (Theory of Heavens)  \"The highest law is love, the love that is compassion,\"\tArthur Schoppenhauer - the original innocence of our beginnings and the nomadic/wandering nature of our spirit as illustrated in the gypsies coming in and out of H'anta's life: While we were running around with clubs in our hands and hides on our loins, the Gypsies had their own state and a social system that had been through two declines; and today's Gypsies, who have lived in Prague for only two generations, light a ritual fire wherever they work, a nomads' fire crackling only for the joy of it, a blaze of rough-hewn wood like a child's laugh, a symbol of the eternity that preceded human thought, a free fire, a gift from heaven, a living sign of the elements unnoticed by the world-weary pedestrian, a fire in the ditches of Prague warming the wanderer's eye and soul. In the end, the loss of his cosy lifestyle among lost books may prove too much for H'anta and he will turned his back on a cold, unfeeling world. The ending is maudlin and devastating on the soul, giving some substance to the theories surrounding the author's accidental death: What I saw was a large gilt upright bathtub with Seneca lying upright in it just after he had slashed the veins in his wrist, thereby proving to himself how right he was to have written that little book I so loved, On Tranquillity of Mind. An autobiographical element is easy to identify in the work. Hrabal himself worked for some years pulping recycled paper in Prague and using the time to find and read rare books. He also had seen two editions of his books sent to the thresher after being printed and prepared for distribution. Most impressive is an oblique reference to the condition of the poet in the modern world, where he is much less respected and harder to get noticed than in past centuries: \"Gentlemen, I am the hangman's assistant,\" whereupon he left, pensive and miserable. Perhaps he was the one who, last year at the Holesovice slaughterhouse, put a knife to my neck, shoved me into a corner, took out a slip of paper, and read me a poem celebrating the beauties of the countryside at R\u00edcany, then apologized, saying he hadn't found any other way of getting people to listen to his verse. Hrabal is not the only modern poet who turned to prose in order to get his work noticed. Last week I read James Sallis, Michael Ondaatje has been one of my top authors for years, Italo Calvino I view also as a poet disguised as a novelist, and the list could probably go on and on. Back to Hrabal and this half novella, half tragi-comic farce: I wish I had Ian Graye talent to improvise free verse, but I don't so I will close with one extracted directly from a book that I would quote from the first to the last line, if it were possible: Three youngsters in a corner are playing a guitar and singing quietly, everything that lives must have its enemy, the melancholy of a world eternally under self-rejuvenation, that beautiful Hellenic model and goal, classical gymnasia and humanist universities. But in the sewers of Prague two armies of ratsare locked in a life-and-death struggle. The right leg was a little frayed at the knee. Turquoise-blue and velvet-violet skirts. Helpless hands like clipped wings. An enormous side of beef hanging from the hook of a provincial butcher's.I hear toilets flushing. .", "4.5/5I chose to read Bohumil Hrabal\u2019s Too Loud a Solitude because I had loved Rabih Almeddine\u2019s An Unnecessary Woman, and two of my Goodreads friends (thanks Dolors and Jibran) thought that if I liked that book, I surely would appreciate Hrabal\u2019s short novel as well.

And that quickly I became hooked on this book. Hant\u2019a, has, for thirty-five years,been working alone in a basement (with the company of colonies of mice) running a compacting press and bundling wastepaper, readying those bundles to be sent to their end in an acidic bath. He estimates he processes two tons of books a month, and his view of books differs radically from that of the powers that have categorized books as wastepaper. He sees the books and also sees what\u2019s in them. He rescues some of them for his apartment; his entire apartment is so over-stuffed with books that he worries that an earthquake would cause all those books to bury him alive. He rescues others for friends. And those he does compact, he reads first, soaking up the human knowledge, moving it from inside the books to inside himself. Books are both things and the thoughts inside them; they can be burned, but human knowledge cannot be so easily destroyed:When my eye lands on a real book and looks past the printed word, what it sees is disembodied thoughts flying through the air, gliding on air, living off air, just as the host is and is not the blood of Christ.After thirty-five years, Hant\u2019a\u2019s run as destroyer of the bodies of books and savior of the souls of books comes to a halt. He is sent by his employer to look at a plant using a new compactor. There, young men toss everything in without a thought as to what is inside. The work is completed quickly and cleanly. These young employees finish the work of crushing books into pulp with cheerful and mindless energy. It is only a matter of time when Hant\u2019a\u2019s boss will bring them and their new and better machine in to take Hant\u2019a\u2019s place. But while those newly hired workers will destroy the books quickly and cleanly, they cannot harm not the souls of books, which will continue to survive in the Hant\u2019a\u2019s mind, in the minds of all the readers of the world.The ideas in the books possess Hant\u2019a and his world entirely; in this slender novel Hrabal makes those ideas come to life, sometimes literally. Jesus and Lao Tsu come visit Hant\u2019a in his basement workplace. They offer him their different versions of solace. He sees the stories of the past when he walks through the streets of Prague. Hant\u2019a may be a little bit eccentric, but the ideas that were once on the pages of books now permeate his mind and spirit. The book was first published in 1976 while Czechoslovakia was still under strict censorship by the Communists, who invaded in 1968 to end a period of Czechoslovakian liberalization. It would seem this book is then a reaction against Communist imposed censorship. Indeed, Hrabal self-published the book; it was not \u201capproved\u201d by the government until more than a decade later. Even though it seems all may be lost when the new regime takes over Hant\u2019a\u2019s job, as it must have seemed as Communist tanks invaded Prague in the summer of 1968, the ideas and viewpoints inscribed in the books in the libraries of the world survive even this attempt to censor and limit. Hrabal\u2019s novel is a powerful statement proclaiming the inability of tyranny to destroy ideas..", "\"For thirty-five years now I've been in wastepaper, and it's my love story.\"These words launched an ineffably beautiful story about one man's love for the world of books.

I believe \"Too Loud A Solitude\" will speak to anyone who lives in words and cannot imagine a life apart from books. The narrator, Hanta, worked at a hydraulic press as a paper packer. He salvaged rare books from the piles of old papers condemned to being compacted. It was a dream job for its wide doorway to truth and beauty. Hanta likened himself to a filled water jug. When tipped, \"a stream of beautiful thoughts flows out of me.\"The description of Hanta rescuing a book, sniffing its print, and placing it like a treasure in a crate of splendid things moved me. To Hanta, crushing books was equivalent to crushing human skeletons. It was death of a kind. This reverence for books was most touching. The joy of and transport in reading was beautifully captured. So was the companionship that books offer. Hanta said, \"I can be by myself because I'm never lonely, I'm simply alone, living in my heavily populated solitude, a harum-scarum of infinity and eternity, and Infinity and Eternity seem to take a liking to the likes of me.\" I get this and imagine many of my GR friends can identify with Hanta\u2019s experience too. The prose was gorgeous and I wanted to quote copiously the beautiful lines I read. There was humor too and I had many laughs (e.g., the episode with the mice in his cellar that shared his taste for fine literature).I felt tenderly toward Hanta who struck me as immensely lonely and in need of company beyond that afforded by the bales of books he read voraciously. One haunting scene was when he buried his uncle, scrapping up his remains bit by bit. I also respected him greatly for his love of books, his hard earned knowledge scrapped together literally from literature culled from the odious waste - what he termed being educated \"unwittingly\". I shared his distress when he could not stop whole libraries from being destroyed.The advent of the giant press meant the demise of small paper compacting jobs like Hanta's. A new generation of employees was ready to toss books into the recycling monsters with nary a thought for what would be lost.How would Hanta live when he no longer had a chance to rescue books from being pulped? The answer was the one I feared. This is my first book by my first Czech writer. What a grand small book! I cannot recommend it highly enough. .", "3,5*\u201cNow I\u2019m back at my press, making up wastepaper bales, a classical philosopher in the heart of each bale, and my body is relaxed by my morning stroll through Prague, my mind is cleared by the thought that I am not alone, that there are thousands like me in Prague working underground, in basements and cellars, and that they have live, living, life-giving thoughts running through their heads.\"Costumo evitar livros sobre livros, j\u00e1 que tendem a ser hist\u00f3rias bonitinhas e a\u00e7ucaradas, mas este pr3,5*\u201cNow I\u2019m back at my press, making up wastepaper bales, a classical philosopher in the heart of each bale, and my body is relaxed by my morning stroll through Prague, my mind is cleared by the thought that I am not alone, that there are thousands like me in Prague working underground, in basements and cellars, and that they have live, living, life-giving thoughts running through their heads.\"Costumo evitar livros sobre livros, j\u00e1 que tendem a ser hist\u00f3rias bonitinhas e a\u00e7ucaradas, mas este prendeu-me desde o in\u00edcio, com o retrato de um homem s\u00f3 e quase invis\u00edvel, prestes a ser soterrado por toneladas de livros e a ser ultrapassado pelo progresso.

Most probably what he thought the dim witted censors would do.This book is simply gorgeous. Hant\u2019a is the proverbial \u2018Idiot\u2019, compacting rare books for recycling, alone in a dingy cellar with his hydraulic press and, well: mice, flesh eating flies, rotten sewage and a keg of beer, perpetually sizzled and in vino veritas, thus enlightened. Over his thirty five year career, he rescues notable books and whilst acquiring an erratic self administered education, also hoards up stocks of them at home: to the point where his bathroom is chockers and there is only a smallish space left for him to squat over his toilet seat: one wrong move, and a ton of books will squash him like a fly as he\u2019s sitting doing his business.So far, one nil in favour of Hrabal, and against the reds. And yet. Why exactly is Hant\u2019a hoarding: well, so that, when he retires, he can buy a home hydraulic press and make his own recycled bales from them: the most beautiful bales in the world. Superficially, the score evens out now in favour of possible publication. Hant\u2019a is surely an idiot par excellance. And yet. Submerged deep in the belly of the narrative, Hant\u2019a innocently speculates that \u2018inquisitors burn books in vain. If a book has anything to say, it burns with a quiet laugh, because any book worth its salt points up and out of itself\u2019. And thus this deliberate, covert, slow dance of political thrust, parry and counter thrust continues, so that meaning is steeped within meaning like a Russian Matrioshka.Hrabal\u2019s language is beautiful, haunting, poetic: Hanta doesn\u2019t read, he pops a beautiful sentence in his mouth and sucks it like a fruit drop, or he sips it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in him like alcohol.The atmosphere is redolent of barely suppressed surrealism, allegory and folklorish overtones.

This sharp and eccentric short work is both devastatingly dark and obliquely humorous in the way it goes about its business of showing us the battle of one man's resistance to a totalitarian regime. There within features numerous quotes from classical literature and the great philosophers, whilst Hanta tries to make sense of identity and the perplexities of modern life. The narrative, which is at once touching and transcendent, also carries important political undertones and cutting criticism giving this slim book greater depth. If possible, best read in one go.

It was once, but my relationship with books has soured. Reading is, these days, like swallowing a cheap broth, one that contains the occasional scrap of meat, but which is, for the most part, thin, watery and bitter. Yet as a child I would avoid school and every day take myself to the local library. I would stand before the shelves in awe, almost afraid to touch, as I was so unused to things offering themselves to me. The rows seemed endless, unconquerable; and yet I perhaps now own more books than that library ever contained. I own so many; too many. But really they own me, and they oppress me. What was once my passion has become my prison. In my room I am surrounded on all sides by shaky towers of books. It is as though I am trying to wall myself in, when in fact I want to break out. I fantasise about giving them all away or creating a huge pyre and setting fire to it. Yet books, I\u2019m told, do not burn. So picking up Bohumil Hrabal\u2019s Too Loud a Solitude seems, at best, like a form of masochism. Not only is it a book, but it is a book about the value of books and the pleasures of reading. The value of books and the pleasure of reading? I am convinced that one day my towers will fall and crush me. They are crushing me already, slowly but surely. Too Loud A Solitude is narrated by Ha\u0148t\u2019a, a man who for thirty-five years has been compacting wastepaper, smearing himself with letters until, he says, he has come to resemble an encyclopaedia. As a character, he is the Hrabalian archetype, which is to say that he seems naive, perhaps at times even something of an idiot, but is, simultaneously, unassumingly, capable of great insight or displays of great intelligence. He is a man, a drunk you might say, who, for example, will sit dreaming at a bar and when he moves to open his wallet will fling upon the counter a mouse or let fall one from his trouser-leg. Yet he also quotes Nietzsche, Hegel, Rimbaud and Kant. Although lacking in formal education, Ha\u0148t\u2019a is well read, having received an \u2018unwitting education\u2019 from the books he saves from destruction, from the jaws of his press, and takes home. In this way, I am reminded again of that child, myself as a child, standing before the seemingly endless rows of books, timidly reaching out my hand. Where would I be without the activity that I now so disparage, which gave me my own unwitting education? At least Ha\u0148t\u2019a has the good grace to feel gratitude. He writes, lovingly, lovely lines about popping a sentence into his mouth and sucking it like a fruit drop, lines about thoughts that dissolve within him, infusing his brain and heart. Am I so bitter these days that I cannot acknowledge how beautiful that is? For Ha\u0148t\u2019a education allows, or gives birth to, thought; without access to profound ideas, one cannot have profound ideas of one\u2019s own; one\u2019s brain remains foetal. Yet, for me, education was a means of escape from a situation I found intolerable, from an environment that was harmful. My mother, bless her, cried at the station as I boarded the train that was taking me away to university. She cried, I\u2019m sure, because she understood that I had dug my way out, which is something she had once hoped for herself but never achieved; and books had been my tools, books it was that had broken the earth; without them I would have exhausted myself frantically clawing at the hard surface without making an impression. Ha\u0148t\u2019a, however, is much less demanding of life than I was. One does not get the impression that he has ambitions to be elevated above his current station; and yet books allow him to escape too. He is so good-natured that it would be easy to take lightly how heavy-hearted a man might feel deep in a mouse-infested cellar, compacting wastepaper, day in and day out, for thirty-five years; all while living in a police-state; a police-state that doesn\u2019t look too kindly upon books, to boot. It is no surprise, therefore, that he drinks; and it is no surprise that this underground man values, and takes pleasure in, the printed words that transport him to another, better world. Our world, Ha\u0148t\u2019a repeatedly informs us, is not humane; and he, furthermore, provides the reader with numerous examples of this inhumanity, such as the working girls who draw the insides from still living chickens and his gypsy lover who is murdered in a concentration camp. Yes, there is a cellar-deep strain of melancholy running through the book, although it is easy to miss it, to be seduced into missing it by the soothingly good-natured, and unassuming, voice of the narrator. Indeed, Too Loud a Solitude is a book of contrasts of this sort: Ha\u0148t\u2019a, the wise fool, the intellectual simpleton, who decorates his bails of wastepaper with art and rare books, like flowers in the barrels of guns; Ha\u0148t\u2019a, the \u2018refined butcher\u2019, the cultured artist and the destroyer of culture. Doesn\u2019t this topsy-turviness, this two-facedness, sum up human existence? The supreme and the inhumane, the good and the bad, love and hate, creation and destruction, suffering and joy, etc. Just look at Manka, poor Manka, the pretty girl who, when at her most divine, her most winning, twice falls foul of faeces. And Ha\u0148t\u2019a too, who takes pride in his work \u2013 which is itself a kind of shitting, what with paper going in one end and lumpy bails coming out the other \u2013 to such an extent that he wishes to purchase his press for his retirement; Ha\u0148t\u2019a, poor Ha\u0148t\u2019a, who falls foul, not of faeces, but progress, inhumane progress. Ah, how beautiful the world\u2019s hands are, but how dirty its fingernails. Bohumil Hrabal, as much as any writer, understood this; and I can\u2019t help but love him for it, even now. So I guess that this is a love story, in the end. Yet it is the worst kind of love, the kind that flickers with life, that occasionally reminds you of what you once had, that tricks you, for a short time, into thinking that you will have it again..", "I could not like this book.

Despite the moral contradiction that engulfs Ha\u0148\u0165a in his thirty five years of turning beloved literature into the wastepaper the state deems it is, he nevertheless retains a joyfulness (accompanied by a near-perpetual drunkenness), a private sense of creating art in the form of bales of 'waste' decorated with Gauguin and Van Gogh and consecrated by the words of beloved philosophers\u2014that is, until he is replaced by a bigger machine and faster union workers who drink milk and take holidays, who have been taught to work with a singleminded thoughtlessness that Ha\u0148\u0165a and his unwittingly educated brethren can not fathom. Yet, our narrator would rather be crushed by books than have his spirit crushed, thus bringing his story to its unforgettable coda. On many levels, Hrabal is Ha\u0148\u0165a, and Too Loud a Solitude becomes too a ballad to his own personal and literary resistance to the regime. However, even with the sheer courage of its publication set aside, it is both a book startlingly original and dazzlingly rooted in tradition: in the proverbial 'idiot' as the protagonist, we see a solitude whose composition is comparable to that of the characters created by Camus and Kafka (however, whereas absurdity in Kafka is achieved by putting one in an otherworldly setting, Hrabal's setting is no more absurd than the world he is living in or the way in which he relates to it). There is, too, a more obvious intertextuality in Ha\u0148\u0165a living with the proverbial (and then, not) ghosts of great writers and philosophers. What I found most arresting, however, is the sheer effortlessness and beauty with which the author here balances pathos and comedy, both slapstick and absurd\u2014I've never read anything quite like it, and it does not diminish the effect of the story but delivers it to an end quite the opposite.All in all, Too Loud a Solitude is a marvel too great to ignore and too haunting to forget.

Bohumil Hrabal uses a form of introspective narrative similar to Lispector, where reflexion and self-consciousness replace action. It is narrated in the first person which helps establishing a bond between the main character and the reader. Hrabal language is very expressive and beautiful and delightful descriptions are intercalated with grotesque and heinous portraits. The plot focuses on Ha\u0148\u0165a, a extravagant old man whose job is to crush paper in Prague. Although much of his work focuses on the destruction and obliteration of rare and banned books, Ha\u0148\u0165a is also a collector, and gains an encyclopedical knowledge from the books he gathers. This duality echoes throughout the book: the same person who destroys the books is the same person who saves them and worships them. This is a powerful statement by Hrabal that censorship will always fail to destroy ideas and books. That no matter how many books are destroyed some copy will always be kept immaculate, and thus the ideas that are meant to be obliterated will always prevail unscathed. Another idea that Hrabal uses is the doubt that Ha\u0148\u0165a has regarding his own opinions: are they his or were they transmitted by some book? Metaphorically this is represents the repercussions of propaganda and this form of gaslighting is a tool used by dictators.Ha\u0148\u0165a is an inhabitant of the underground. There he finds his comfort alongside with alcohol. Both these elements help establishing the idea that Ha\u0148\u0165a was an hermit. His dark, visceral demimonde is his place of comfort and alcoholic inebriation is his psychological comfort. Living like this, gives Ha\u0148\u0165a a particular view of the world. He is able to perceive what is obscure in the surface of Prague. There he is a spectator of wars between mice and rats. A perpetual war, that only ends before restarting. Even when his mother died, he found restfulness on the subsoil of the crematory, comparing it to his own workplace and further comparing his job of crushing books with cremation. The same way he uses his crushing machine to pay allegiance to the books he worships, the crematory allows his mother to ascend in the form of smoke to the skies. Ha\u0148\u0165a has a peculiar perception of the world being visited by a panoply of characters that Bohumil Hrabal uses to symbolize particular ideas. The main ones are: (1) Man\u010dinka - a former lover who becomes rejected twice by society, one time because during a dance she spit feces with her hair ties and later because she inadvertently she steps in a turd with her skies in a fancy skying resort, she is the allegory of Hrabal despise of Czech society back then; (2) The uncle - who worked in a railroad and bought a train after his retirement, the allegory of the work becoming the main identity under a dictatorship; (3) The gypsies - who regardless of status remained united in their shared ethnical condition; (4) Jesus and Lao-Ts\u00e9 - who appear as an alcoholic hallucination and materialize the duality of hope in the future (Jesus as \u201cprogressus ad futurum\u201d) and the return to the origins (Lao Ts\u00e9 as \u201cregressus ad originem\u201d).However, Ha\u0148\u0165a\u2019s job and identity are brought into questioning when new advanced paper crushers supplant his analogical one. This becomes a center piece of his depersonalization and ultimate catharsis, fulfilling his own fate..", "Bohumil Hrabal is a master with words.

I couldn't find a precise definition of the word, other than one who palavers, which is not helpful so I'll give it a go myself. A Palaverer is a literary, grammatical, and story acrobat. More specifically, a Palaverer writes extremely long sentences, sometimes as long as an entire book. They aren't just long for length's sake but also tell a story. Bohumil Hrabal's 'Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age' is one example of the craft. When one can perform such great acts on the high wire, walking on the ground is easy. That ease oozes through each sentence in Bohumil Hrabal's non-Palaverer novel, 'Too Loud a Solitude.' A small book with big ideas, 'Too Loud a Solitude' was written during a time when big ideas got one sent to the Gulag. Hrabal is Czech and wrote while the country labored behind the Iron Curtain. The Soviets banned his works until he publicly appeased the government in Moscow --to his supporters' ire.Too Loud a Solitude is an excellent introduction to the author. Hrabal's prose is evidence of his great acrobatic skill, though one is not reading a high-wire act, but rather a very grounded story, beautifully written, about a man toiling away in a basement. His conflict: he's tasked to destroy books and art but adores them above all else. Hrabal saddles this poor man with an additional problem: pride in his work. What's a man to do who prides himself on a job well done but whose job is to destroy the things he loves the most?

So I reThe Lasting Effects of Young Reading: A Short MemoirI first read The Glass Bead Game almost 60 years ago. It changed my life. With just the right cues of romance, high-tech adventure, philosophical mystery, and heroism, the book invaded my adolescent mind, laid down roots and suggested a long term plan: I would one day be able to play the Game. And I succeeded, at least during a goodly portion of my adult life, when I wasn\u2019t distracted by the trivialities of wealth, status, and religion. So I realised it was about time for me to revisit the ur-inspiration. A dangerous undertaking, I know, but perhaps the book could provide a sort of retrospective structure that I couldn\u2019t consciously recall. Worth the risk then.The epigraph alone rekindles the fire that smoulders still in my unconscious: Nothing is harder, yet nothing is more necessary, than to speak of certain things whose existence is neither demonstrable nor probable. The very fact that serious and conscientious men treat them as existing things brings them a step closer to existence and to the possibility of being born.I have experienced just this motivation with the force of compulsion. The task is both poetic and practical: to help people, particularly myself, to see what is hidden by what they already see, the things within and beyond what is apparently there. For a child of 13 or so, to have one\u2019s inarticulate intuition confirmed - that there is more to life than its surface - is profoundly important.I viewed the \u201cOrder\u201d and the fellowship of the game seriously and admired \u201c... the maximum integration of the individual into the hierarchy of the educators and scholars... \u201c My first attempt involved a Carmelite monastery. The next a military career. Followed by a time in professional academia and subsequently an international consulting firm which is best described as a professional Protestant monastery. All these, and most choices that followed, had the intention of assimilation into one form or another of an organisation of united and mutually supportive minds. The professional context didn\u2019t really matter. I had, it appears, a calling not dissimilar to that of the young Joseph Knecht, eventually the Magister Ludi, who had \u201cthe capacity for enthusiasm, subordination, reverence, worshipful service\u201d necessary to persist in The Game. Even today I find myself a member of a Dominican academic community which is the same size and similar in atmosphere to that of Knecht\u2019s school at Waldzell. Somewhat remarkably, I suppose, I have never been a joiner of clubs, or groups, or congregations, only those with some sort of monastic potential.Even the international firm to which I belonged, commercial as is was, had an ethos which could have been taken straight from The Game. It\u2019s senior partners were among the most powerful and influential business leaders in the country. Yet the head of the firm said to me proudly one day at lunch \u201cNobody knows my name.\u201d When he said this I immediately recalled Hesse\u2019s lines: \u201cThe hierarchic organization cherishes the ideal of anonymity, and comes very close to the realization of that ideal.\u201d Rarely did this assimilation ever feel oppressive or threatening to my individuality. As with The Game: \u201cFor us, a man is a hero and deserves special interest only if his nature and his education have rendered him able to let his individuality be almost perfectly absorbed in its hierarchic function without at the same time forfeiting the vigorous, fresh, admirable impetus which makes for the savor and worth of the individual.\u201d In order to make the point, I had the habit of submitting an undated resignation on the day I started any job. Even that felt like a ritual of integration. I exercised it myself by \u201cleaping,\u201d to use Joseph Knecht\u2019s term, whenever I felt The Game was being threatened.The idea of the rules of The Game, its language, and symbology undoubtedly provoked some sort of teen-age mysticism. But what most attracted me and still does is that The Game is \u201c... a mode of playing with the total contents and values of our culture...\u201d years later I would discover Wittgenstein and know that this is precisely what he must have meant in his term \u2018language games.\u2019 The downside from a career perspective, of course, is that narrow disciplinary constrains and professional mores became increasingly problematic. The world at large expects increasing specialisation with age. But for me intellectual maturity has always been a matter of expansion rather than refinement. This has made me less well-off than I might have been. But I am more than content. I also find that I retain some tendencies toward teen-age mysticism. Perhaps this is an accomplishment.It has been said that one is born either an Aristotelian or a Platonist. Empirically, it seems to me, there is some strength in this assertion. I am certainly in the camp of the latter and therefore fit right in to the Platonic bias of The Game, which Aristotelians would merely find just silly. It was Hesse who piqued my interest in philosophers like Nicholas of Cusa and Gottfried Leibniz. And through them into the idea of the ideal as a symbol of both purpose and the aesthetical. Unconsciously I suppose, I found myself associating with other Platonists and quasi-Platonists - West Churchman at Berkeley, Russell Ackoff and Tom Cowan at Penn, Oliver O\u2019Donovan at Oxford. Around each of these was a sort of invisible college, the members of which unknowingly participated in many rounds of The Game. That many of them are dead or no longer in my daily life is neither regrettable nor sad since the Order continues to unite us.Hesse\u2019s idea of the Age of the Feuilleton as a motivating social force for the development of The Game resonated in my young life with what I perceived as the random character of what people worried about - nuclear war, mortal sin, cures for acne - and what might actually matter. For Hesse, the daily newspaper was more about gossip than the factual information necessary for life. Hesse\u2019s narrator has only disdain for this age of wasted freedom:  Years later, I encountered William Gaddis\u2019s Recognitions and had a spark of remembrance about Hesse\u2019s witty critiques of celebrity and \u201cintellectual privateers\u201d, particularly among self-proclaimed artists, and most specifically writers. And many years still later, I am overwhelmed by Hesse\u2019s prescience in anticipating the evil of unintelligent internet social media. Perhaps they will be exactly the catalyst necessary for the real creation of The Game!Mathematics and Music are the core disciplines of The Game. I can blame Hesse for implanting this as a seed in my psyche. It legitimised for me my interest in numbers (but certainly not the techniques of calculation insisted upon by my teachers) and classical music (of which none of my contemporaries had the slightest interest). Once again, it is unclear whether The Game provoked or merely articulated these interests. Ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter because The Game is my personal symbol for both. Recently while reading Edward Rothstein\u2019s Emblems of Mind (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), a book which critiques music in terms of mathematical aesthetics and vice versa, I had very clear flashbacks of my pleasant surprise at being able to adopt Hesse\u2019s discovery as my own. I have occasionally abandoned either mathematics or music as one might lose one\u2019s childhood religion. But they have always returned as the matrix of my own version of The Game.I could go on ad nauseam recounting the many other specific influences that The Glass Bead Game has had on my life. But this short reflection is enough to show me the profound depths to which we can be influenced by what we consume as literature in early life. I don\u2019t know what lessons this might entail. Perhaps the reflection is only productive as a sort of therapy that makes conscious what has been hidden for decades from will and choice. Hesse suggests this might be his intent in the text where he describes The Game evolving as \u201ca form of concentrated self-awareness for intellectuals.\u201c Having said that, there is nothing I would change about allowing The Game into my life..", "There\u2019s a scene in Antonio Tabucchi\u2019s Indian Nocturne in which the narrator meets an Indian intellectual who asks him, among other things, what he thinks of Hermann Hesse.

The narrator, resenting the interruption and perhaps with a sense he is being mocked, heaps scorn on the German \u201cspiritualist\u201d, calling him sentimental and likening him to a sweet liqueur, and only later realises he hasn\u2019t said what he thought of Hesse at all. In some way, these days, I suspect there\u2019s a little of this narrator in many of us. Hesse \u2013 unlike Kafka or Beckett or Mann \u2013 is not an intellectual\u2019s badge of honour. Frequently, I\u2019ve approached one or another of his books again after a hiatus half-expecting that this time I will have grown out of him, but I never do. The Journey to the East has enthralled me since I first read it in my teens \u2013 and probably I understand only marginally more of it now than I did then. The \u201cTreatise on the Steppenwolf\u201d (unlike much of the rest of that most famous of his novels) I likewise revere. The early novella Knulp is a small masterpiece, touching and true. Demian has its moments, Siddhartha too (though again its fame is out of proportion to its content), and Klingsor\u2019s Last Summer and many of the short stories and even Narziss and Goldmund if you\u2019re on a roll and don\u2019t want to stop. But looming over all of them, dwarfing them and pulling together most of what\u2019s best in each of them is The Glass Bead Game, a book which, despite myself, and though I doubt I\u2019ll be able to convey why without reading it again (a fourth time), I count among the five or so most transformative reading experiences in my lifetime. Like The Journey... or \u201cThe Treatise...\u201d, the \u201cGeneral Introduction [to the Glass Bead Game] for the Layman\u201d is Hesse at his finest \u2013 not so dissimilar to Borges in his essayistic tone and otherworldly humour, and throwing out mindbending concepts with casual aplomb. The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing with the total contents and values of our culture; it plays with them as, say, in the great age of the arts a painter might have played with the colours on his palette. All the insights, noble thoughts, and works of art that the human race has produced in its creative eras, all that subsequent periods of scholarly study have reduced to concepts and converted into intellectual property \u2013 on all this immense body of intellectual values the Glass Bead Game player plays like the organist on an organ. In other words, an early glimpse of post-modernity, but telescoped into an imaginary future (after what Hesse dryly characterises as \u201cThe Age of the Feuilleton\u201d) in which \u2013 for the purposes of players of the Glass Bead Game \u2013 artistic production has stopped or gone underground, and the highest cultural calling is to manipulate what has been left behind by former ages, to create \u2013 in a hyper-ritualised setting and for the benefit of worldwide audiences \u2013 these \u201cgames\u201d that are part music, part mathematics, and use a futuristic brand of calligraphic characters to sample and integrate their component parts into a quasi-equation that can later be studied and reproduced. At the centre of this enterprise, the Magister Ludi \u2013 or master of the Glass Bead Game \u2013 is treated like a priest or deity by devotees of the game. But there is none of the rock- or movie-star \u201ccult of personality\u201d about these figures; not only are their identities kept secret except from a few close initiates, but their study in biographies or histories is discouraged. Certainly, what nowadays we understand by personality is something quite different from what the biographers and historians of earlier times meant by it. For them, [...] the essence of a personality seems to have been deviance, abnormality, uniqueness, in fact all too often the pathological. We moderns, on the other hand, do not even speak of major personalities until we encounter men who have gone beyond all original and idiosyncratic qualities to achieve the greatest possible integration into the generality, the greatest possible service to the suprapersonal.Nevertheless, The Glass Bead Game is, for the most part, a biography of one earnest if somewhat rebellious Magister, Joseph Knecht \u2013 a man whose early brilliance followed by his ultimate resignation is a touchstone for all who question the value of life behind the cloistered walls of Castalia, the \u201cpedagogical province\u201d in which his story takes place. What do we have here then, if not the old, \u201cpathology\u201d-based form of a biography? A kind of everyman story, the story of a type. But Hesse\u2019s type \u2013 and I think this is beautiful in light of the leader of his former homeland when he wrote this \u2013 is a leader, the ideal leader, and the culmination of a search which runs throughout Hesse\u2019s work. Joseph Knecht is a kind of holy man, but with none of the pomp or self-importance which, maybe, these days, that implies. \u201cKnecht\u201d in German means \u201cservant\u201d, and throughout his short life Knecht impresses us as just that, a servant both to those he governs and to some other voice \u2013 or \u201ccalling\u201d \u2013 which comes to him from beyond. Like all of Hesse\u2019s characters, Knecht exists to \u201cfind himself\u201d, but unlike Harry Haller or Knulp or Emil Sinclair or even Siddhartha, he does not despair (at least not in these pages); like Leo, the leader-in-disguise of the Journeyers to the East, he remains tranquil and alert to his duties. Throughout the book Knecht\u2019s own writings are quoted, and at the end of the \u201cIntroduction...\u201d, in speaking of classical music, he writes the following:[...] always there may be heard in these works a defiance, a death-defying intrepidity, a gallantry, and a note of superhuman laughter, of immortal gay serenity. Let that same note also sound in our Glass Bead Games, and in our whole lives, acts, and sufferings.Earlier Knecht\u2019s biographer had warned us:The poets told horrific fables about the forbidden, diabolic, heaven-offending keys, [...] the \u201cmusic of decline\u201d; no sooner were these wicked notes struck in the palace than the sky darkened, the walls trembled and collapsed, and kingdom and sovereign went to their doom.People fault Hesse for what they see as his sentimentality. Sometimes, I can see their point (as in the relationship of Harry Haller to his young prostitute friend in Steppenwolf, for example). But when he manages to rise above all the doubts and complaints of that lonely wolf of the steppes, there is actually something quietly heroic in Hesse\u2019s stance. In Switzerland, in 1943, along with his friends Paul Klee and Hugo Ball of the Cabaret Voltaire, this man refuses absolutely to play the \u201cheaven-offending keys\u201d. Whatever he creates will partake only of that \u201csuperhuman laughter\u201d and \u201cdeath-defying intrepidity\u201d, no matter what horrors his homeland can spew forth (and, as his writings on the war show, Hesse was far from ignorant of these). And so, on the surface, his may seem a fantasy for which the modern (or post-modern) world has little use: escapism, idealism, even (amid the destruction of Europe by guns and explosives) lyricism. But read more closely and it\u2019s evident that the despairing, human Hesse is passionately present in almost every word of this. Yes, the characters in The Glass Bead Game \u2013 like Beckett\u2019s characters, like Kafka\u2019s \u2013 can seem more or less than human. No, there is no sexuality in their world (nor in Waiting For Godot, for that matter), and as if to foreground this lack Hesse writes his \u201cIntroduction...\u201d entirely from a genderless \u201cwe\u201d standpoint, which while not spelling it out seems to suggest (or has always suggested to me, anyway) that we are to treat these characters as beyond or outside of the ordinary realm of the sexual. (Why? Perhaps because, to a German in Europe in 1943, sexuality did not seem that crucial a topic.) Me, I\u2019ve never demanded \u201crealism\u201d from fiction; in fact, I like writers who alert me to the fact that the beings they create are not human. Likewise, I don\u2019t care in the least that the end section of the book \u2013 \u201cJoseph Knecht\u2019s Posthumous Writings\u201d \u2013 is probably just a series of sketches done in warm-up for the task of creating Knecht. To me, at least one of these novellas (\u201cThe Father Confessor\u201d) is easily among the best of Hesse\u2019s works in its own right and never fails to have me in tears by the end of it. And even the poetry (poorly-suited to translation as it is) is illuminating in showing the genesis of the conception.If I haven\u2019t said much about the substance of Knecht\u2019s story, the truth is I don\u2019t remember much of it, but for snatches of scenery (which Hesse describes so well) and a general feeling of the excitement of a young man following his calling. If you read for plot, this isn\u2019t the book for you. But if you want to hear the wisdom of a wise, possibly heartbroken man determined, despite everything, not to hit the jarring notes of the diabolic keys but to sing with the laughing voice of an angel, this is it. I don\u2019t care if that sounds sentimental. The world needs artists who are willing to speak calmly from the storm, and Hermann Hesse was one of them. I take my hat off to you, Herr Hesse. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your guidance..", "The Glass Bead Game is a profound and complex contemplation on the relation between reality and art.

On attaining the great skill in music, spirituality and meditation, Joseph decides to devote himself to the art of the Glass Bead Game.

His highest goal seems to have been reached but he feels that he is surrounded with futility, his existence is full of vacuum, he wants to share his tremendous knowledge with others and to be useful.Game and discipline of the mind through meditation had become the truly characteristic values of Castalia\u2026To Knecht, therefore, this meant one more tie, one more counterpoise to his growing urge to renounce everything and achieve a breakthrough into a new and different sphere of life. Nevertheless, this urge developed inexorably.

I realize I\u2019m at odds with the world in judging this book harshly, and I realize there may yet be some dimension of brilliance here that I\u2019m just not seeing, but grant me this, it\u2019s not for lack of trying. No other novel have I ever laid down without a backward glance within a few dozen pages of the end, certain at last that the great payoff for my eight hundred pages of patience was never going to come. Here\u2019s the big plot spoiler: nothing at all happens in this book. Not \u201cnothing\u201d in a loaded, John Cage way, just nothing, as when the author cannot deliver on his heady promises but publishes a book anyhow. I actually think it\u2019s kind of important to call bullshit on all the approbation the book receives.The two fundamental failures in the book are its main character and its central device, the Game itself. Both failures are drearily total, and each is all the more of a letdown for the breathless, never-ending clamor of hype both within and without the book\u2019s pages.The book starts right out with the declaration of Joseph Knecht\u2019s pivotal importance, as the greatest player the Game has ever had, after whose career the history of the Game could never be the same. This is repeated ceaselessly throughout, in narrative asides. Meanwhile, we watch a pleasant, unassuming, talented young boy as he is handpicked by a professor, becomes a promising student whose great potential is remarked on by everyone he meets, and moves on to become a professor at a young age. He is indeed the youngest ever to become Magister Ludi, so at least that should earn him a mention in the history books. We are told, I think precisely once, that when he runs a game, it\u2019s a good one. And then he gets old; along the way he meets some people and has some conversations. And then he dies in a swimming accident, and then we riffle through some of his personal papers until the book is over. Even his youthful writings, a strange little coda to his own life story, echo the pattern of fervent affirmation of the importance of a character\u2014plainly himself in thin disguise, but now being described, just as fawningly, in his own voice\u2014who goes on to do nothing much.If in fact Knecht ever does anything of greater historical importance than being generally agreeable and good at what he does, it is not told to us. His life is a dull blank, undeserving of a biography at all, especially when at least three other characters go by who might actually have made good reading. Consider the strangely beatified Music Master, whose unexpectedly mystical transcendence of humanity Knecht merely witnesses when it comes along late in the book; that might be worthy of history. Or Knecht\u2019s boyhood rival, a fiery young student who leaves the academic world and is reunited with Knecht later on one of the protagonist\u2019s vanishingly rare ventures outside his ivory tower; his relationship to the Game is complex and troubled, but this barely ruffles the surface of Knecht\u2019s complacency. Or there is the Sinophile who draws Knecht into a dialogue with Chinese history and literature, who gets to deliver the book\u2019s most interesting challenge: when Knecht seeks his assistance in bringing the symbology of the I Ching into the vocabulary of the Game (much easier, you\u2019d think, than it would have been to encapsulate French poetry or organic chemistry, since the I Ching is already encoded in a set of symbols easily printed on beads), his new mentor smiles and says you can build a garden in the world, but good luck fitting the entire world inside your garden. What\u2019s this? A character within the Glass Bead Game dismissing the Game itself as far lesser than some other symbol system? Here, now, we have the potential for a meaty examination of this Game thing, which we deserve after putting up with so much talk about it. But Knecht just shrugs and goes about his business, and there will be no exposition upon either system. Because the Game is the other aching nullity at the heart of the book; there\u2019s nothing there.Hesse was inspired to write, beyond doubt, by the legitimately awesome notion of the Game. He imagines a symbol system within which all academic disciplines can be encoded, and can interact with each other, like a conversion chart for all fields of knowledge. Within this system, all concepts are encoded on beads, and it seems any of them can meaningfully combine with any other, such that wild new ideas emerge in the interplay. Here is the complex discourse wherein some kind of game, some competition or contest, can flourish, a game of all human learning, ranging like lightning from one discipline to another, referencing everything. Only a rarefied kind of academic could hope to understand such a game, let alone play it competitively. And the book is set within the cloistered academy where these super-scholars are trained.It\u2019s a sweeping, fascinating idea. It\u2019s enough, without adding much of anything else, to drive a really memorable short story. But Hesse wanted it to crown a towering edifice, worthy of the sense of weight and magnitude that was, in fact, only the subject of the idea rather than its dimensions. By which I mean: it was a vague little slip of an idea about something vast and weighty, rather than actually being a vast and weighty idea. But Hesse fooled himself, and in his excitement he determined to write a very long novel, and that was a mistake from which there could be no recovery. The fatal problem is that Hesse wilts instantly before the task of filling in any kind of detail about what the game was and how it worked. He hasn\u2019t a clue. Inspired by his book, several people have gone on to design more or less playable games to match their impressions of the game he only alludes to\u2014you can find them on the internet if you look around\u2014but he never does. And the more ambient suspense the author generates by promising a brilliant reality, without ever showing even a flickering corner of it, the worse the bland filler starts to smell when it all gets stale. Mind you, I know it\u2019s too much to ask for him to generate a practical game that lives up to his vision. But we don\u2019t need him to do that. He need only sketch some part of it, fill in a detail here and a detail there that his characters can make part of their workaday conversations. He does need to do something, though, and it needs to pass muster as at least a tantalizing beginning of the thing itself. One example, perhaps, of a specific bead that represents something from the science of biology; what is written or drawn on the bead? What might be one instance of that bead\u2019s being played in answer to a bead representing some architectural concept? That would be enough. He makes frequent mention of music\u2014indeed the deification of music, common among writers, is so relentless here as to become a minor problem in its own right\u2014but no sign of how it relates to any other field. Of course, a writer needs to be able to let the reader fill in empty spaces that the story only sketches with spare gestures. But the gestures need to be the beginning of something worthy.In the event, that one game\u2014\u201dcomposed\u201d by Knecht during his tenure as Top Official in Gameland\u2014gives us just enough detail to make clear, after most of the book has gone by, that what\u2019s actually happening here is a solo show. Knecht has composed a complex exercise in advance, and now the other players are just acting it out, perhaps filling in some details at their own discretion but abiding by a predetermined structure. Our one glimpse of the practical nature of the game has all the fanfare of a whoopee cushion. The Game isn\u2019t actually a game. Nobody's playing. There are no objectives. It\u2019s some sort of abstruse, very quiet performance art.A long book full of portentious self-promotion but with nothing to say. An elaborately wrapped present with no gift inside. A big fat nothing. Not the nothing of the Buddhist, who longs for nothing and seeks it, but that of the Wizard of Oz\u2014a nothing that noisily proclaims itself to be everything..", "\u201cNo permanence is ours; we are a waveThat flows to fit whatever form it finds\u201d \u2015 Hermann Hesse, The Glass Bead GameI remember reading Hesse's Siddhartha and Narcissus and Goldmund right out of high school.

There was something both disquieting and uniquely calming about these strange little books that Hesse wrote detailing his love and fascination with Eastern thought and philosophy. I figured this year I would read the Glass Bead Game (and later Steppenwolf). It is in many ways Hesse's subtle answer to the growing Fascism in his country. But, at its heart, it isn't an anti-Fascist book. He is aiming for more. He is thinking bigger.It is a book about harmony and the arts. The exploration of how music, mathematics, intellectualism and life can become transcendent and beautiful. The Glass Bead Game is a mysterious fill-in that allows it to be at once none and all of man's endeavors. It is a holy raga, a tactile masbaha, a literary syncretism, that captures the whole of man's achievements and is practiced by an elite few. Using the framework of the Game Hesse is able to look at the dynamic of all of man's achievements as being both beautiful, worthwhile, but also frivolous and fleeting. He looks at the tension between those who remove themselves from mankind's experiences with those who live IN the world. There is a pull and a reciprocity between these two groups. He is looking for those things that balance those groups and ultimately those things that cause these groups to separate.The book also explores the (mostly) Eastern ideas of meditation, surrender, loss and renewal. I found these ideas (obviously) beautiful and rewarding, but I'm still not sure if I really liked the structure of the book: Part 1 (pages 7-44): Introduction to GBG; Part 2 (Pages 45-427): Magister Ludi's story; Part 3 (428-445): Magister Ludi's poems; Part 4 (446-558): The Three Lives (other incarnations of Magister Ludi). I'm just not sure if the structure worked for me. It did well enough, but I loved and hated it too. Maybe that was Hesse's intention. The first part was a parody of those 'history of the saints' that appear so often and so frequently in all religious traditions. It was interesting, but just didn't mix well with the final parts of the novel. I did like having Knecht's (re)incarnations be outside of time. While Magister Ludi was set in the future, the other incarnations of Magister Ludi were more likely from the past. An interesting construct, but the weight of the last was too little for the heavy front. But these are frivolous issues. For the most part, I liked the book. It is incredible that in the face of WWII and Nazi Germany Hesse could write this. History and the inevitable burning push of evil must have seemed dark and heavy, but ultimately this book (written from 1931 to 1943) contains the germs of peace and tranquility. I think that peace comes from the idea of a spiritual retreat (a common theme) and surrender. Hesse wasn't saying to run from Evil, although he did himself leave Nazi Germany. But I think his book was communicating the ability to find peace through surrendering to one's own situation and place in the universe. The Glass Bead Game one day will disappear, but so too ONE DAY will fascism and evil, because all of man's creation is a game. So, surrender to the game and surrender to the universe..", "I like Herman Hesse. I like Siddhartha, I remember liking Steppenwolf, I like huge sagas that probe the mind.

I was about fifty percent through the book, bored out of my mind, and I started reading reviews trying to get some motivation to finish this tome. I didn\u2019t find ANY. First of all, everyone that gave it lots of stars either didn\u2019t write a review, or wrote a review that\u2019s literally a re-writing of the synopisis from Wikipedia. I\u2019m not trying to insinuate that they didn\u2019t really read it, or that they didn\u2019t really understand it, or even that they are trying to seem cool by giving a Nobel winning book a good star rating--- I\u2019m not insinuating that, but I have to wonder. I didn\u2019t hardly find a single review that actually illuminated what that person actually enjoyed about the book. Most reviews were along the lines of \u201cThis story follows the life of Josef Knecht, who rose to become the youngest Master Ludi.\u201d Or \u201cThis book talks about elitism, intellectualism, and touches on Buddhism.\u201dOk? But what did any of you THINK about that? I mean, I know WHAT the book is about, I want to know if you enjoyed the presentation of those arguments, the story, did you agree or disagree?There was nothing about that. So, at 50% through, I stopped reading. I have a rule, I usually give a book 100 pages to grab me, if it\u2019s a long book I\u2019ll give it 200. I gave this book more than a fair shake, I even looked for reasons to keep going, but I don\u2019t think there are any.There is nothing in this book, that wasn\u2019t a total rehash of every other book that Hesse wrote. So, here is my opinion- this is a dull drab affair in which nothing happens. I feel that there were some really interesting things that COULD have happened, or hell, even a treatise just on the ideals of the Glass Bead Game itself would\u2019ve been more interesting. I love the idea that the GBG is a synthesis of the knowledge and culture of mankind throughout history. The Glass Bead Game is a design that is supposed to move this story forward, that is supposed to be the gravitational pull at the center of the book that all the words orbit around. Instead it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s nearly so forceful; it\u2019s shrouded in mystery, but not the interesting-leaves-you-wondering-days-after-the-book kind, it\u2019s the oh-you-couldn\u2019t-be-bothered-to-actually-figure-it-out kind. That leaves Josef as the driving force of the book, but the only time he comes to life is when the actually interesting side-characters come back into the book, like the Master of Music. Josef is just a receptacle for the intervention of the other characters. So basically this book is like 800 pages of reading about someone with the personality of a garbage can and about some marbles that aren\u2019t ever really described to you. Good luck. And, if you honestly DID, enjoy it, for the love of god tell me why, without summarizing the book. If I hear a good enough argument I\u2019ll go back and finish it, but at this point, I have no faith that it gets any better, and I cannot force myself into it.Read Hesse\u2019s other books, they are much more enjoyable. If you want something to touch your soul read Siddhartha..", "Second IntroductionI saw that a Goodreader commented on another review that they felt this was a book for young people, which caught my attention with a jolt because I had barely finished thinking that this was plainly a book written by an old man.

Which it was. These are in no way contradictory notions, they even sit together as one of the themes of the book: \"meaningful and meaningless cycle of master and pupil, this courtship of wisdom by youth, of youth by wisdom, this endless, oscillating game was the symbol of Castalia\" (p207) First IntroductionSince I have had a second introduction it follows that I ought to really have a first one. So here it is.Because we have a game in the title and playing this game is of some significance in the novel then that might be a place to start. Another review mentioned the possibility that the game was a form of pure mathematics, while reading it occurred to me that it was a way of talking about fiction. A game the reader and author play by themselves and that the author plays with the reader, not all games are equally amusing as one notices. That led to the conclusion that the game was another game - a McGuffin. A thing that serves to get Cary Grant from New York to the middle of a wheat field so somebody can try to machine gun him from an aeroplane because somebody else thought it might look good on celluloid. We simply have to accept it has no greater meaning than to be intrinsically meaningful to the characters even if no machine guns are involved (view spoiler)[ they are not, nor aeroplanes, but there is a car (hide spoiler)]. Or as one of the characters in one of the embedded stories might say \"illusion, illusion!\" paragraph about playfulnessWe're kind of warned from early on that this is going to be a playful kind of book. The author presents himself merely as the ever so humble editor of a biography written in the future of a fictional person. Then we get an introduction from the 'actual author' who denies the possibly of biography and tells us that we won't tell us about the game before telling us about the game, and who in passing mentions the absence of various sources, before leaping into the story in which the purported author seems to have omniscient knowledge of the imaginary subject of the story. Finally we get some poems and short stories which we understand have been written by the subject of this biography and which thematically stand in some relation to the main text. so, did I fall off my chair laughing ?No.Although I did laugh and once cry while reading the second of the short stories which is my favourite part of the whole book, apart from the ending of the main part of the text. Further I noted that since the books on their shelf were fairly well compressed that some the pages had a fraternal desire to stay together, and significantly, that I wasn't much troubled by this. should I read this book ?I don't much like shoulds, maybe you have read it, maybe you will read it, maybe you won't. To misquote Voltaire - when a rat on one of his Majesty's grain ships dies on the way from Egypt to Constantinople is the Sultan much troubled?I'm not sure when I first read this book, or why. Rereading I found it uncompelling, but also I had the strong suspicion that I had absorbed a fair amount of the book into myself as thirsty soil sucks in water the first time round, and that I had creatively misremembered bits of it, specifically the second of the short stories which in grossly modified form I had told as a rambling anecdote on several occasions (view spoiler)[ as you can imagine I am not in great demand as an after dinner speaker (hide spoiler)]. Perhaps this is no more than to say I was not in the right state of mind to have read this novel at this time, but reading this novel may well prompt or encourage such a way of thinking about the world(view spoiler)[ Confused? (hide spoiler)]. Third introduction, necessitated by the aboveJust as Sancho Panza taught that thee is a relationship between the story and the manner in which it is told so we might assume there is a relationship between how you start and how or indeed if you get to finish a tale. One of the themes in this novel is world history, the relationship between a plant and the soil it grows in. Ba! Maybe I first read this book when I was a student. When I was a student, I had no grey hairs, and also it seemed to me that people repeated the image of the ivory tower when talking about universities and the studious life, or maybe I was just more attuned to that kind of speech as the time, to my amusement as I wandered (view spoiler)[ and wondered, which may have been while some of them didn't last particularly long (hide spoiler)]through a variety of jobs and joblessness it struck me that each one was itself an ivory tower with its own God (not always Mammon) hierarchies and Priesthoods, sacred assumptions, peculiar idiocies, and character, admittedly one could regard professions like accountancy and the law as bridges between these towers, providing some helpful common concepts like illegality and bankruptcy, but these too were worlds of their own, journeying between worlds, as occasionally one has to, is like being an astronaut  I come in peace! Take me to your leader! Come, be welcome, drink of our corporate tea or coffee, accept one of our cheap biscuits as symbol of our contempt! Whoops I'm lost in reminiscences again. Anyway, from a certain perspective the entire landscape is covered in ivory towers (view spoiler)[ which explains why elephants are so rare these days (hide spoiler)].What I was going to say, before I interrupted myself, was that this novel was finished in 1943 and imagines an ideal Utopian society, naturally the other side of a utopian society is a dystopian one. And a place that calls itself Castalia, brings to mind Castile, the land of castles, and one has to wonder quite what do they want to lock themselves up away from? What threatens them, why are they so defensive? Indeed reading \"Our Castilia is not supposed to be merely an elite; it ought above all to be a hierarchy, a structure in which every brick derives its meaning only from its place in the whole. There is no path leading out of this whole, & one who climbs higher & is assigned to greater & greater tasks does not acquire more freedom, only more & more responsibilities.\" (p81) I could imagine O'Brien from 1984 saying much the same kind of thing to one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9es - but then one of the themes of this book is the reconciliation and interrelationship of apparently contradictory elements!What I was going to say, before I interrupted myself, was that this novel is a German novel written in what might have been a German century. It is a kind of alternative for Germany, a continuation of Thomas Mann's vaunted unpoliticism at times when politics was pretty unavoidable. Empire, Socialism, War, Cultural upheaval, Fascism, More war (view spoiler)[ it strikes me that in a profound way Hesses'a achievement is charting a personal course that didn't sail through militarism, anti-Semitism and the far right, but then read in the context of this novel his life would be a necessary counterpoint to the dominant Zeitgeist (view spoiler)[ and for all I know he might have been nasty to the people who loved him, and stole sweets from small children  (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]. So what do you do, such was part of the soil that Hesse grew in, he knew Theodore Heuss who had been a follower of Max Weber (view spoiler)[ and this is a book about men and male relationships, fraternal, as well as master and apprentice (hide spoiler)] Hesse had been close to C.G.Jung, so there is psychology, the iChing, alchemy, God, spiritual growth (view spoiler)[ but no skirt chasing (hide spoiler)]. Both Weber and Jung deeply interested in \"the east\" as offering ways out of the steel cage of the sonderweg of the development of \"the west\" so this novel features yoga and meditation as well as everything else, Reincarnation might be a theme too. Hesse's utopia is an alternative Germany, federalism has led to a purely academic federal state, probably in the south-west and apparently subsidised by the rest of the Union. The novel plays with the relationships between the master and the apprentice, the teacher and the taught, the seduction or corruption of the young by the old as well as the reconciliation or alignment of apparently opposite elements. An old Imperialist may well have written that 'East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet'. Hesse is a bit more sensible and admits that once you have east, then you have to have west, and perhaps north and south too, that these things are separate, distinct and an inseparable whole all at the same time and that such a scheme can be carried across to analogous situations, which possibly can be represented in a Game which despite being the title of the book, is never explicitly described. The principal character experiences his Castalia directly, then formally has to address himself to it and argue for it consciously as a utopia, then has to experience it as dystopia, then has to go forth and inherit the earth:\"The two tendencies or antipodes of his life, its Yin and Yang, were the conservative tendency towards loyalty, towards unstinting service of the hierarchy on the one hand, and on the other hand the tendency towards 'awakening', towards advancing, towards apprehending reality\" (p257). The short stories in which the main character might be imagining other versions of himself, might be arguing that the reconciliation of opposites or the conflicting tugs we experience in life may not be resolvable in one life, but if one could or does live many lives then perhaps on average, they might even out, but one might need a certain set of skills to appreciate that in any one life in particular. Writing and reading novels might be one of those skills.This exists on the great, sprawling family tree of books, reading I felt there was something I thought that I could mention in a review with regards to Tolstoy, but I can't remember what, the dialogue in the second of the two short stories reminded me, particularly in the childlike nature of much sin, of the Grand Inquisitor in  The Brothers Karamazov - another novel that the author claims he didn't write with a supposedly limited narrator who has apparently omniscient knowledge. Conclusion (view spoiler)[ because if you introduce something then one has to conclude it too (hide spoiler)] But as I said, I didn't fall off my chair laughing.Notes from reading(view spoiler)[a war time novel. is the glass bead game a way of talking about writing the mid-20th century novel? incidentally, my respects to your Magister Ludi.

In some ways as brilliantly written and erudite as this book is, it felt quaint to me. It portrays a fictional country in some vague future where the primary concerns are intellectual matters. The types of subjects that I discussed while getting my Master\u2019s degree in English Literature. In essence, The Glass Bead Game is like being in an ahistorical, intellectual grad school program studying The Glass Bead Game. And despite the fact that (view spoiler)[the main character in the end rejects this world for the world of history and the struggles of humanity,  (hide spoiler)] the greatest majority of the book lives in this intellectual realm. And yet here we live right now in the age of the brute. If literature is to matter it must somehow relate to the core struggles of our age and in that this book misses the mark. Those we struggle against right now are the rich barbarians who pursue ever greater wealth and power. We do not struggle with convincing society\u2019s intellectuals to engage more with humanity. These intellectuals are relatively irrelevant right now. We struggle with political movements, the media, and power. Who is Hesse writing to convince? The professor of comparative literature or philosophy? Is that his audience? In a nutshell, reading The Glass Bead Game felt like fiddling while Rome burns. The Glass Bead Game is primarily a fictional biography. The story of the life of a great intellectual scholar, named Joseph Knecht (sounds like \u201cconnect\u201d as EM Forrester wrote, \u201cOnly connect\u201d), who was a master, teacher and overseer of a game that is called The Glass Bead Game. This game seems to be a bit like\u2026intellectual tennis. A slow, live debate that crosses media from music to linguistics to math and other apolitical studies. The debate is so slow paced that competitors meditate between responses. We never actually see an example game, but it does sounds incredibly tedious and boring. It\u2019s the kind of debate that Monty Python would have mercilessly mocked as they did with skits such as the Philosopher\u2019s World Cup game (Plato is in goal, don\u2019t you know?) and The Philosophers\u2019 Song (I drink therefore I am!). Admittedly, at times, the excessive details of these theoretical intellectuals playing intellectual games became borderline comedic. There were subtle touches of satire in The Glass Bead Game, but the overwhelming story was just so full of these obsessive intellectual thought processes that I found the actual content overwhelmed what may have been a satirical intent. The debates are definitively and intentionally disconnected from history. Notably, Knecht lives for several years in a Catholic monastery, and the abbot of the monastery, who becomes his friend, challenges him on this disconnection from history. Accusing the scholars essentially of living in an abstract inhuman world. Disconnected and unengaged from what really matters.I found it interesting to note that even when Hesse speaks about the abstract intellectual versus the dirty human realm of politics, he generally references the personal characteristics of leaders and needs of communities or countries vying for power. In this realm he has invented, Hesse has completely obliterated political systems. That is to say, ideologies and systems such as Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, Anarchism. Even while acknowledging the ahistorical nature of Knecht\u2019s commonwealth (positioned as being \u201cpost war,\u201d), Hesse has presented the story itself in a strange political vacuum. Trump would not be our President without the promotion of Fox News and other right wing online media outfits. These forces are generally ignored in this story of the intellect versus the body, the life of the mind versus the life of politics.The Glass Bead Game in a way seems to be about \u201cconnection\u201d (Knecht) as a theme, and how the game connects across categories and media. But further, this game is also related to the fantasy of the Renaissance man\u2026that famed personality from the Renaissance who was able to learn everything that has ever been learned about all of the sciences and literature, was well read in every subject, and could speak on any topic extemporaneously. This fantastical creature is now dismissed today as unimaginable because each of the disciplines is so deep that it would take a lifetime to delve into any single topic and still only scratch the surface. Hence all the graduate level departments across the country. But what I actually want to call attention to in this premise is not the fantasy of this conceit, but rather the use of the word \u201cman\u201d in this phrase. There was never a \u201cRenaissance Woman.\u201d And similarly, in The Glass Bead Game, it really began to bother me at about the halfway point that all of these intellectual scholars were male, and that in Hesse\u2019s fantasy, women were not permitted in this exclusive elite world. Women are repeatedly positioned in the story as temptations. They are objects that pull men from their higher aspirations. In general, I found the overall context to be a disappointingly male-dominant perspective. One might call it anti-feminist or at a minimum, Hesse presents a patriarchal system. Marriage is portrayed as the man marrying the woman. The students are generally desexualized, their situation being not unlike a seminary or a monks\u2019 retreat, and there is no mention of homosexuality or any sexual acts. Despite this criticism there is one very powerful social critique that occurs about three-fourths of the way through the book. When Knecht is considering leaving the scholarly order to pursue engagement with the greater world of humanity, he writes in a letter on the subject of political power (which is rarely referenced in the story because politics is not supposed to intrude into this abstract scholarly world). But here he pointedly and with foresight illuminates our current moment in time. He notes how propaganda is the death of truth and that this results when a political power seeks to assert domination. In just a few short paragraphs, it\u2019s as if he predicates the book 1984 and Donald Trump and the Republican party. Hesse (or Knecht) speaks to the pursuit of truth (which we might think of as meaningful journalism) and how when men fail to pursue truth, they become diabolical (Fox News). Despite my overall distaste for the book, Hesse has his brilliant, insightful and powerful moments.One aspect of this story that links The Glass Bead Game to Siddhartha, Hesse\u2019s great work that occurs during the time of the Buddha\u2019s life, is the presence of meditation. Meditation is something that the masters of this scholarly world are trained to participate in every day. It is intended as a way to both soothe and calm their anxieties and to keep them productive. In relationship to The Glass Bead Game itself, it\u2019s used as a tool to help them develop insight before responding. It reminded me of the tension between Zen Buddhist meditation, which I participated in frequently when I was a member of a Zen temple, and how meditation is encouraged simply as a stress release tool by hipster Silicon Valley startups. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that in my opinion, and in fact it\u2019s encouraged as a method for stress relief even by many respected Buddhist teachers. And regardless of intention, when properly applied, meditation can be an accidental back door to enlightenment. Meditation is worth doing in and of itself without any ideology associated with it yet because it is a practice it can lead to personal intimate experiences. In The Glass Bead Game, we see it primarily as a tool that is almost the opposite of the way Buddha would suggest it. The scholarly masters describe it as a way to submit your individuality to the hierarchy. Whereas Buddha would say there is no hierarchy.I will conclude my review by touching on my own experience with graduate school. I loved English Literature as an undergrad. We read great books and discussed them as if they were meaningful. Weighing what the author was trying to say and what the story was trying to communicate. When I was in graduate school, 99% of my time was spent instead on analyzing critical theory. We were theory analysts rather than literary analysts. It was a snake eating its own tail. An incestuous world of meaningless jargon. Not only was Knecht trapped in this scholarly abstraction, but I felt that too much of The Glass Bead Game kept me, as a reader, trapped in this abstract intellectual realm. My escape couldn\u2019t come too soon..", "I feel that I must open this review by stating that I am an unabashed fanboy of Hermann Hesse. I read everything that he had ever written at a whirlwind pace several years ago and still return to my favorites, Steppenwolf, Siddhartha and Demian, on a rotating yearly basis. That said, I have often heard that The Glass Bead Game is the magnum opus of Hesse's career. The purest expression of the themes that he had highlighted in his other works. If one were to read only one book by Hesse it should I feel that I must open this review by stating that I am an unabashed fanboy of Hermann Hesse.

That said, I have often heard that The Glass Bead Game is the magnum opus of Hesse's career. The purest expression of the themes that he had highlighted in his other works. If one were to read only one book by Hesse it should be this one, I had been told. No offense to those earnest recommendations, but I could have gone a long time without reading this dull retread of every one of Hesse's other books.So many of the same character types and situations appear in these pages that I can't help but feel I'm reading a Cliff's Notes version of his oeuvre. The strangely passionate yet platonic love affair of minds between an elder scholar and an impetuous youth a la Narcissus & Goldmund? Check. The intense friendship between two geniuses; one sheltered and naive, the other worldly and brash like those in Demian? They're here too. A Westernized attempt to understand the mysticism and philosophical underpinnings of Eastern religions a la Siddhartha and Journey to the East? Oh yes, they too are here.This repetition in itself does not make The Glass Bead Game unappealing. Stretching these themes over some 400+ pages in Hesse's typically dense prose does. This isn't a bad book and might actually be a good one. But coming into it expecting something unique would be a mistake. This has all been written before, and far more engagingly..", "This, his final novel makes it clear that all his works need to be read in their order as one edition leading up to his final life conclusion!

One ground and distilled from a life of thought. But the voice wavers at times as the story foretold has a waver of its own.Joseph Knecht is selected as a student of promise. As his achievements are recognized, much to his surprise and glee, he is selected to the highest consecration of the intellectually elite, Castalia. Supported by the government those enrolled or encumbered in Castalia have in some way sworn to dedicate themselves to maintaining its well ordered hierarchy. The hierarchy supplies Castalia with serenity, a static but comfortable stability, built to prevent any disordered flow of disruptive emotion while dedicated to a life of contemplation, research, study of any subject worthy of intellectual exploration.Is there any other of us who earlier in life didn\u2019t wonder, can\u2019t I just get paid for thinking? Reading? Come on, there must be somebody else. Do I see a hand raised?Joseph Knecht enjoyed learning for learnings sake. Due to this, his steadfastness, lack of any ambition where it came to a rise in status, was hauled upwards into the higher brackets of the hierarchy where his tasks were no longer oriented around his passionate love for teaching, teaching especially the young. As he left his friends behind in the world when he left for Castalia he now left his beloved profession. Of course he dedicated himself to his new duties, gradually rising to a position so lofty it can barely be discerned by the outside world, in its abstract ether; Magister Ludi. The Magister (Master) of the Glass Beads Game. The holy trinity exalted into blends of knowledge, philosophical thought, aesthetic creation, their intertwining, interweaving into the multitude of countless interstices. The games as drawn up in competition are archived. Abundant and frequently referred to, they are held with reverence. The Glass Bead games not only singles out the best players but insures the continous enlargement of consciousness, wisdom, knowledge. The world wonders, as the intellectual elite of Castalia expects, what good is pure intellectual pursuit for the sake of pure intellectual pursuit? Castlia is repulsed by the sordid life of the working class with their lack of curiosity, non-questioning obeisance to the trifles of meaningless conventions and dully repeated jokes; their ant-like drive to follow whoever is in front of them in the long endless moving line to avoid any flint of individuality lurking around dark corners in danger of being lit.Castalia readily points out, in the current twenty third century, it was properly born from the previous years of conflict and destruction evolving into a means of avoiding such an occurrence. Indeed there has not been.Knecht himself isn\u2019t positive what the connection is or if there is one. He and his colleagues, in their monk-like quasi religious life, having sacrificed any iota left of individuality to the order, preserving the knowledge of what to do and how to behave in all circumstances, the comfort of effacing stability, also follow what they are told. However, with the stamp of elite buried in their brow they are held and hold themselves in a higher status.Do they contribute except for responses to papers written and studies summarized within their hallowed halls? The resounding answer within these halls is, of course we do. The pure pursuit of truth is always elevated to the highest. Besides, dealing with life in the world is a lower pursuit and one not worthy of following. Understanding that the world and its production enables Castalia to exist, does not alter their view. The world with its bustling jobs based on fear and ambition thinks the same of Castalia.And where is Knecht?Hesse\u2019s skill as a novelist is shown in his ability to dramatize this rather than lecturing. The dramatization is furthered by attention to detail and the apt planting of narrative seeds barely recognized at first, then the enjoyment of its first lucid buds and flowerings thereafter.Ha! The more I write the more there is to be said in this glass bead game of my own that I have created and fallen into. Let it be said this was Hesse\u2019s last novel and its ending is immense. It was an honor to be in The Glass Beads Game presence, in the presence of Hesse..", "This is surely one of the most beautiful dreams depicted in literature.

It is also a reminder that even the most beautiful dreams cannot feed our longing, which is ultimately for a reconciliation with the Real. The Glass Bead Game is an allegory of the relationship between symbol and reality, between life and the magic lantern of the mind.Hesse's Castalia is a utopia of mind, which is born of and supported at great expense by a society recently ravaged by a terrible war. It is an enclosed place in which this society has deposited for safe-keeping all the greatest values of the spirit in a hermetically-sealed harmony immune from the ravages of worldly change. Isolation from life is intended to safeguard Castalia's status as a radiant Ark that can secure the continued existence of these supreme values of human life, transporting them unharmed and untainted across the darkness of historic flux.\u201cEach of us is merely one human being, merely an experiment, a way station. But each of us should be on the way toward perfection, should be striving to reach the center, not the periphery.\u201d In Castalia's network of serene alleys, one finds a perfect reflection of the garden of symbols that is one's own mind. The goal of Castalia is to give concrete expression to the unity of the mind in all its manifold manifestations. Every province of the mind finds its concrete expression here, from the arts, to mathematics, to the contemplative disciplines, to the most recondite special sciences. One can feel fully at home in this environment. A cross between a Platonic academy and a Zen monastery, this is a place in which the entire structure of the mind finds its fullest expression by being concretized in actual institutions. Life here is placed entirely in the service of the mind. Here, life exists merely to fuel the progressive unfolding of mind's capacity for the ever-progressing elaboration of existence into form. The consummation of life, and Castalia's ultimate goal, is a supreme formalism that can encompass the essence of life, thereby containing it in a supreme super-structure. This formalism is expressed in the Glass Bead Game. It realizes Leibniz's dream of a universal language (or characteristica universalis), which, he thought, once attained, would bring us to the consummation of the philosophical quest: a universal science. The goal of the Game is to lead us to the great Terminus of all seeking, a universal system \"capable of reproducing inthe Game the entire intellectual content of the universe.\u201d \u201cThese rules, the sign language and grammar of the Game, constitute a kind of highly developed secret language drawing upon several sciences and arts, but especially mathematics and music (and/or musicology), and capable of expressing and establishing interrelationships between the content and conclusions of nearly all scholarly disciplines. The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing with the total contents and values of our culture; it plays with them as, say, in the great age of the arts a painter might have played with the colours on his palette.\u201d Imagine having a universal language that can express the manifold content of all provinces of knowledge and experience according to a single unifying logic. This would make Chomsky's dream of a universal grammar pale in comparison. The Glass Bead Game is a language that can reduce to a single logico-grammatical plane a motif from classical Indian music and a mathematical formula, the structure of the future perfect tense and the biological structure of a rhizome, a cosmogonic myth and a logical proof. Hesse puts before us this dream of dreams, the possession of a language of thought that would give us the symbolic tools with which we could at last compare every possible datum of human experience, so that we could see what the myth and the logical proof can say to each other, and how the structure of a leaf is like a symphony and like a mathematical model. It is like Babel undone, the reduction of all universes of discourse to one meta-discourse, offering us a genuine basis for the comparison of all meanings accessible to the mind. The closest philosophic vision to Hesse's Castalia that I can think of is Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms, which similarly seeks to express the unity of human knowledge into a single philosophical language. It is, by the way, significant that music and meditation have such a prominent place in this scheme. Musical form reflects the Romantic side of cognitive form, and reflects Goethe's contribution:\u201cPerfect music has its cause. It arises from equilibrium. Equilibrium arises from righteousness, and righteousness arises from the meaning of the cosmos. Therefore one can speak about music only with a man who has perceived the meaning of the cosmos.\u201d Music reflects the level of a more immediate engagement with the world than does either mathematical or logical form. Hesse's universal language manages to bring even the seemingly formless domain of music into dialogue with the most formal of disciplines, like mathematics, and to reveal their relations as parts of a larger systematic whole. Music has to do with establishing a relationship with the world characterized by equilibrium. Music expresses the unity in difference that characterizes the realized mind. In this symbolic universe, Hesse tells us, music comes closest to disclosing the form of the real. And the emphasis on meditation expresses Hesse's effort to reconcile East and West, Plato and Buddha. He seems to have struggled his entire life to form a philosophical outlook that placed these two cultural traditions in dialogue, such that each could comment on the significance of the other. Meditation is the ground of intellection in his Castalia; it unlocks the true meaning of cognitive form. In this, Hesse shows a remarkable understanding of the nature of form: only through a meditative act can scholars here fully reveal the content of symbolic forms:\u201ceverything actually was all-meaningful, that every symbol and combination of symbols led not hither and yon, not to single examples, experiments, and proofs, but into the center, the mystery and innermost heart of the world, into primal knowledge. Every transition from major to minor in a sonata, every transformation of a myth or a religious cult, every classical or artistic formulation was, I realized in that flashing moment, if seen with a truly meditative mind, nothing but a direct route into the interior of the cosmic mystery, where in the alternation between inhaling and exhaling, between heaven and earth, between Yin and Yang, holiness is forever being created.\u201d Everything is all-meaningful, everything can be interpreted. This is a language that can express the entirety of our capacity for deriving meaning out of experience, and does so in such a way as to lead us to the central mystery: our \u201cprimal knowledge,\u201d our latent and unrealized awareness of the \u201cinnermost heart of the world.\u201dThe one thing that in this luminous structure remains a bit of an outlier is, significantly, history. History is hard to integrate into this shimmering edifice of Castlian symbolic-play because it consistently gestures beyond this serene, unperturbed province to the larger, dark continent of life that it is part of. It keeps pointing to the connection between the two, and to Castalia's paradoxical need for that messy, trouble, war-torn world. It is significant that the work was conceived in the nightmarish period leading up to, and culminating in, World War 2 (the first attempt at publication being 1943). This is more than historical coincidence; Hesse's narrative continually gestures to this historic background, and to a fundamental escapist motive, as the source of Castalia. It turns out that this lotus could only bloom from the dark flux of historic muck. The horror of the war is, ironically, an integral part of the significance of the beautiful Game of symbols. Historical awareness is what ultimately awakens Knecht's ethical consciousness, sending him to turn his back on Castalia and return to the world to serve it. Through this sacrificial renunciation of his calling, Knecht the servant resembles Nietzsche's Zarathustra and the Buddha, both of whom had to leave the clear beauty of the heights in order to return to the uncaring world in order to offer it their unwanted service. His ultimate sacrifice for his one pupil at the end shows the last word of wisdom: wordless sacrifice in the service of life's inscrutable progress.  For a long time I have puzzled over Hesse's choice to conclude this novel with three fictional autobiographies written by Knecht in his school days. They symbolize Knecht's attempt to project himself into different historical periods, to really enter into the life of mind as it transpired in other times. One can see the pedagogical point: until we, too, do the same, we do not understand ourselves. History holds the key to our story. It is by transporting ourselves into other times that we can really discern where we are, the shape of our horizons, through an act of comparison. But why these three lives... After ten years, I still don't have an answer. The most moving, to me, was the first, which is Knecht's attempt to transport himself into the mind of the earliest humans, as a rain maker. The rain maker represents the wisdom of primary, pre-symbolic (or minimally-symbolized and differentiated) experience. For him, there was no differentiation between self and world, nature and soul. Reality was perfectly contained in the totality of experience. \u201cEverything was reality, was steeped in reality, full of it as bread dough is of yeast.\u201d He represents the experiential ground of the unity of the whole edifice of mind:\u201cHe read the veinings of a leaf, the pattern on a mushroom cap, and divined mysteries, relations, futures, possibilities: the magic of symbols, the foreshadowing of numbers and writing, the reduction of infinitudes and multiplicities to simplicity, to system, to concept. For all these ways of comprehending the world through the mind no doubt lay within him, nameless, unnamed, but not inconceivable, not beyond the bounds of presentiment, still in the germ, but essential to his nature, part of him, growing organically within him. And if we were to go still further back beyond this Rainmaker and his time which to us seems so early and primitive, if we were to go several thousand years further back into the past, wherever we found man we would still find - this is our firm belief - the mind of man, that mind which has no beginning and always has contained everything that it later produces.\u201d But the unity of the mind runs deeper still:\u201c...the Master and the boy followed each other as if drawn along the wires of some mechanism, until soon it could no longer be discerned which was coming and which going, which following and which leading, the old or the young man. Now it seemed to be the young man who showed honour and obedience to the old man, to authority and dignity; now again it was apparently the old man who was required to follow, serve, worship the figure of youth, of beginning, of mirth. And as he watched this at once senseless and significant dream circle, the dreamer felt alternately identical with the old man and the boy, now revering and now revered, now leading, now obeying; and in the course of these pendulum shifts there came a moment in which he was both, was simultaneously Master and small pupil; or rather he stood above both, was the instigator, conceiver, operator, and onlooker of the cycle, this futile spinning race between age and youth.\u201d This passage expresses, I think, the essence of the Upanishads, the intuition of the supreme identity of Atman, the deepest locus of unity, the source and goal of wisdom. The relationship between the boy and the master, their cyclical change of roles, and their ultimate identity, is Atman. Such recurring passages throughout the work give glimpses into a level of insight that is of no use to Castalian inquiry. They suggest that from the very beginnings of culture, this primal ground of insight was available to us, and that it remains with us unaltered even in the highly sophisticated intellectual culture of Castalia. This order of insight connects us to the deepest past and to the remotest future, being something no education can give (though it can perhaps take it away). Hesse, having learned from Eastern philosophy, is very sensitive to all the domains of wisdom that cannot possibly receive symbolic representation, even in the perfect formalism, the meta-language of the Game. What is the point of telling the story about the labyrinth of mind? For many years, I thought Knecht's leaving Castalia was anticlimactic. I couldn't get why he would leave, expecting, as he did, so little from the world. He had the promise of making his life a perfect unity in that reclusive world. He left that meaning and unity behind in order to commit himself to the dark flux of the world, and, in the end, to be destroyed by it. It seems his leaving is a jarring break in the unity of the work. We cannot follow him where he goes, or discern any meaning to his ultimate sacrifice. But now I think that IS Hesse's point: this is Hesse's movement from a purely theoretical, to a moral existence. And moral action often shows no overt consummation; often the sacrifice seems to have no discernible point. Perhaps it is with this meaningless act that Knecht finally grasped \u201cthe meaning.\u201d \u201cTo stiffen into stone, to persevere!We long forever for the right to stay.But all that stays with us is fear,And we shall never rest upon our way.\u201d.", "The Glass Bead Game (1943) is the ultimate work of Hermann Hesse, who took nearly ten years to complete.

And this organ has attained an almost unimaginable perfection; its manuals and pedals range over the entire intellectual cosmos; its stops are almost beyond number. Theoretically this instrument is capable of reproducing in the Game the entire intellectual content of the universe.\"Our story is primarily written from the perspective of 25th-century historians looking back at an undefined past period and chronicling the life of our main character, Joseph Knecht. His life takes place many years after major wars ravaged Europe. These events slowly led to the development of a fictional province, Castalia, separated from the world around it, reserved for a monk-like but secular community of scholars whose primary goal is to live the life of the mind without much regard for politics, economics, or technological advancement. Central to this motivation and their order is the preservation and synthesis of all arts, sciences, & humanities. To pursue this, they have systematically incorporated many fields of study into a single discipline and medium of expression that forms the core of their order and aesthetic worship, The Glass Bead Game. This novel starts off with an introduction to the origins and development of The Game. Like many artifacts of mankind, the foundations of The Game have been shaped by the particular historical trajectory of the zeitgeist & cultural womb that birthed it. A significant section of the novel is devoted to critiquing a prior period called The Age of Feuilleton (from which we might agree that this represents a critique of our culture in Hesse's time). This era was marked by an incredible degree of intellectual freedom and unfettered growth of what we might call a culture of opinions, trends, and disconnected hyper-specialized trivia, an \"era emphatically bourgeois\" and superficial information consumption. From Hesse:\"We must confess that we cannot provide an unequivocal definition of those products from which the age takes its name, the feuilletons. They seem to have formed an uncommonly popular section of the daily newspapers, were produced by the millions, and were a major source of mental pabulum for the reader in want of culture. They reported on, or rather \"chatted\" about, a thousand-and-one items of knowledge.\"\"A torrent of zealous scribbling poured out over every ephemeral incident, and in quality, assortment, and phraseology all this material bore the mark of mass goods rapidly and irresponsibly turned out.\"The historians of the future further comment on their surprise at not only how people seemed to devour this chit-chat for their daily reading, but actually thought it was what constituted the standard educational diet of a good citizen, with all that mattered was to link a well-known name to a current topic of interest. Perhaps more surprisingly, this was not only limited to a critique of the average person on the streets, but also the large number of intellectuals that helped produce content for this machine, as well as those younger people and supposed educated class where entertaining or impassioned lectures were consumed and distilled into one or two catchwords with an accompanying picture (memes anyone?) based on works they'll probably never read. Hesse explains: \"The life of the mind in the Age of the Feuilleton might be compared to a degenerate plant which was squandering its strength in excessive vegetative growth, and the subsequent corrections to pruning the plant back to the roots. The young people...attending a university and taking a nibble of this or that from the dainties offered by celebrated and loquacious professors who without authority offered them the crumbs of what had once been higher education.\"Furthermore, this critique by future historians seems to take on an almost moralistic angle of spiritual corruption in that these people were engaging in all of this in hopes of serving as a temporary salve to their existential dread, spasmodically moving through life with no real belief in a tomorrow. And after a combination of destructive wars and the above, it is here where Hesse's future historians explain the cultural turn towards creating the secular (but still religious in its very uniquely aesthetic way), Castalian Order. An order that cultivates a drive for deep knowledge that cuts across arbitrary disciplinary lines and hints at something more fundamental, lasting, and greater than the empty and dry, fact-based husk of the previous culture, a cultivation of personal meaning and the sense of one's place in the grand arc of the universe. A very Platonistic weaving of ethics, beauty, and truth. In fact, it's interesting to note that Castalia references the mythological Greek naiad-nymph who transformed herself into a fountain at Delphi. And that drinking from the waters of her fountain was not only a rite among the contestants in the Pythian Games where fitness, music, poetry, and painting were celebrated, but also a sacred part of the Delphic Oracles who gave prophecies in the form of poetic dactylic hexameters, all of which seem to hold sacred some sort of pursuit of Truth. At a very superficial level, this combination of pious monastic-life, knowledge curation, and artistic expression reminds me of other works of fiction like Anathem by Stephenson, or A Canticle for Leibowitz by Miller, and delightful aesthetic vibes with the animated film The Secret of Kells. And the slightly magical bildungsroman element certainly reminds me of the young protagonist in Le Guin's children fantasy novel, A Wizard of Earthsea, growing up and learning the secrets of the Language that governs the world and how ultimately he must seek his own spiritual balance within it.Like most people, the almost mystical descriptions of The Glass Bead Game are what initially drew me into the book. Hesse explains how the development of The Game grew from a combination of this previous moral bankruptcy and isolated communities of knowledge, and how some dreamed of a new universal language of communication, cutting across all the sciences, humanities, and arts. Here we can see real-life parallels to both C.P. Snow's famous work, The Two Cultures, where he decries the split between the sciences and the humanities and the consequent detriment to society, in addition to Gottfried Leibniz's Characteristica Universalis, in which he sought to represent all forms of knowledge in common symbolism, to which one could eventually calculate on and resolve all disputes with his Calculus Ratiocinator. From Hesse:\"Some dreamed of a new alphabet, a new language of symbols through which they could formulate and exchange their new intellectual experiences\u2026Such a language...should be able to express the most complex matters graphically, without excluding individual imagination and inventiveness, in such a way as to be understandable to all the scholars of the world\"The historians go on to describe the humble origins of The Game:\"...the pupils at the Cologne Seminary had a rather elaborate game they used to play. One would call out, in the standardized abbreviations of their science, motifs or initial bars of classical compositions, whereupon the other had to respond with the continuation of the piece, or better still with a higher or lower voice, a contrasting theme, and so forth. It was an exercise in memory and improvisation quite similar to the sort of thing probably in vogue among ardent pupils of counterpoint in the days of Sch\u00fctz, Pachelbel, and Bach\u2014although it would then not have been done in theoretical formulas, but in practice on the cembalo, lute, or flute, or with the voice.\"And that this one musician in particular, \"...was adept at playing the violin in the old way, forgotten since 1800, with a high-arched bow and hand-regulated tension of the bow hairs. Given these interests, it was perhaps only natural that he should have constructed a frame, modeled on a child\u2019s abacus, a frame with several dozen wires on which could be strung glass beads of various sizes, shapes, and colors. The wires corresponded to the lines of the musical staff, the beads to the time-values of the notes, and so on. In this way he could represent with beads musical quotations or invented themes, could alter, transpose, and develop them, change them and set them in counterpoint to one another. In technical terms this was a mere plaything, but the pupils liked it...For a time the game of musical exercises was played in this charmingly primitive manner. And as is so often the case, an enduring and significant institution received its name from a passing and incidental circumstance. For what later evolved out of that students\u2019 sport and Perrot\u2019s bead-strung wires bears to this day the name by which it became popularly known, The Glass Bead Game.\"From here we witness its popularity shifting from music students to mathematicians, bringing the game a high degree of flexibility and possibility. Once this was achieved we begin to see players showing up from various disciplines and casting their own field into the language of the mathemusical game, eventually abstracting the physical glass beads into a symbolic, calligraphic language of icons, incorporating linguistics and classical philology, astronomy and physics, architecture, the visual arts, and so on, such that one can start from a particular musical piece, connect it with a psychological analysis of poetry from a particular historical figure, and then use the underlying patterns to predict the motion of the stars. Because of its pursuit of an underlying singular Truth to all things and multiplicities within itself, more pious thinkers began to associate it with an achievement of perfection, pure being, and fullness of reality, and \"[t]hus, 'realizing' was a favorite expression among the players\", beginning to incorporate practices of absolute absorption and meditation into the game, such that it was less like a competitive game in the traditional sense of the term, and more like a playful exercise of personal reflection. This last part calls to mind a particular perspective in mathematics known as Game Semantics where we can re-interpret things like mathematical proofs (and by the Curry-Howard Isomorphism programs too) as a game resembling a Socratic dialogue or exchange of information.This connection between the pursuit of Truth with the expression of Beauty clearly has Pythagorean and Platonistic influences, especially with the whole melding of mathematics and music. And despite opposition by certain philosophers and scientists that generally fall under Korzybski's 'The Map is not the Territory', the significance of these 'Beauty=Truth=Good' ideas have echoed and reverberated many times throughout history, taking the form of Voltaire's Candide, Kepler's Harmonices Mundi, Occam's Razor / Law of Parsimony of 'simplicity is best', and numerous instantiations of the general Variational Principle throughout physics. From the Castalian monks: \"With us scholarship, which is the cult of truth, is chiefly allied also with the cult of the beautiful, and also with the practice of spiritual refreshment by meditation.\"And because of this, these same real-life disputes between the Aristotelians vs. Platonists, the Empiricists vs. Rationalists, and even the famous paper by Wigner on The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences arise on whether The Glass Bead Game can really capture all of reality or is it just pure navel-gazing insular introspection of a language talking about itself. You can see this philosophical disagreement being played out between Knecht's mentors:  \"Once Knecht confessed to his teacher that he wished to learn enough to be able to incorporate the system of I Ching into the Glass Bead Game. Elder Brother laughed. \u2018Go ahead and try,\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018You\u2019ll see how it turns out. Anyone can create a pretty little bamboo garden in the world. But I doubt that the gardener would succeed in incorporating the world in his bamboo grove.'\"versus \"Should we be mindful of dreams?\" Joseph asked. \"Can we interpret them?\"The Master looked into his eyes and said tersely: \"We should be mindful of everything, for we can interpret everything.\"With all that said, there are many more ideas this novel touches upon. The culture of ivory tower academia and whether it stands apart from or is embedded within society, the nature of mentorship, the value of neurodiversity and the dance between seemingly contradictory philosophies, the extinguishing of the self as one becomes subsumed within a hierarchy, and many other topics.Lastly, if you are like me and enjoy thematically pairing up your fictional reads with concurrent non-fictional material for a richer experience, I read this book alongside Rothstein's Emblems of the Mind + Tymoczko's A Geometry of Music. Another decent book would be Mazzola's The Topos of Music. Mazzola has an excellent article of his own discussing The Glass Bead Game and its connections to Category Theoretic ideas (moving beads along string diagrams anyone?), and whose theories are also addressed by the same Tymoczko above. Small world! CONCLUSIONI'm honestly wondering why I haven't come across this book much sooner, since this simply resonates with my soul. I immediately fell in love with it from just the first 30 or so pages, and it's now ranked as one of my all-time favorite books. Special thanks to my friends Max Krieger + Prathyush from this charming interdisciplinary Discord group based on the \"the aesthetics of formal things\" for calling my attention to this.So why the 9/10 rating? I expect most readers will find the cadence tedious, with the slow and non-action-based plot leading to an abrupt ending, followed by poems, and then concluding with 3 short stories. I personally would've chosen a meta-artistic route mirroring the book's themes, incorporating the poems + short stories within the bulk of the book rather than appending them to the end, similar in style to my all-time favorite book, G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach by Hofstadter, or maybe even Cloud Atlas by Mitchell. I would then tastefully & playfully incorporate some classical music\ud83c\udfb6, calligraphy\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f, poetry\ud83d\udcda, I Ching symbolism\ud83e\udd62, and mathematics\u2744\ufe0f throughout the novel. I think something like this would have made Hesse's novel feel more cohesive and integrated in delicious logical-poetic knots of self-reference, very similar to a Glass Bead Game composition being played out, allowing Hesse's novel to paint nuanced emotional strokes to artistic depths :)\"In the psychological Game...the object was to create unity and harmony, cosmic roundedness and perfection, not so much in the choice, arrangement, interweaving, association, and contrast of the contents as in the meditation which followed every stage of the Game.\u201cThe Game as I conceive it...encompasses the player after the completion of meditation as the surface of a sphere encompasses its center, and leaves him with the feeling that he has extracted from the universe of accident and confusion a totally symmetrical and harmonious cosmos, and absorbed it into himself.\".", "My review is based not on the book itself, as it was read it so long ago, I don't remember details, which is somewhat remarkable, as I remember the effect of the book. transformative, profound revelationary, this is the best I can manage.

According to my foreword by Ziolkowski, this book represents a progression beyond both the simplistic, egocentric spiritualism of Siddhartha and the Nietzschean misanthropy of Steppenwolf. He also remarks on the book's form: a narration by a stodgy academic about the life of a luminary master. Like Carlsyle's 'Sartor Resartus', there is meant to be an ironic disconnect in what the narrator fails to recognize about the sublime reality of the situation, though Hesse doesn't descend into open absurdism like Teufelsdroeckh's tale.While Carlsyle is unpredictable and madcap, Hesse's narrative is low-key and repetitive. Much of this can be blamed on Hesse's dull narrator, though I was never sure how much. I spent most of the book trying in vain to discern what was meant to be serious philosophy and what was a sly rejection of Hesse's earlier beliefs.The most somber, sacred moments of Hesse's attempt to build a 'Secular Spirituality' often struck me as the least convincing. For example, the more glowingly he described the persona of a secular 'Saint', the more I felt he was describing the effects of a rather serious case of Alzheimer's.Each time he mentioned either the 'sense of peace' or 'childlike smile', they began to seem more sinister. He returned to them again and again, insistently, the sole signs of the character's wisdom, until I couldn't help but mistrust them.It would certainly be a biting satire on the Old Eastern Master who speaks few words, since those he does speak rarely seem to make sense. Usually the student blames their own ignorance, but if the old master is just doddering? The idea is a very cynical one, and quite amusing. Yet it is hard to reconcile this deep satire with the general tone of the work.Hesse doesn't build his ideas from the ground up, at least not that I could see. Much seemed to be assumed. Yet neither was there the revelatory, overawing voice of the poet-philosopher to nudge us from dry narrative to sudden insight. It felt like Lovecraft's old trick of describing how a horrible sight affected a character instead of describing the horror, itself.But it wouldn't do for me to go on any more about cynicism, insightful satire, and poet-philosophers without invoking Nietzsche. He plays a role in the text, literally: the protagonist's unstable, brilliant friend is a caricature of the influential philosopher, and perhaps unsurprisingly, I found his inclusion the most appealing part of the book.It was not merely the presentation of his philosophies, but the way Hesse spoke of him. The passages which describe him are some of the most evocative and heart-felt in the book, which is curious, because he is presented as quite flawed and muddled in thought, though still brilliant.Even when the protagonist scorns him or undermines his rhetoric, Hesse seems unable to truly overcome the force of Nietzsche. He praises his ability to pluck out one part of an argument, a single idea or thought, and with care and insight, cause you to realize for the first time how remarkable it is, or how foolish.Sadly, Hesse himself lacks this great ability, making his critiques less grand than his subject. Yet this, too, seems almost deliberate on Hesse's part.At one point, the protagonist listens as the Nietzsche stand-in goes on a rant about the pointlessness of history. This is representative of the general opinion of Hesse's utopian/dystopian vision of a kind of secular, academic spiritual society which has, to the protagonist's sorrow, lost touch with the world.But to put it in this character's mouth seems hardy appropriate. Certainly, there was a redefinition of the fluidity of history and of the people who made it up in the Hegelian tradition, but it was hardly the insular rejection of humanity put forth here. Nietzsche steeped himself in history, old masters, old thinkers, and ideas, such as the Dyonisian vs. Appolonian philosophies. Perhaps the character was simply convenient, though it undermines the work's own historical attempt to pit real philosophical ideas one against the other. Perhaps this was just another symptom of the detrimental effect Heidegger and Nietzsche's sister have had on how he is viewed today.After shaking his head in silent scorn for his friend's wordy speech, our protagonist goes on to give a similar speech, himself, at the end of the same chapter, about raising of a world of thoughts and ideas above the ugliness of the humanity; the speech even seems to ape in form and style his friend's earlier thoughts.Again, I felt unsure of Hesse's message. Either he again ridicules what he once might have praised, or fails to clearly present his philosophy, or is quibbling between two ways of leaving mankind behind for the sake of ideals without pointing out to us what is meant to separate them.Again I side with Nietzsche's stand-in, and I think, not merely because I am Nietzsche's man, but because I cannot find the point where Hesse has presented his side of the argument as anything except a farce.Likewise the ending of the book seems to make pointless satire of the 'Sacred Transgressive Event' of the hero, which I could appreciate, but if that is the case, then it certainly puts the rest of the book in an odd light.It is not difficult to read it as one of the most dry, sombre, heartfelt, absurdist tracts in literature, but the writings of the most fervent believers cannot always be easily be separated from the satires of the most clever cynics.Three short works complete the book, each a fiction-within-a-fiction attributed to our protagonist. Yet these, too, could either be the budding spirituality of a noble man, or signs of conceit from an ultimate fool.I found the early parts of the book painful to read, not merely because of the dullness of our narrator or the confusion I felt in trying to untangle Hesse's philosophies, but because it is, at it's core, the story of a fairly smart guy who is given everything on a silver platter by a series of wise men who recognize how special he is.It's not merely that this left us without much conflict, it was annoying reading about someone effortlessly achieving things that sound like they would be cool to do. There followed a brief, interesting period of conflicting political machinations, but that soon faded, leaving us with our protagonist's thoughts and inner turmoil.Or, rather, it left us with our narrator's apparent invention of those thoughts. Some of the book is presented as source material--speeches, letters--but most of it seems to be whatever Mr. Frame Story felt was going on at the time.This creates another layer of distance and complexity which compounds the difficulty of any attempt to figure out what, if anything, Hesse is getting at. The narrator constantly seems to think he knows exactly what all the characters were thinking at any point in time, down to their fears, childhood aspirations, and goals for the future. Either Hesse is taking vast liberties with the setup, or this guy is one of the most unreliable narrators we could be blessed with.So, I'm not really sure what Hesse's philosophy is, or even what the character's philosophies were, though I could say something about the narrator's. The whole thing felt like a very low-key farce to me, which would parallel other literature between the world wars. It is interesting as an analysis of the hardships facing academia in the face of the sort of widespread political changes, materialism, and conflict that marked the period leading up to WWII. A lot of cynicism there: the failure of governments, of order, academics, ideas, values. Perhaps it is a deep satire paralleling the inter-war concerns of 'Darkness at Noon' and 'It Can't Happen Here', but if so, it's one of the least impassioned satires I've ever read; not that it would be more impassioned if we consider it a spiritual tome.Or maybe Hesse is just dull, in earnest, and I don't remotely agree with him. That would accord with my memory of Siddhartha, which I found to be full of a rather short-sighted and egotistical personal philosophy centering on Blavatskianisms like the 'law of attraction', which still haunts the self-help section to this day.Let's say that I hope it's a bizarre satire, because I was unable to drag any other poignant message from it..", "Where do i start...I cant get past the ending of this book!

Then, for many years I left Hesse alone with my dislike of the counter-culture which developed in the United States when Hesse became widely read. I have recently returned years after retirement to reread several of Hesse's books, including, most recently \"The Glass Bead Game\". With the book's exploration of the life of the mind and the spirit and their relationship to the more basic, mundane concerns of human beings, the book's theme struck home with me when young and still does. Many people with intellectual, spiritual interests will feel the tug of \"The Glass Bead Game\". It is a work of art, deeply insightful, but long and in places something of a bore.Written in 1943, the book is set in a fictitious academic community called Castalia in the distant future, probably the 25th century. There is a feeling of distancing in the setting and yet also a feeling of immediacy in the problems addressed in the book. Castalia is meant as a scholarly community devoted to study rather than to professional work in subjects such as law or medicine which continue to be taught at more conventional universities for the more usual students interested in education as a means to a career. The book's primary character, Joseph Knecht, becomes an student at Castalia in early adolescence when his gift for music is recognized by the mysterious music-master who mentors Knecht for most of his life. Knecht remains in the Castalian community where he learns and rises and ultimately is accepted into the highest reaches of its hierarchy. Some, but not all, the scholars at Castalia play what is known as the Glass Bead Game. The details of the game remain obscure but its point is to find the underlying ideals and unity underlying all human knowledge. A heavy sense of philosophical idealism and monism underlies the game. Knecht becomes a master of the game and at the age of 40 becomes the \"Magister Ludi\" the person in the Castalian order with highest responsibility for the game, its teaching, and its annual festival. At the height of his powers, Knecht becomes disillusioned with Castalia and leaves the order for the outside world to teach and soon dies.The book is slow and extraordinarily detailed. This befits its theme but makes for a lengthy, deliberate reading experience. \"The Glass Bead Game\" shows beautifully the allurements of the life of the mind with focus on music, literature and mathematics. Castilians are also taught meditation; and the book combines both Eastern and Western wisdom. Readers who have ever been in love with study or spirituality will understand the appeal developed in this book.Hesse also describes the necessarily slow awakening and change in Joseph Knecht. In his early days at Castalia, Knecht became known as a debater who eloquently championed the values of the order against a challenger from the outside world. As Knecht advances, he meets others who challenge his commitment, including his brilliant but highly erratic best friend, a historian-monk in the Benedictine Order, and a reclusive sage of Ancient China. These characters are slowly and well-developed and are modeled on various historical figures. Knecht's interactions with these and other individuals and his own reflections ultimately result in his leaving the order. He continues his love of the mind and the spirit. He concludes that matters of mind and spirit must not be pursued in isolation as in Castalia but rather in the messy world outside the order. And so people of a certain bent will think about themselves and their actions, in Castalia, in Hesse's day, and in ours. The book has an unusual organization. It is recounted by a nameless, pedantic narrator. It begins with a long introductory chapter about Castalia and its history before proceeding for most of the length of the book with the biography of Knecht. The final 100 pages or so of the work are an appendix with includes poems and three lives written by Knecht during his years as a student. These are integral to the book and show the issues Knecht faced during his life transported to earlier, far different times.The book is highly internalized with little in the way of action. Readers should be prepared to spend some time with the work which under the best of circumstances will be a struggle to read in places.Not every reader will care to follow this book. I was glad to revisit Castalia, Joseph Knecht, and Hesse again and to think about how the themes addressed in the book have played out in my own life.Robin Friedman.", "The Glass Bead Game.

People from far away travel to the province of Castalia to witness the annual multi-day festival of games. Castalia: The separate, secluded republic of scholars, artists, and glass bead players. The province supplies its elite talent from the best students of the outer world and teaches them to join the austere order, to devote their life and eventually become glass bead players. Josef Knecht is one of them, Knecht's life the subject of the story. He'll become Magister Ludi, the primary master of the game, the one who everyone looks up to.Hesse provides an uptopia here, but it's one that's bound to fail. The place, Castalia, is nothing but an ivory tower on feet of clay. The glass bead game, to me, is so far evolved and sophisticated as it is, that even the scholars and teachers cannot provide anything of real substance. Everything changes, but nothing is new. Glass bead players don't create, they merely ruminate. They pick and choose the best bits to fit them into their game. It's without purpose. Hesse foresees the downfall of occidental culture long before it happened and tells it through the eyes of his protagonist. Knecht finally breaks the cycle and does what no master of the game has done before. He learned the lesson and changed his job, but it's too late. Knecht's bequest is this: A poem.

Hesse creates a reality in which an intellectual elite has created an entire society that lives above and beyond the rest of the world playing an incredibly esoteric game that seeks to connect all knowledge as a series of symbols. There were a number of things that struck me in this world. First of all, the connections to modern science, with its own increasingly abstracted symbology, are staggering. We are actually creating worlds that are removed from reality. Years of study are necessary to participate and understand what is going on in science and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, there is cause for concern that maybe we aren't doing a good job of bridging the divide between science and the layman. Over time this breach could become a real problem. Moreover, I see this breach as a logical extension of the increased specialization that virtually every career requires nowadays. How long before a large number of individual intellectual empires crop up? Will we stop being able to communicate altogether?I was also fascinated by Hesse's exploration of ambition/balance. I think he really fleshes this concept out in the posthumous writings of Joseph Knecht at the end of the book. At any rate, it's a problem I grapple with all the time. There is a huge desire to find meaning in life through accomplishment, but this desire only opens us up to greater strivings to find that elusive peace of mind. I think we should be ambitious, but I think it is important to strike a balance and find a way to be happy with what we have already accomplished and where we are in life. .", "While Hesse's masterpiece has the same theme as Siddhartha, it's not the same short, simple work as that classic.

The academic society he builds is dedicated to the art of arranging these symbols in a sort of game. Hesse doesn't go into depth here: he's simply uses this game as a device to show 1) an elite society dedicated to this game, and 2) a way to represent how devotion to studying a worthy cause is not in and of itself the meaning of life.

As Castalians, the elite of the elite in the country's intellectual world, most of the characters have given up worldly pleasures and devote their life to the Order and Game - a 'Life of the Mind'.I really wanted to love this book (the concept of the Game was grand), but in the end I felt that something was missing - perhaps I wanted more of the actual Game, perhaps the Castalian world was too refined and complete, while being so distant from the real world, and somehow, I enjoyed reading it but maybe it was too technical and dry.Out of the three short stories, included in Joseph Knecht's Posthumous Writings after the main, biographical section, I thought the latter two, The Father Confessor and The Indian Life were great pieces. These three short stories were Knecht's Lives, fictional autobiographies (coming out of a fictional biography!) that he wrote in his years of free study.Incidentally, there was a rather considerable amount of students who not only more or less believed in the idea of reincarnation, but also in the truth of their own fictional Lives. Thus the majority of these imaginary pre-existences were not merely stylistic exercises and historical studies, but also creations of wishful thinking and exalted self-portraits. The authors cast themselves as the characters they longed to become. They portrayed their dream and their ideal. Furthermore, from the pedagogic point of view the Lives were not a bad idea at all. They provided a legitimate channel for the creative urge of youth. Although serious, creative literary work had been frowned on for generations, and replaced partly by scholarship, partly by the Glass Bead Game, youth's artistic impulse had not been crushed. In these Lives, which were often elaborated into small novels, it found a permissible means of expression. What is more, while writing these Lives some of the authors took their first steps into the land of self-knowledge.Incidentally, the students frequently used their Lives for critical and revolutionary outbursts on the contemporary world and on Castalia. The teachers usually regarded such sallies with understanding benevolence. In addition, these Lives were extremely revealing to the teachers during those periods in which the students enjoyed maximum freedom and were subject to no close supervision. The compositions often provided astonishingly clear insight into the intellectual and moral state of the authors.(pp. 104-105)The three short stories are enjoyable even standing alone, but after reading Knecht's biography, they are much more meaningful. Some colours I thought the biography, and Joseph Knecht himself lacked or were not able to attain, the Lives brought them into the picture. One excerpt I liked from the other Life, The Rainmaker, is below:...A pupil of meager character but high intelligence or sparkling imagination invariably embarrasses the teacher. He is obliged to transmit to this pupil the knowledge and methodology he himself had inherited, and to prepare him for the life of the mind - and yet he cannot help feeling that his real and higher duty should be to protect the arts and sciences against the intrusion of young men who have nothing but talent. For the teacher is not supposed to serve the pupil; rather, both are servants of their culture. This is the reason teachers feel slightly repelled by certain glittering talents. A pupil of that type falsifies the whole meaning of pedagogy as service. All the help given to a pupil who can shine but cannot serve basically means doing harm to service and, in a way, a betrayal of culture...(p. 449)This is my first review on goodreads, and I owe Hesse for stimulating in me the relevant cacoethes scribendi. Two things I will take away from this book are a slightly increased interest in learning meditation, and a slightly increased interest in learning some Latin words so I can use them gleefully.March 29, 2015."], "shelves": ["favourites", "german-language", "german", "mainland-european", "5-stars", "classics", "literature", "european", "switzerland", "1001-books", "20th-century", "german", "fiction", "reviewing-this-from-memory", "literary", "2014", "classics", "philosophy", "authors-i-love-who-failed", "modlit", "20th-century", "read-in-translation", "germany", "novel", "utopias-and-dystopias", "1001-list", "fiction", "philosophy", "re-read", "favorites", "german-lit", "know-thyself", "favorites", "germany", "g-philosophy", "g-science-fiction", "g-fantasy", "e-3", "german", "modern", "science-fantasy", "philosophy", "mathematics", "highly-regarded", "science-fiction", "linguistics", "favorites", "cognitive-science", "social-sciences", "history", "transcendent-experiences", "german-lit", "realism", "reviewed", "philosophy", "germany", "novel", "utopia", "favorites", "classics", "fiction", "2022", "favorites", "eyes-on-the-prize", "top10", "favourites", "nobel-winners", "translated", "swiss", "german", "reviewed", "translated"], "id": 26}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "The Waves", "author": "Virginia Woolf", "avg_rating": 4.15, "review_count": 35475, "url": "/book/show/46114.The_Waves", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 27}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "Chess Story", "author": "Stefan Zweig", "avg_rating": 4.28, "review_count": 98823, "url": "/book/show/59151.Chess_Story", "description": "Chess Story, also known as The Royal Game, is the Austrian master Stefan Zweig's final achievement, completed in Brazilian exile and sent off to his American publisher only days before his suicide in 1942.

If you tend to find novels by such giants as Proust, Joyce or Mann a bit intimidating but still would like to do a careful cover-to-cover read of a masterpiece, this is your book. A special thanks to Joel Rotenberg for translating from the German to a most accessible and clear English. And keeping in the spirit of a game of chess, below are several quotes from the novel (SZ\u2019s moves as white) paired with my comments (countermoves as black):Ruminating on what it takes to be a chess master, the narrator notes: \u201cAll my life I have been passionately interested in monomaniacs of any kind, people carried away by a single idea. The more one limits oneself, the closer one is to the infinite; these people, as unworldly as they seem, burrow like termites into their own particular material to construct, in miniature, a strange and utterly individual image of the world.\u201d ---------- Zweig\u2019s novel takes place during the time of Nazi Germany and, of course, Hitler is considered one of the modern world\u2019s most notorious monomaniacs, combining gobbledygook notions of biology, race, history and national identity into his version of an unyielding jackboot philosophy of culture, a philosophy carried out in deadly practice by thousands of loyal Nazis, monomania crushing the lives of millions under its ideological hammer. Parallels between Czentovic and the F\u00fchrer abound.\u201cThey did nothing \u2013 other than subjecting us to complete nothingness. For, as is well known, nothing on earth puts more pressure on the human mind than nothing. . . . you were hopelessly alone with yourself, with your body, and with these four or five mute objects, table, bed, window, washbasin; you lived like a diver in a diving bell in the black sea of silence.\" --------- Confined to a hotel room by the Gestapo, cut off from the outside world, Dr. B begins to go stir-crazy in a world of silence and solitude, a conundrum touching on a major dilemma in the modern West \u2013 the loss of the contemplative/meditative dimension in life. Silence and solitude could provide fertile ground for personal spiritual growth if one has the proper training; but, alas, for most people, similar to Dr.B, silence and solitude is equated with a blank, a total nothingness.\u201cI had not held a book in my hands, and there was something intoxicating and at the same time stupefying in the mere thought of a book, in which you could see words one after another, lines, paragraphs, pages, a book in which you could read, follow, take into your mind the new, different, diverting thoughts of another person.\u201d ---------- Ah, isolation in silence and solitude heightens Dr. B\u2019s appreciation for what many of us might take for granted \u2013 the wonder of all the various levels of splendor in the simple pleasure of reading a book. When we look closely, such simple pleasure contains infinite richness.\u201cAt first I played the games through quite mechanically; yet gradually a pleasurable, aesthetic understanding awoke within me. I grasped the fine points, the perils and rigors of attack and defense, the technique of thinking ahead, planning moves and countermoves, and soon I was able to recognize the personality and style of each of the chess masters as unmistakably as one knows a poet from only a few of his lines.\" ---------- How about that! Beyond the bare mechanical lies the juice of the aesthetic dimension, that is, an experience of beauty, in this case, the beauty of chess\u2019s underlying structure on multiple levels: each move, creative tactics and overarching strategy, especially the beauty of signature moves, tactics and strategies of individual chess masters.\u201cMy white self had no sooner made a move than my black self feverishly pushed forward.\" ---------- On the level of chess, the white pieces vs. the black pieces; on the level of psychotherapy, we could consider two different aspects of the subconscious: White Self vs. Black Self. Sidebar: Too bad Dr. B\u2019s chess book didn\u2019t contain chess problems constructed for one player!\u201cWhen I was taken to be examined by a physician, in my derangement I had suddenly broken free, thrown myself at the window in the corridor and shattered the glass, cutting my hand \u2013 you can still see the deep scar here.\u201d ---------- At one point, Dr. B notes how chess is a game of pure mental calculation, \u201ca game of pure reasoning with no element of chance.\u201d Ironically, through pure chance, Dr. B survives throwing himself at a window, since, in his derangement, he could easily have lost his life when the glass shattered. So, in this sense, life is not a game of chess \u2013 chance plays such a major part in everybody\u2019s life.During the chess game of Czentovic vs. Dr.B, the narrator observes: \u201cSuddenly there was something new between the two of them: a dangerous tension, a passionate hatred. They were no longer opponents testing their ability in a spirit of play, but enemies resolved to annihilate each other. Czentovic delayed for a long time before making the first move. It was clear to me that this was intentional.\u201d ---------- Oh, how a game can so easily and quickly degenerate into a power play of egos bent on complete obliteration of the other; how easily life can be brought down to the mindset of the Nazis.The narrator continues to watch; he detects a profound change come over the ordinarily serene Dr. B: \u201cAll the symptoms of abnormal excitation were clearly apparent; I saw the perspiration appear on his brow while the scar on his hand became redder and stood out more sharply than before.\u201d ----------- Perhaps the author is reminding us that in our countering Nazi mentality we are continually prone to become no less brutal and single-minded then a Nazi..", "Chess Story by Stefan ZweigIt's a brilliant novella written just a year before the author's death by suicide.

In a mere 80 pages, Zweig\u2019s Chess Story, reaches an emotional and psychological depth that leaves the reader shivering with horror through a haunting allegory of Nazi Germany where human lives are mere wooden pieces to be strategically moved and sacrificed by an indifferent hand.Zweig\u2019s grasp on human nature is chillingly accurate, and the few characters presented come alive through such simple descriptions of their psychology, made easily accessible through having a psychologist serve as the narrator. Czentovic, the reigning world chess champion, quickly develops into a lifelike monomaniac through the brief summary of his life. This apathetic, uneducated youth miraculously develops a keen intellect for chess, being described as \u2018Balaam\u2019s ass\u2019 when his talents are revealed, and quickly defeats chess masters across the world which \u2018transformed his original lack of self-confidence into a cold pride that for the most part he did not trouble to hide.\u2019 Zweig presents us with a highly unlikeable adversary, a wealthy, self-important man who looks upon all those around him as if they \u2018were lifeless wooden pieces\u2019 despite his vulgar manners and \u2018boundless ignorance\u2019 towards anything intellectual aside from chess (there is a wonderful aside where the narrators fried remarks \u2018isn\u2019t it damn easy to think you\u2019re a great man if you aren\u2019t troubled by the slightest notion that Rembrandt, Beethoven, Dante, or Napoleon even existed?\u2019). We can all put a face to this character, we\u2019ve all encountered someone vain and offensive who, despite our disdain, will always be able to sneer down upon us because we are no match to the one talent they hold most dear. While aboard a steamship, the passengers arrange a chess match with the great Czentovic, him versus all others, in which he crushed them in the first game without hiding his arrogance of being the superior. Enter our hero, Dr. B, an immediately likeable, shy and nervous man with an immense intellect that bestows a method for forcing a draw with the great chess master. For the majority of the novella, the reader must face the horrors of Dr. B\u2019s pas to understand where his talents grew, somehow blossoming in the cracks of soul-crushing interment in the Gestapo headquarters. Often relaying the story in the second-person, the use of \u2018you\u2019 brings the reader into maddening solitude of Dr. B, enduring his pain along with him, and even the most calloused of readers must come away with a residue of unbearable horrors and madness forever coating their consciousness. Zweig, having fled his home in Austria in fear of the Nazis, forces the reader to witness and endure a fate worse than the sickening dehumanization and deathly labor of a concentration camp, but to share in his solitude, emphasized in frightening proportions by Dr. B\u2019s torment that is \u2018a force more sophisticated than crude beating of physical torture: the most exquisite isolation imaginable\u2019.The allegory presented in the novella is sickening enough to rot any heart. We have Germany ruled by an inhumane, obdurate hand, cold and calculating in each move it makes, and we have the artistic mind going mad in solitude. Creativity and art is trampled by the sinister, calculating powers that march forward seeking victory, unshaken by the countless lives that must be sacrificed to achieve it. Chess, however, is a game of two sides, black and white, and Zweig pushes his allegory even further to represent this duality. As in the \u2018blind\u2019 games played in Dr. B\u2019s head, Germany undergoes schizophrenia of sorts, declaring war on itself by seeking to exterminate those within, be it for their religious or political views. While chess becomes a solace to Dr. B, it can also be observed as a metaphor of National Socialism \u2013 what had roots as something empowering, something to cling to in order to rise up from the depth of depression (ie. his solitude or the state of Germany post-WWI), can become something fierce, violent and destructive as history has revealed and as is seen in the mania that grips our hero in this tale. Zweig displays a mastery over his writing much as his characters do over chess. While the subject matter is sure to weigh heavy on the mind\u00b9, the writing comes across effortlessly and pleasingly, almost as if it were intended to purvey an uplifting, humorous tale. I had a laugh as Zweig probed my own literary pretentions, casting Czentovic\u2019s vain disinterest and quick removal from the vicinity of a chess match between two \u2018third-rate\u2019 players as being \u2018as naturally as any of us might toss aside a bad detective novel in a bookstore without even opening it, he walked away from our table and out of the smoking room.\u2019 The language flows and manages to embrace the reader through its simplicity, although it drags along a heavy burden with it. There was one aspect of the narrative that specifically caught my attention, and as I am still just a blind child testing the waters of literature, I would like to present to those of you whom I look up to this query of mine. Zweig often has his narrator connect the dots for the reader, such as when Czentovic states that he allowed the draw to happen, saying \u2018I deliberately gave him a chance\u2019, a few lines later the narrator asserts that \u2018as we all knew, Czentovic had certainly not magnanimously given our unknown benefactor a chance, and this remark was nothing more than a simple-minded excuse for his own failure.\u2019In my initial read of the book I had written that I found some elements to seem overly explanatory, though as Traveller so eloquently pointed out (see comments below), Zweig uses a nested-narrative style and the author and characters point of views are separate, with many of the dot-connecting moments being rational details the narrator would add. Something I enjoy about this website is the ability to connect and discuss books with people and gain a new perspective. Another thing I enjoy is being able to revisit my own thoughts and see how they have changed/developed/etc over the years. Thanks to everyone who has ever engaged on book chat here, it makes for a really fulfilling experience.Chess Story is a tiny powerhouse of depth. The conclusion had me pacing back and forth in the snow smoking a cigarette to calm the ever-increasing beating of my heart. It is horrific, it is harrowing, it is pure brilliance floating from the page. Despite it\u2019s small size, this is not a novella to be taken lightly, as it will leave a dark cloud over your thoughts once the final page has found its way into your heart. Zweig is a master of the human psychology, and a master and condensing such potent messages into a tiny novella. The clash between an uncaring, calculating intellect and the manic but human mind of a hero will grip you until the end, which comes both mercifully soon (this book is easily read in an hour), yet far too soon. The allegory is ripe and shakes you to the core.4.5/5\u00b9 The fact that Zweig eliminated his own map shortly after completion of Chess Story will come as no surprise, for the darkness this story wallows in is something that an optimistic mind wouldn\u2019t dare approach. As Nietzsche said: \u2018 if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you\u2019. When I was at the edge of my teenage years, a former English teacher and close friend of mine warned me of wallowing in the darkness of literature and philosophy, telling me \u2018the longer you flirt with darkness, the more it seeps into your soul\u2019, which, while being a spin on the Nietzsche quote, has never left the back of my mind. From that I learned to climb out from the depths and appreciate things that satisfy a lighter side of myself, the white side of the chessboard, without spending all my time feeding the darker side. Without such guidance I wouldn't be here to write this today.\u2018But is it not already an insult to call chess anything so narrow as a game? Is it not also a science, an art, a unique yoking of opposites, ancient and yet eternally new, mechanically constituted and yet an activity of the imagination alone, limited to a fixed geometric area but unlimited in its permutations, constantly evolving and yet sterile, a cogitation producing nothing, a mathematics calculating nothing, an art without an artwork, an architecture without substance, the only game that belongs to all peoples and all eras, while no one knows what god put it on earth to deaden boredom, sharpen the mind, and fortify the spirit? Where does it begin, where does it end?\u2019.", "This is how you write a novella. Well written, gripping, intense, insightful, educational and emotional.

Chess was all I could think about, chess moves, chess problems were the only form my thoughts could take; sometimes I awoke with a sweaty brow and understood that I must have unconsciously gone on playing even while I slept, and if I dreamt of people, all they did was move like the bishop or the rook, or hopscotch like the knight.\u201dWe never are formally intr\u201dMy pleasure in playing became a desire to play, a mania, a frenzy, which permeated not only my waking hours but gradually my sleep too. Chess was all I could think about, chess moves, chess problems were the only form my thoughts could take; sometimes I awoke with a sweaty brow and understood that I must have unconsciously gone on playing even while I slept, and if I dreamt of people, all they did was move like the bishop or the rook, or hopscotch like the knight.\u201dWe never are formally introduced to Dr. B. We meet him during a chess match aboard a ship bound for South America when our narrator and some acquaintances of his are taking on a grand champion, Mirko Czentovic. They are being beaten handily until Dr. B. steps forward out of pity or probably more likely being pushed by his own mania for the game. I\u2019m not a fan of chess or any game for that matter. I\u2019ve played some hands of poker without becoming too jittery, but for the most part, participating in games (I\u2019m told it is an essential part of being social) is not my cup of tea. I will be sitting there, moving domino tiles about, or fiddling with scrabble squares, or waiting to move the Scottie dog (I won\u2019t play at all unless it is understood I\u2019m always the Scottie) to Park Place or Ventnor Avenue, and be wistfully moping for some intersection to come along so I can return to reading my books. Which is a nice segway into what really began this obsession for Dr. B. It was a book. Incarcerated by the Nazis, battered mentally and physically, with no relief from the boredom and anxiety between bouts of interrogation, he gets an opportunity to steal a book. He takes the book. \u201dMy knees began to shake: a BOOK! For four months I had not held a book in my hands, and there was something intoxicating and at the same time stupefying in the mere thought of a book, in which you could see words one after another, lines, paragraphs, pages, a book in which you could read, follow, take into your mind the new, different, diverting thoughts of another person.\u201d Of course, he is disappointed it is a chess book. He would give an appendage for a novel by one of the great ones. A book he can escape into and take a mental vacation somewhere far, far away from his present circumstances. Needless to say, chess proves to be equally, if not more, diverting for his feverish brain. I do understand the concept of playing chess in your sleep. I often catch myself reading in my sleep. I wake up the next morning and realize I\u2019m as mentally fatigued as when I went to bed because I am reading page after page all night long. As far as I know, I don\u2019t retain anything from these hours of reading, but maybe it is locked away in my brain somewhere waiting for a good thump on the head to spill it out into useful memory. Stefan Zweig and his wife Lotte.Stefan Zweig was one of the most widely, internationally read authors at his death in 1942. He wrote these long, complex sentences and paragraphs, but with puffs of air beneath them. I just read and kept reading. It was impossible to stop. It was as if I had a stiff headwind behind me that pushed me along. I didn\u2019t intend to read this book in one sitting, but his writing certainly compelled me to continue reading. After all, one can\u2019t stop in the middle of a waxed slippery slide. Zweig was understandably soul sad at what was happening in Germany and across Europe. It was simply too much for him to live with. He and his wife had a suicide pact and died together. He was a monumental loss to literature. Take it from me, I\u2019m the last person to want to read a book about chess, but the compelling elements of understanding the mind of Dr. B. make the chess merely a backdrop for the real game being played for the sanctity of his sanity.

Experience alone, without the capacity to reflect upon it, provides rigid rules for responding to situations which never quite repeat themselves. Reflective ability creates the ability to cope with entirely novel conditions through the power to re-shape the rules, to imagine alternative experiences. By standing, as it were, outside ourselves, we are able to create a context for ourselves, and consequently meaning.On the other hand this reflective ability implies a \u201cself fragmentation into the white ego and the black ego\u201d and the potential for an \u201cinduced schizophrenia\u201d or, more generally, for debilitating mental illness. Pushed to an extreme of sensual deprivation, Zweig suggests, we may be able to save ourselves from insanity through imagination. But this route to salvation is dangerously close to a different kind of insanity. We are tempted to move from an absence of meaning to an obsessive singular meaning which dominates the self that creates it.The implication of course is that neuroses are purposeful, even heroic responses to difficult circumstances. Having used these neuroses successfully, they threaten to become habitual. And it is at that point we need some sort of friendly helping hand to avoid disaster. Not quite Freudian therefore, but very Viennese.Postscript: An interesting recent philosophical piece on the same general idea may be found in Sloman and Fernbach\u2019s The Knowledge Illusion: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show....", "e4 e5 2.

I am not a good player of chess and I remember how an uncle of mine that he was the one who taught me, he always beat me, every single game, and only once I was able to beat him, I was still a little kid but I clearly remember still how I ran around the house celebrating my victory over my \"teacher\".Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 Nf6And interesting enough, I remember (this time not so many long ago) when I was on vacations in a jungle lodge along with my then girlfriend and meanwhile we were waiting for a lodge's boat for a river tour, quite early in the morning, we were on the lodge's game room and there was a chessboard. She asked me if I was interested to play meanwhile the boat would be ready. We play, she lost, and we never play chess anymore in the trip. Qb3 Qe7There is an odd effect when we lose on a chess game. I think that anybody thinks that the victor is smarter than the loser. Even, there is the odd custom to think that any chessplayer, and even more a grandmaster must be a really intelligent person. If someone is really good at poker, people can consider him/her like a \"wiseguy\" and/or a \"street smart\", but in chess? Oh, they must be intelligent!Nc3I remember a trivia about the movies of \"X-Men\" that the production team had to look for a chess teacher for Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen, since they needed to do some scenes playing chess,... adn they didn't know how to play chess!!! I couldn't believe it! Two old BRITISH actors whom seemed so wise that didn't know how to play chess. Again, the common preconception of society that intelligent people should know how to play chess. Curiously enough, they didn't need to do any complicated moves and nevertheless they looked for a Chess Grandmaster to teach them!c6It was amusing how this short story reminded me about three TV episodes from the Star Trek franchise: \"Let that be your Last Battlefield\" (The Original Series, 1969), where you have the last two surviving aliens after a terrible war between two races of a planet where ones had \"black\" on the left side of the body and \"white\" on the right side, and the others just the opposite positions of the same colors. \"Peak Performance\" (The Next Generation, 1989), where a Federation strategist master, who is quite arrogant, sure of himself on his tactics' knowledge, puts on test in war games to the Enterprise-D's crew. And finally \"Chain of Command\" Parts 1 & 2 (The Next Generation, 1992), where Captain Picard is captured and submitted to a cruel interrogation. Since Chess Story was originally published on 1942, I wouldn't be surprised that the writers of those episodes took inspiration from several elements of this short story to develop their own scripts.Bg5 b5It's quite interesting that the narrator of this story, while he is present and even he interacts with the main characters, one doesn't know what is his name and even he is not really pivotal on the evolution of the events.Nxb5And commenting about that, it's quite odd to pick \"protagonist\" and \"antagonist\" in this story. Sure, you can hasten on calling Czentovic as the \"antagonist\" and Dr. B as the \"protagonist\". However, is that simple? Both has complicated issues, both has conflictive personalities depending the situation. Surely, you can sympathize easier with Dr. B's past but... is Czentovic really guilty of how he is now? Or his own past is also kinda exculpatory of his current personality?cxb5Maybe Czentovic and Dr. B are playing in \"black & white\" boards but hardly they can be seen in so pragmatic absolutes, instead they have a lot of shades of gray.Bxb5+ Nbd7. 0-0-0Something that impacted me on the reading of this crafty short story is that both main characters, Czentovic and Dr. B, they share an equal sad trait... both lost the joy of playing chess. Sure, both are masters on the royal game, but honestly, neither of them are enjoying to play it anymore. Rd8. Rxd7 Rxd7I couldn't dare to know for real what Stefan Zweig wanted to tell to his readers but at least to me, I got an important lesson: You shouldn't never to get so obsessive while doing what you do for love, reaching a level where you don't enjoy anymore of doing it.Rd1Everybody has passions but when you get obssesed about it, you lose the joy of doing it. The most important thing is to keep enjoying whatever you do for the fun of doing it.Qe6Life is too short. Enjoy whatever you do. And even something that it's considered as a hobby, an activity of relaxation, can be perverted if you don't enjoy anymore while doing it.Bxd7+ Nxd7Commenting about something else, I can't avoid to tell how much amusent provoked me when the priest, who took care of Czentovic, exclaimed: \"Balaam's ass!\" Honestly, I don't what a priest usually says when he is shocked or when he needs to curse, but reading that exclamation was priceless. So funny!Qb8+I am truly glad of having read this short story and I hope to read some more material by this author in the future.Nxb8 17. Rd8#Checkmate!

In some editions, the title is used for a collection that also includes \"Amok\", \"Burning Secret\", \"Fear\", and \"Letter From an Unknown Woman\". Driven to mental anguish as the result of total isolation by the National Socialists, Dr B, a monarchist hiding valuable assets of the nobility from the new regime, maintains his sanity only through the theft of a book of past masters' chess games which he plays endlessly, voraciously learning each one until they overwhelm his imagination to such an extent that he becomes consumed by chess. After absorbing every single move of any variation in the book, and having nothing more to explore, Dr B begins to play the game against himself, developing the ability to separate his psyche into two personas: I (White) and I (Black). This psychological conflict causes him to ultimately suffer a breakdown, after which he eventually awakens in a sanatorium. Being saved by a sympathetic physician, who attests his insanity to keep him from being imprisoned again by the Nazis, he is finally set free. After happening to be on the same cruise liner as a group of chess enthusiasts and the world chess champion Czentovic, he incidentally stumbles across their game against the champion. Mirko Czentovic was a peasant prodigy possessing no obvious redeeming qualities besides his gift for chess. Dr B helps the chess enthusiasts in managing to draw their game in an almost hopeless position. After this effort, they persuade him to play alone against Czentovic. In a stunning demonstration of his imaginative and combinational powers, Dr B sensationally beats the world champion. Czentovic immediately suggests a return game to restore his honour. But this time, having sensed that Dr B played quite fast and hardly took time to think, he tries to irritate his opponent by taking several minutes before making a move, thereby putting psychological pressure on Dr B, who gets more and more impatient as the game proceeds. His greatest power turns out to be his greatest weakness: he devolves into rehearsing imagined matches against himself repeatedly and manically. Czentovic's deliberation and placidness drive Dr B to distraction and ultimately to insanity, culminating in an incorrect statement, after which Dr B awakens from his frenzy.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0647\u0641\u062a\u0645

For those uninterested in chess, very little of the story has to do with the details of the actual games played. The story is set on an ocean liner traveling from New York to Buenos Aires.Our narrator has only a passing interest and limited ability at chess but he becomes intrigued when he learns that the world chess champion is on the ship headed to a grand master matchup. The world champion is a person who is called an \u2018idiot savant\u2019 in the book, or more properly these days, an autistic savant. He has hardly any social skills and will only play if he is paid. The narrator finds that another man is interested in playing the master too; this other man is wealthy and puts up the money for matches. Meanwhile a fourth main character appears on the scene, out of the crowd who has been watching the on-board games. (Pun intended.) He starts giving them advice and he seems to be some kind of chess master himself. (The savant plays against the group as a whole and lets them jointly discuss their moves.) As that latest man tells his story to the narrator, he becomes the main focus of the book. I won\u2019t say too much because it\u2019s a short book and I don\u2019t want to give it all away, but the man learned chess as a respite while he was being forced by the Nazis to reveal where wealth was hidden in the Catholic churches in Austria. The man had worked as the financial lawyer for the Church. He played chess against himself as he told half-truths to his tormentors, so his chess playing against himself becomes an extended metaphor for his dealings with the Nazis. (I had not known this, so I read on Wikipedia that Hitler confiscated money and art from the churches and closed many monasteries.)After this ordeal, the man vowed to never play chess again but the grand master is impressed and wants to challenge him. A good story with some psychological depth. This book is also published under the title The Royal Game. Zweig (1881-1942), was a prolific author with 25 or so books. He was at one time considered the most translated author in the world.

It may sound strange- so it is and Zweig is but only pleasantly, more you will come to know through the course of this review. Chess, the \u2018Royal Game\u2019 is not just a book it\u2019s a gamChessStefan ZweigBefore the start of review, let me put across a warning to all probable readers of this novella that this book has two active beings- one is the reader of course but other one is the author himself, he keeps on following you or rather your moves right to end of the book or the game more appropriately. It may sound strange- so it is and Zweig is but only pleasantly, more you will come to know through the course of this review. Chess, the \u2018Royal Game\u2019 is not just a book it\u2019s a game of life. The book has written like the game itself wherein it occurs to the reader every move is maneuvered by author after response of the reader. As you progresses through the book your mental faculty expects a few switches as per the developments in the narrative but, it come across as if the author is playing an active role in it and somehow he manages to gauge your expectations, and then changes his moves to tease the reader for further assimilating the new developments and expect some new adaptations however the author manages to win this intriguing tussle. The reader has been thrown across some pleasant tricks throughout the plot however overall it\u2019s an enriching experience altogether. As Chess, the \u2018Royal Game\u2019- the game of genius- works upon intellect of human being by walking over chance. The book is not just about \u2018the game\u2019 rather is a treatise of human life- as most of the books by Zweig are. It\u2019s a story of survival of human being through different patches of life when circumstances are not friendly to him, he is thrown in space less void where he doesn\u2019t have any distractions to keeps his mental muscles moving and away from madness. Eventually, after winning it through game of life, he got a distraction to evade his space less void but he becomes so beguiled by this distraction that it turns out to be an obsession. Zweig\u2019s grasp on human psychology is immaculately accurate, and the characters are infused with life with bone chilling depiction of their nature without any hesitation, the reader may feel as if he is actually seeing them going through various patches of grief and agony. Czentovic grows up as a human being who has total apathy towards world, nothing seems to interest him, he does nothing until he is requested to do so, doesn\u2019t enjoy company of other children. He is totally aloof towards his surroundings. However, gradually develops interest towards \u2018the royal game\u2019 but his interest was quite uncharacteristic of a human being. Even though he lacks the imaginative power to chalk out different possibilities in the game as grandmasters normally use to do but that couldn\u2019t hamper his stupendous rise in the royal game. He develops into a dogged character who has son sense of ridiculous towards world but his character lacks emotions which is so core to being of a man. Gradually, the curiosity (aroused due to uncharacteristic nature of Czentovic) of the reader transforms into sort of indifference, which is somewhere deep ridden in your consciousness that you realizes it only through the end of book. The mental faculty of Czentovic never helped him to envisage even a single game, every game he just attempts on the board.As soon as the reader starting to feel somewhat oblivious towards character of world champion, the author makes a masterstroke- he throws an outstandingly intriguing character- Dr.B- across the reader; who gets awestruck by the genius of Dr.B as he helps McConnor to manage to pull off an upset against Czentovic. Now the reader has again taken aback by the stupendous genius of Dr.B who immediately beomes hero of the story. However, inquisitiveness of the reader takes lead off all his/ her emotions, the reader is thrown to deep horror stories of Nazi camps. The space less void which is as good as vacuum, where Dr.b was confined, sends chills across the spine of the reader. The solitary confinement in a complete vacuum, a room hermetically cut off from outside world, as intended to create pressure not from without, through violence and the cold, but from within, and to open lips of people eventually. There the reader meets the horrifying reality of Nazi confinements wherein one was left irredeemably alone with oneself in soundless depths. One may have thoughts with oneself but even thoughts, however insubstantial may be seem, need something as a reference to fix upon, or they begin to rotate and circle aimlessly around themselves; even they fail to tolerate vacuum, so lifeless were those confinements. There the identity of human beings was reduced to be just subjects for Nazi forces; the consciousness of man was made devoid of every sense of existence in those timeless, space less voids wherein you don\u2019t have anyone to explain that how that terrifying void gnaws at you, mocks your existence and destroys you into utter nothingness. And we stare coldly at godless world of Nietzsche and the famous phrase- nihilo ex nihilo- comes to life. Eventually, Dr. B somehow manages to get a reference (a book about chess tournament games) to put his thoughts around it but he goes to the extent that he develops a kind of madness about it.  No sooner had the thought entered my mind than it worked like strong poison; suddenly there was a roaring in my ears and my heart began to hammer, my hands turned cold as ice and wouldn\u2019t obey me.  First all at once I had an occupation- a pointless, aimless one if you like, but an occupation that annihilated the void around me. In those one hundred and fifty tournament matches, I had wonderful weapon against the oppressive monotony of my own space and time.   My delight in playing turned to a lust for playing, my lust for playing into a compulsion to play, a mania, a frenetic fury that filled not only my waking hours but also came to invade my sleep One stumbles upon two interesting characters somewhat similar in nature- in principal maybe- yet so contrastingly different. On the one hand, you have Czentovic who doesn\u2019t gain priori knowledge towards the game- the life- but attempts the game- the life- as it comes to him. While on the other hand we have, Dr. B who has imagined and worked out all possible outcomes in \u2018the game\u2019 of life but in the process he becomes obsessed with this idea to such extent of madness that \u2018the game\u2019-the life- itself becomes oblivious to him. But one aspect is common among both characters- lust, madness and obsession. Perhaps, that\u2019s how \u2018the game\u2019-the life- is you may plan out all possible (outcomes possible which may seem to you) outcomes but still you might not be able to crack it since \u2018the game\u2019 has actually to be played on board and may be unpredictable more often than not. Here, as the reader may have developed a sense of sympathy and emotional connect with the character Dr. B, the author- as he seems to be active throughout the book- makes another marvelous move and ripped off you with all your assumptions but the reader left in a surprising wonder which left him/ her stunned or rather numbed. And suddenly your feelings start to retort towards disgust and apathy, and it\u2019s \u2018checkmate\u2019 by the author. Zweig always flabbergasts me with his amazing control over the prose- he psychological acumen is breath-taking somewhat like that of Kawabata and seems to have put so much depth in characters in so few words, his mastery over his writing here is as much as his characters do over chess. One may feel envious of the ability of Zweig to be able write as if he was not making an endeavor at all. His prose comes across the reader so effortlessly and pleasantly that it doesn\u2019t occur to reader that it a tale of human psychology- treatise on survival- and not a comic tale. It\u2019s just utter brilliance flowing through 80 odd pages. For though the size of the book may be small but the depth it has would certainly stir your mental faculty and would strike straight into your heart.Highly recommended, esp. for someone who loves to plunge into deep abyss of human psychology! 4.5/5 .", "\"But how could so rapid a rise to fame fail to turn such an empty head?\"[Portrait of Chess Players, \u00a9 Marcel Duchamp.]\"...the mysterious attraction of the \u2018royal game\u2019, the only game ever devised by mankind that rises magnificently above the tyranny of chance, awarding the palm of victory solely to the mind, or rather to a certain kind of mental gift.\"Stefan Zweig`s Chess (also known as The Royal Game), which is acclaimed as his finest masterpiece novella, was written in the year 1941 when the w\"But how could so rapid a rise to fame fail to turn such an empty head?\"[Portrait of Chess Players, \u00a9 Marcel Duchamp.]\"...the mysterious attraction of the \u2018royal game\u2019, the only game ever devised by mankind that rises magnificently above the tyranny of chance, awarding the palm of victory solely to the mind, or rather to a certain kind of mental gift.\"Stefan Zweig`s Chess (also known as The Royal Game), which is acclaimed as his finest masterpiece novella, was written in the year 1941 when the writer was living in the Brazilian city of Petr\u00f3polis. This story can be termed as part-memoir as the writer is also a part of the novella in the form of the narrator. When Stefan Zweig was exiled and facing danger from the Nazi regime, he is forced to go on trips across the Atlantic to find a safe place, and finally decides on Brazil. This novella may be an account of some of the experiences during these journeys. This story is written in a unique style, as Stefan Zweig presents the main story as the overall structure, with the first \u2018internal\u2019 story into the background of the world chess champion Czentovic, and the next story is about the main character Dr B. The writer presents the protagonists and the related stories in an interesting way, and the reader can clearly understand the importance of each character. And, all this is done in a novella (short novel) format. A very well-written and thought-provoking story! Extraordinary writing.--After reading about the life of Stefan Zweig, this story made much more sense. It so deeply depicts the inner turmoil that the writer, who is one of the best-known writers of the 20th century, must have been going through. [Stefan Zweig, https://www.dw.com/en/a-humanist-in-e...]Born in an Austrian Jewish family, Stefan Zweig has begun writing since his school years and has travelled widely across the world. During the Nazi regime, the writer considered his life to be in danger and was forced to leave the homeland, along with his wife Charlotte. Even though Stefan Zweig was far away from the effects of the war in Brazil, he could not withstand the overwhelming sadness and depression of losing his home. \"I was to retch and retch on my own thoughts until they choked me, and in the end I had no choice but to spew them out.\".", "This book is about the workings of the mind.But before I go into that, let me start by saying that to me the name of Stefan Zweig evokes a feeling of nostalgia. Of course, this is foremost due to the title of his famous memoirs, and because we know that he belonged to a world that was disappearing. And probably because he realized this he decided to depart from it.But for me it creates an additional longing. It makes me yearn for a world in which I did not yet exist, a world that followed Zweig\u2019This book is about the workings of the mind.But before I go into that, let me start by saying that to me the name of Stefan Zweig evokes a feeling of nostalgia. Of course, this is foremost due to the title of his famous memoirs, and because we know that he belonged to a world that was disappearing. And probably because he realized this he decided to depart from it.But for me it creates an additional longing. It makes me yearn for a world in which I did not yet exist, a world that followed Zweig\u2019s. In particular the beginning of this novel, which starts out in a ship travelling from New York to Buenos Aires, at a time when these two cities, together with Shanghai, were the most cosmopolitan centers in the world, made me think of a few decades later when my parents were young and left their country and boarded on ships that would take them to New York and to Buenos Aires and other places.Nostalgia is also part of our fantasy.Zweig\u2019s novella is a meditation on the nature of the mind: how it creates its own reality, how it lives thanks to sensations and perceptions, but also on how it can get trapped and fall prey to circular thinking.His story makes you think about the heart of imagination, what is the feeling of anticipation and how an inner mental projection can elicit joy. Zweig presents how curiosity provides a pleasure that the mind needs, but if this curiosity is not tamed it can also enslave the mind. Similarly, surprise is conceived as sudden state that gives fresh air to the mind. For the reader it is easy to identify those mental phenomena, because Zweig focuses on the effects that an object, which is both simple and complex, can provide. Such delicious and nourishing food for the mind is brought about by a book.Through Zweig\u2019s writing we observe the process of thinking and learning and problem solving, and how these constitute the gymnastics of the brain. The mind needs to explore its limits and exert itself. It needs to surmount obstacles and for this some degree of discipline is required. Understanding, creativity, the power of the brain when it concentrates on a single task, the agility and flexibility that it is capable of-- all of these aspects parade through this tale.We also see that if the mind\u2019s nature is abstract it, however, also has to be able to project outside itself. It needs to record what is in the world and absorb it, and if its space and universe is limited, its locked up habitat will be disastrous. This is what Zweig calls materielle Exterritorialisierung.By studying what happens to the mind when it is put in a vacuum, in isolation, when it is on a diet of sensory stimuli, which is its vital source of energy, Zweig creates a situation of despair, a monotony that would only sound like a single tone with no rhythm. He presents us the mental existence of Nothingness, in which one can only enslave himself (Der Sklave des Nichts).Because related to sensory input and the capability to project onto larger space, for the mind, in spite of its cogito abilities it is essential to be able to deal with one of the most abstract concepts: it needs to measure time. If one is deprived of a system of proportions, time just does not exist: it conflates. And the mind is in the void.It is then that consciousness can split, because the mind has turned against itself, and dichotomies and paradoxes and impossibilities relish in this new schizophrenic self. The poisonous obsessions possess the psyche. Anxiety and patience confront each other like opposing players in a chess game.Either Nonsense or a new Self emerges.And of course, all of the above is developed through a gripping plot..", "\u201cHe would cast a single, seemingly cursory glance at the board before each move, looking past us as indifferently as if we ourselves were lifeless wooden pieces.\u201dThis novella is my introduction to Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. He\u2019s not entirely unknown to me, however, as I\u2019ve seen numerous reviews of his work and have been interested in reading him myself for quite some time.

He\u2019s not entirely unknown to me, however, as I\u2019ve seen numerous reviews of his work and have been interested in reading him myself for quite some time. It\u2019s important to understand a bit of his background before reading this story. Zweig was born in Austria and then fled to England with his wife in 1935, just prior to the Nazi takeover of his homeland. Five years later he retreated from there to Brazil, only to then commit suicide, along with his wife, in 1942. Chess Story is an allegorical work in addition to being semi-autobiographical as well. We are introduced to Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion, on board a passenger steamer bound for Buenos Aires. The date is post World War II. Czentovic\u2019s greatest triumph is his mastery over the chess board, but he cannot claim any other intellectual or artistic talents. It would be easy to liken him to his countryman, Adolf Hitler, and it\u2019s not difficult to guess this is exactly what Zweig had in mind.\u201cFor the instant he stood up from the chessboard, where he was without peer, Czentovic became an irredeemably grotesque, almost comic figure; despite his solemn black suit, his splendid cravat with its somewhat showy pearl stickpin, and his painstakingly manicured fingernails, his behavior and manners remained those of the simple country boy who had once swept out the parson\u2019s room in the village\u2026 Like all headstrong types, Czentovic had no sense of the ridiculous; ever since his triumph in the world tournament, he considered himself the most important man in the world\u2026\u201dOn board the ship there are a few chess enthusiasts, but certainly not one that is a match for Czentovic. This doesn\u2019t stop them from challenging him to a game, which Czentovic agrees to for a price. Not only that, he will play the lot simultaneously. An uneven match perhaps, but not for a man with Czentovic\u2019s extreme arrogance. Now, I\u2019m not a chess player. I\u2019ve never even watched a single game. It doesn\u2019t matter one bit whether or not you are a fan. The gripping psychological suspense begins when a mysterious stranger steps in to join the game. Simply known as Mr. B, we are in the dark about his background until our narrator learns his story and relays it to the reader. If he\u2019s not a chess champion himself, then how did he become so highly accomplished in the art of the game? Has Czentovic finally met a worthy opponent?\u201cPeaceable, idle passengers though we were, we had suddenly been seized by a wild, ambitious bellicosity, tantalized and aroused by the thought that the palm might be wrested from the champion right here on this ship in the middle of the ocean, a feat that would then be telegraphed around the globe.\u201dThe tension truly ramps up to a frantic pitch as Mr. B\u2019s story is unraveled. I\u2019ll let the next reader discover the details, but it\u2019s a story charged with extreme isolation, mental anguish, and the will to survive and preserve one\u2019s sanity. Mr. B must serve as a self portrait of Zweig himself and the despair he felt at his growing sense of isolation as he was forced to flee further and further from his place of birth. The chess board serves as the battlefields of Europe, where black was pit against white. Fascism and Nazism versus Liberalism and Democracy. It\u2019s a stroke of genius condensed into a short story under the guise of a mental pursuit. I\u2019m even more inclined than ever to continue my exploration of Stefan Zweig.\u201cBut there\u2019s no way to describe, to gauge, to delineate, not for someone else, not for yourself, how long time lasts in dimensionlessness, in timelessness, and you can\u2019t explain to anyone how it eats at you and destroys you\u2026\u201d.", "The chessplayer and the non-chessplayer will read this classic novella in different ways.

Chess should be the noble game of the story, and even appears to be so for the uninitiated. It is only after a great deal of work has been invested trying to master it that its true nature becomes clear.Tragedy indeed....", "Stefan Zweig created an extraordinary, exciting, thought provoking novel in a typical, virtuosic self-writing style.", "...nothing on earth exerts such pressure on the human soul as a void.

If we are meant to be good and we are not, our mind have lost the battle against a deviation. Or against our true nature. Now that is a depressing thought.I had this book on my to-read shelf for months. And I wasn't going to read it this soon. A Goodreads group crossed my path and here I am. I am so glad it did. I was missing a brilliant, perceptive observer of the human condition. Zweig had a keen eye to deal with the psychological aspects of human beings with the simplicity that characterizes great writers. Humble erudition is what makes me love an author. Complicated writing and pretentious words are fine if they are used properly; otherwise, everything is forgettable. I don't only need to know that you know; let me learn too. Black. White. The mind has to choose. A million possibilities lying in a black and white board with sixty-four little squares dividing A from B. Day from night. Good from evil. A dichotomy present in every human life. It is there, inside, waiting for a decision. You are thinking: Which path should I take?Time. Time is needed to decide. And often it is not enough.Keep the pressure on, advance instead of defending! (14)Zweig seems to be the kind of author that share the characters' psyches without hesitation. That help us understand more. Even while writing about how the mind is supposed to work, with the complexity that such a task entails. But he succeeded and with a beautiful, simple and refreshing prose. You feel what he wrote. He tended to repeat keywords in order to emphasize a particular situation, thought, feeling, etc.; that embellishes the sentence with a unique melody.The novella starts with a recount of Mirko Czentovic's story, the world chess champion. A young man whose ignorance was universal in all fields, but played chess like no one in the world and was now visiting my dear Buenos Aires. As soon as Mirko had done his chores around the house, he sat stolidly in the living-room with that vacant gaze seen in sheep out at pasture, paying not the least attention to what was going on around him. (5)That was described as apathy. To be able to switch off the inner processes that often haunt us, just for a minute, in order to subtract yourself from reality and dwell in reverie... Or nothing. To think nothing. To want nothing. To put the restless soul in a lethargic state without knowing what is going on around us. Well...Anyway, the boy learnt to play chess only by looking at some men playing it. (Hard to imagine, and I am not saying it because I tried that when I was younger. But why on earth would I question that fact in literature? Strangest things have happened.) Czentovic was a grotesque, simple-minded boy lost in the world of the mind. A boy that in a relatively short period of time, after tasting the bittersweet elixir of money and fame, became a cold, ostentatiously proud person. Unfortunately, several times I had the unpleasant experience of seeing how a simple person that came from a humble background could turn into an arrogant figure after achieving some material success.Arrogance and confidence are two different things. And that relies on the fact that despite his annoying pride, Czentovic was still insecure. He never talked to well-educated people because he feared he would say something stupid. Behind that self-absorbed body language, an overwhelming insecurity was hidden.There is psychological material in everyone, even in the apparently simplest man of all.Black. White. A steppenwolf inside. Which nature will defeat the other? Does our opinion matter? And, which one are we? A. B. Both. The reckless combination of light and darkness. Always obsessively looking for a referent. An answer. A cure. The permanence of sanity.You were left irredeemably alone with yourself, your body, and the four or five silent objects, table, bed, window, washbasin... There was nothing to do, nothing to hear, nothing to see, you were surrounded everywhere, all the time, by the void, that entirely spaceless, timeless vacuum. You walked up and down, and your thoughts went up and down with you, up and down, again and again. But even thoughts, insubstantial as they may seem, need something to fix on, or they begin to rotate and circle aimlessly around themselves; they can\u2019t tolerate a vacuum either. You kept waiting for something from morning to evening, and nothing happened. You waited again, and yet again. Nothing happened. You waited, waited, waited, you thought, you thought, you thought until your head was aching. Nothing happened. You were left alone. Alone. Alone. (19)This novella was a delight to read. All the characters amused me or disgusted me with the same intensity. Zweig described them so vividly. His writing reflects the characters' mood with perfection. I could almost hear the sneer coming from McConnor's rage after losing his first game. I could almost see Czentovic's cold and defying eyes while playing his insensitive game. Or Dr B. predicting all the possible moves with ecstatic frenzy. I suddenly became another eager witness in the middle of a growing excitement. I could also feel the oppression of his soul while he was narrating his confinement in an empty room. I read and absorbed it all. His despair, his tedium, sorrow and fear. I was to retch and retch on my own thoughts until they choked me... (21)In conclusion, intriguing plot, interesting characters, situations described so vividly that you can almost touch them and a magnificent, accessible writing with the power to dazzle you until the end. Yes and a thousand times \u201cyes\u201d. Another writer to admire. Black. White. And we are in the middle, surrounded by many combinations, many possibilities, paths and decisions. Two sides of us coexisting in one body. Perhaps, two people writing these rambling thoughts. Thoughts and more thoughts. Questioning, torturing, haunting.We are in the middle.

Captured by the Gestapo, he is condemned to the most sophisticated form of isolation for months on end and psychologically abused during ruthless interrogations in order to extract important information related to his previous professional practice. An anthology of a hundred and fifty master games for chess is the only object Mr. B can get hold of during the long period of his incarceration and imagining those moves in his mind turns out to be the only distraction from the vacuum that surrounds him. The diversion transforms into pleasure and the pleasure transforms into mania and soon enough Mr. B\u2019s chess moves come so natural to him that they epitomize the definition of his sole existence.

Maybe an allegory for the disturbing undercurrents molding the Nazi ideology of the time. Maybe a symbol to depict the dark forces that seized Vienna and destroyed its flourishing cultural heritage.A battle between opposed understandings of the world ensues on the chessboard. Two men carrying the weight of different backgrounds on their shoulders, one in monochromatic black and the other in schizophrenic colorfulness, struggle against their pasts and impending futures and play the game of chess with antagonistic purposes. One plays to exist, the other to annihilate.A metaphorical chessboard where wooden pieces draw a map of connections among the countries before the tragedy of World War II exploded, destroying the cultural tradition that delineated Zweig\u2019s faith in art as the ultimate expression of everything that was good in humankind. Both suffering in exile, both mourning a golden past, both sinking into despair under the weight of history, both struggling to create meaning within themselves in spite of having been robbed even of their identity, both Mr.B and Zweig play the game of chess under the constant checkmate of despondency.A handful might have the courage of never losing hope, but many others fail in the attempt like Zweig did. I am made myself of many grayish contradictions, but whenever I feel the call of \u201cBlack\u201d dejection I remember a sagacious friend of mine who once told me to follow the path of wisdom, even if its ways be hard and steep.

Even at the cost of years of discipline and rationality?Stefen Zweig surely put his own constructs up the wall when he created this ingenious piece of art. Yes, it was pure art; outrightly splendid form of art that overwhelms the realms of conventional thinking and forces the mind to stretch itself.A World Chess Champion, heralded as one of the best ever to play the game, in his casual quest of pocketing a few dollars, enroute to a tournament, encounters a sudden change of fortune, when a remarkable twist of moves from a rather ordinary looking, albeit a tad hysterical, middle-aged man, hands him his first defeat in many years. Shocked, quietly brazen and visibly inquisitive, he challenges his unknown victor to another game. Nothing more worthwhile to regain lost blood. On the insistence of the vociferous enthusiasts on the cruise, our unknown hero accepts the challenge.Thus begins the artistic assembly of this man's life, Dr.B as we come to call him. Zwieg lends Dr.B an ordinary mind, with an extraordinary resilience. The human desire to overcome his limitations despite their crippling, almost strangling nature, is beautifully depicted in the little cell where Dr.B draws the most intelligent game, all within the confines of his mind. In the stunning recollection of the bygone era, Dr.B casts a dreamy net which holds layers of frantic moves, with the kings and pawns running helter-skelter, but never away from the shrewd line of sight of their master. What happens when one genius meets another in the climax, of course, is as mind-boggling as your mind can make of it!

A mere 84 pages in length, Chess Story is the last book Zweig wrote before he and his wife committed suicide. In its pages, he details his relationship with the royal game of chess. We first meet grand champion Czentovic when he is orphaned at age 14 and living in a parsonage. A reclusive teen, he uses chess to get ahead and eventually becomes a world champion. We find him here on a boat voyage traveling to a tournament. Quickly, the other passengers on the boat learn of his presence and challenge him to a simultaneous match for a fee of $250 a round. Although pricey, the players lead by the Scottish McConnor agree perhaps so one day they can tell their grandchildren that they once faced the chess world champion. The game begins and it is obvious that Czentovic is worlds ahead of his opponents. He could easily beat all of them in two moves until the mysterious Dr.B and starts directing the game. We then learn of his imprisonment and how he played chess without a board nonstop for four months until he developed chess fever. He is urged to face Czentovic and declares one and only one game will he play. Zweig created the character of Dr B to mirror himself. He details the imprisonment and how one could go mad from nothingness. Zweig himself committed suicide before this novella's publication perhaps due to a similar madness that befell his protagonist. A tedious yet short read, Chess Story appears on many modern classics lists. With well fleshed out characters, it is an interesting read that can be finished in a little over an hour. It is upsetting that Zweig did not live to write more novels, because they probably would have been just as interesting as Chess Story. .", "i will never stop recommending this book to every person I ever come in contact with", "With Zweig, I apparently started at the end : \u201cChess\u201d was sent to his publisher just days before he took his own life.

At first glance, it is the story of a handful of passengers on a ship to Buenos Aires who find out that a cold and condescending chess champion is on board, and challenge him to a game in the hopes of beating him. They all fail, of course, until a mysterious man shows up to give them a little advice on how the game is played. Intrigued, the unnamed narrator decides to ask him how he became so well versed in the strategic game. The more you dig, the less this is about chess, and the more it is about the human mind, obsession and a certain form of madness.With fewer than a hundred pages, this novella can be read in a single sitting \u2013 I personally found it difficult to look away from, and not just because the writing was fluid and engaging; as soon as Dr. B. begins his tale, I was fascinated and heartbroken. His sanity is saved by his imagination, by fighting the sensory deprivation he is made to endure, but the effect of his captivity is a double-edge sword: when he is put in a position to use the considerable powers of his mind in a practical way, things begin to break down and turn against him (if only he\u2019d known how to meditate, I found myself thinking!).There is also a clear analogy: to the Nazi regime, people were merely pawns, to be moved around or eliminated as profited them best. Czentovic\u2019s ruthless and disinterested playing style echoes the way the German war machine mindlessly trampled most of Europe (Zweig also paints his antagonist as a rude and uncultured man who becomes arrogant and greedy after a taste of success), as where the importance Dr. B (who by contrast is well-educated, humble, clever and compassionate) gives to his intellectual life represents the humanism that Zweig held in such high regards. He pessimistically seems to indicate in this story that he doesn\u2019t see how humanism can triumph over Fascism, which given the time at which it was written, is not an inconceivable position.Reading a bit about the man who could come up with such a story, I was both impressed and saddened. Impressed by the man\u2019s great productivity and obvious erudition \u2013 and deeply saddened by how his personal story ended. My understanding is that he and his wife killed themselves because the events of WWII made them feel that this horrific failure of humanity was simply intolerable; their ideals were blown to smithereens and the world they had wanted to live in had been destroyed, which made carrying on unbearable. Knowing this made the short novella even more impactful.\u201cBeware of Pity\u201d and \u201cThe Post Office Girl\u201d are winking at me from my bookshelf, alongside his biographies of Mary Stuart and Erasmus; I don\u2019t think I can keep them waiting very long!.", "Rating: 3.5* of fiveThe Publisher Says: Chess Story, also known as The Royal Game, is the Austrian master Stefan Zweig's final achievement, completed in Brazilian exile and sent off to his American publisher only days before his suicide in 1942.

The good doctor is escaping the Nazis after a horrific torture-by-isolation. Czentovic is off to new triumphs as the world's greatest living chess master. Dr. B. survived his horrible isolation by reading and re-reading and memorizing and repeatedly playing in his mind great chess games from a book he stole from one of his torturers. The stage is set...the grisly Grand Master meets the gruesomely treated noble spirit in a chess battle for the ages, and is defeated. The doctor retires from the scene, completely unmanned by reliving his horrible confinement through his victory over the taciturn, unintelligent idiot savant Czentovic.Zweig committed suicide after completing this book. I see why. It's the least optimistic, most hopeless, depressing, and horrifyingly bleak thing I've read in years. Four hankies won't do to stanch the helpless, hopeless weeping induced by reading the book, and a pistol is too heavy to hold in fingers gone too numb to clench even slightly.It's one long flashback. The \"action\" of the chess match takes on an almost lurid and pornographic tinge after the grim tale Dr. B. tells of his time with the Nazis. It's dreadful. It's downbeat. It stinks of freshly-opened coffins and crematory ovens.

And I thought it was great. It begins with an idiot savant named Czentovic who becomes a world chess champion despite his inability to maintain a grade school\u2013level conversation with anyone. Czentovic is on a cruise ship to Brazil for reasons I don\u2019t remember exactly but while he\u2019s there he makes the acquaintance of a presumed \u201clayman\u201d who demonstrates surprising chess skill against him. Upon further inquiry by another passenger on the ship (who also happens to be the story\u2019s narrator), the layman reveals his background, which is both fascinating and highly disturbing. This revelation sets the stage for a glorious mental breakdown that had me riveted which if I have to remind you again that this is a story about chess and how can that possibly be riveting, well that just speaks to the vibrancy of Zweig\u2019s writing.After having read Chess Story, I can\u2019t say that I see any obvious connection to Wes Anderson\u2019s characters, nor is any Wes Anderson plotline recognizable in it, but maybe such a connection can be found in other Zweig novels.

Editing towards this end, I think, would have raised this book from 4 to 5 stars for me. Detail is crucial in fine writing, but so is the ability to summarize and do without, and knowing when to do which is quite often what elevates the really good to the superb. Despite this criticism, I greatly admire this book, and enjoyed it very much.It resonated with me for many reasons. One being that I'm about the age she was when she embraced a life of isolation and simplicity (partial life - during warmer months primarily) on the coast of Maine. Secondly, I admire her pursuit of a simpler, solitary, more meditative life. Third, she is a skilled and interesting writer, though prone to including too many details as already noted. Fourthly, I appreciate her insights into her life and our life at large, especially with its many inconsistencies and comic/tragic complexities. Lots of good stuff here.

She's very lucky to have been supported by her now ex-husband to go off on her own, and leaving the kids behind, to different remote places over the years for the self-feeding of her inner soul, and especially for going off alone summers at a time to their little shack on a small remote island off the coast of Maine. Here she tested herself in living naturally and in oneness with nature by doing her very best to eat only what the earth provided in the way of weeds and berries for salads, and herbs growing around the cabin for seasoning, and mussels, crabs and clams for her food source. I love that she had great books on identifying wild weeds for her specific area on food sources that she could read and learn more about as the days passed. But, she ended up divorced and mentally wondered about her sanity. Admitting to being a feminist activist, I believe she had her priorities all wrong in life. She was fighting for all the wrong things. But, I don't think she put the two together.Only time alone on this island where she could think and live freely, was she finally able to separate the GARBAGE she had been indocrinated into from the real, God-given life she was meant to live. Now, this is only my opinion because I don't believe she actually saw how much happier she was to clear her mind of such self-absorbing thoughts while alone on the island. Her attentions turned from self-centered and impowering herself as a woman to protecting nature and the foods we eat. She sets the best example that she can, never perfect. She sees how we humans are destroying this earth. So do I.

I loved it then, but I appreciate it even more on this second reading. Beautifully written, almost poetry, it recounts the author's time seeking solitude and a better connection with her self on an island off the coast of Maine as she turns fifty. She lived for part of each year following, in an undeveloped cabin, securing most of her food from the surrounding earth and sea, discovering the abundance of nature in the mostly overlooked plants surrounding her home and from which she concocted delicious meals. But the book moves beyond that island to her life in New York City as an activist for women's rights and writer, a woman in a marriage that has died, a mother of two grown children who don't entirely approve of this new phase in their mother's life. And it takes her to Boulder, Colorado, where she spends two years teaching at the university and writing, while also exploring a terrain new to her ... the mountains and forests. She also engages in a protest of the nuclear weapons at Los Alamos. And always back again to the island nubble ... after ten years very much changed since her initial trips. In addition to being a fine writer, Alxx Kates Shulman is a wisdom woman, extracting the rich marrow from her experiences, reflecting, and offering it up for others to partake at the table she sets. It's a feast. Along the way we meet Margaret, ten years older than Alix, and also a wisdom woman, and Charles, Alix's found again lover ... both richly steeped in life on their own terms. But what made this book especially poignant for me at this particular time is Shulman's reflections on climate change, on the destruction of the Amazon rain forest through fires set by farmers clearing land, on the accident at Chernobyl, on the pollution of the seas and the killing of sea life, and on the use of pesticides. It's been over twenty years since Shulman wrote this book, and the world today is in worse shape that it was then ... because people don't listen and too many of us put short term profit ahead of everything else. This book is even more timely now than when it was written, and for those wanting to consider another way of being on the earth, living more gently and more intentionally, it is a wonderful guide, without setting out to be that. This book should become a classic..", "The words Alix Shulman strings across a page voice a suspension of judgment by a mind, conditioned like mine, to ignore and dismiss wonders of the world outside it.

I came to the computer to share this gem of a read after laughing so heartily. I'm dying to hint where and what she described so perfectly for my funny bone. Other reviewers have revealed the charm of a New Yorker meditating on a pool of blue mussels. Better, for me, than descriptions of sea shells by the novelist whose work forced the Senate to investigate migrant housing.

What I liked about this book: the fluidity. This IS a narcotic-fueled narrative. You are drawn to it, into it, and by it. You cannot fight the feeling of being propelled down a mine shaft. All around you, explosions, but you keep going deeper. You want to look away, shield your exhausted eyes, your fatigued brain. But you can't. You must see where this is going. Even if you think the creeping suspicions you've had since page two will come to pass, you must learn more. You need to.

I suspected that I might not be reading true fiction here. Was I? The answer is still blurred to me now. If not taken from the author's life, then surely taken from mine, from people I've seen on busses and train cars, at parties and such.

The narrator's voice is sweet, snarky, self-depricating and bumblingly honest. And, while it's easy to read at breakneck speed, the novel rides a razor's edge of danger. That's what gives the book its real strength: Gardner's ability to create for the reader the experience of painful tension between loving the narrator, wanting her to get the comfort, reassurance and relief she seeks and suffering the increasing dread that all will not end well. Plus, it's so nicely written - with simple, beautiful poetry wrung from casual, colloquial speech. The correspondence between the main character, Mary, and her charming, elusive, sleazeball lover feels particularly real and (I hate to admit it) familiar. I loved the book.

Yet he lived his life while she worked and waited till she could be with him again. it was a touching heart felt story and i truly look forward to more books by this author..", "Disturbing, brave and haunting.

Gardner's methodology is to use jump-cuts to accelerate action Once she is locked in stall with a faucet left on at full blast, she drops her head between her knees and stars taking deep breaths.Mary lifts her head from the train window and peers out over the tops of the seats in front of her... later, to even greater effect, the blurring of memory due to alcohol and drugs is evocatively depicted. now I guess technically speaking as NMG's old boss, I'm supposed to take issue with Nina-Marie's Mary's drug use while working on clients' essays. but actually as hinted at in the book, the clients loved her. a poetic mind even under the influence is more capable of story-telling than a banal engineering or economics type.anyway, enough background. what about the book?well Sherry and Narcotics is a downward-spiral addict's novel, and to that degree it bears comparison to other addict stories, Chelsea Handler's Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea, More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction/ it has a note of Austen, a note of Virginia Woolf. whatever the influences, the book stands on its own right. the protagonist, Mary, slowly disintegrates in a ruthless world, and so we call this work, again, \"dark.\" these are the good points:* the text is fluent, indeed it even accelerates. some reviewers have commented they can't put the book down. I can understand this sentiment.* all the action and the progression is believable* the book feels \"personal.\" it's on one hand the portrait of the artist as a young woman, and then simply the confession of a young woman navigating the rocky road of youthbut I felt was a little weaker:* the book does not have much political backgrounding. it's a personal story, but I don't know where it fits in the broad societal experience of the polity.well, the years have passed and I guess the opportunity to be NMG's personal friend has perhaps passed, but in any case, I'm happy to connect here on GR and I look forward to NMG's future output..", "***This Review was posted to Bookish Nina-Marie Gardner\u2019s Sherry & Narcotics is one extraordinary debut novel.

The author\u2019s virtuosic storytelling achieves a tone at once passionate and detached, and the result is as curious as it is convincing. The hypnotic narrative captivates the reader from the first sentence to the last paragraph of this beautifully written novel. It is breathtaking, intense and nerve-wracking. You might want to hold onto your seats.  Mary Cartwright is a young playwright from United States who, shortly after her father passed away, decided to move to England to have a fresh start on life. Her income consists of money she makes rewriting essays for non-native English speakers. Although it is not the highest-paying job in the world, she likes it, mainly because it gives her freedom and keeps her brain sharp. She\u2019s free to travel/live anywhere she wants as long as she can access the Internet to upload her work.  One day Marry gets a message through My Space from Jake, who claims to be deeply impressed with her plays. They start exchanging emails and text messages, and things quickly get intense between them. They\u2019re fascinated with each other, she likes his poems, he likes her writing. There\u2019s a great chemistry between them and a strong, almost unhealthy pull. Marry doesn\u2019t think twice before deciding to move to Manchester. She wants to be close to Jake, get to know him better, be a part of his life. But things don\u2019t always work out as we want them to. Sadly, there will be no \u201chappily ever after\u201d in this story, just plenty of heartache, disappointment and pain.  The true, almost nightmarish beauty of Sherry & Narcotics is the all too crystal clear mirror it holds up to its readers. Nina-Marie Gardner has written a sublime and clear-as-glass book, a book of almost frightening transparency and openness. Reading this book felt like observing someone else\u2019s life through a spyglass, invading their personal space, eavesdropping, hacking into their brain and shamelessly stealing all the intimate secrets. The strong narrative pull will keep you engrossed in the story until the heartbreaking ending. It\u2019s a thought-provoking masterpiece that will make you wonder about life, love, trust and \u2013inevitably \u2013 addiction.  Practically from the get-go there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of impending doom. We know that something bad is about to happen. We sense that this story won\u2019t end well, not for Marry, not for anyone. The loneliness, sadness and hopelessness drips from the pages and we find ourselves wishing there was something we could do to fix it. But of course, there\u2019s nothing that can be done. We can only sit and watch, and it\u2019s truly gut-wrenching.  I read this book in a single sitting. I read it ravenously, not wanting to stop turning the pages, not wanting to put it down, and even though I knew it would break my heart, I can totally see myself reading it again. I liked everything about it, the setting (England!), the explicit narrative voice, the original take on the subject of drug abuse and alcoholism, even the broken and hopeless characters. It was painfully real yet magical in a way. This book has a very artsy feeling to it and I can picture it being made into a great movie, or perhaps adapted into an even better play. Reading it reminded me in part of Dreamers (2003) and in part of Catfish (2010). Nina-Marie Gardner is a writer of rare intensity and she definitely knows how to elicit a strong emotional response from her readers. Sherry & Narcotics is a book about trying to find your place in life, struggling against devastating addiction, doing your best to keep it together, loving, hoping, losing, and falling\u2026 falling\u2026It\u2019s a powerful book, treasure it..", "For your consideration: A New Gifted Young Writer Explodes on these PagesNina-Marie Gardner is a puff of exhilarating smoke that rises out of the pages of her first novel (yes, her first!)

SHERRY AND NARCOTICS. She hails from Massachusetts (Marblehead to be exact) and has tiptoed through many jobs and experiences including acting that most assuredly gave her exposure to the flotsam and jetsam that inform her created characters. In an interview she was quoted as saying 'I am most interested in writing about people on the fringes: the loners, the losers, the quirky and/or invisible types. The quiet wallflowers who do the observing. The late bloomers. The ones who maybe have fallen through the cracks, the deeply flawed but big-hearted, the lost but relentless. I care most about keeping it real and honest and true. I am interested in writing about women and addiction and recovery. Language matters a great deal to me; I also hope to expose readers to a perspective or emotional place they might not have considered before.' And those goals and concepts are met completely in this immensely readable book. To reveal too much of the story in a review would be a disservice to the reader as the real pleasure of steeping into SHERRY AND NARCOTICS is the clever way Gardner mixes ruminations on the part of her main character, the American Mary who travels to Manchester, England after a brief but desperately needy Internet correspondence/date with one Jake who lives there. Mary has problems related to alcohol and drugs - problems that she uses to manipulate her courage to tie down a physical and emotional need with the lanky blue-eyed redhead Jake - a fellow not without his own set of problems. Gardner's forte is her humanism coupled with her creative writing style. She often relates internal conversations without the use of the repeated name of the speaker/thinker. Little sample: 'Mary shifts her knapsack, feels for her wallet, her cell phone. Walks clear across the stations, and out on the large set of sliding glass doors. To her right is an arcade of shops, to her left what looks to be a main road with a tram line. The wind has kicked up, so she ducks over to a stoop just outside a greasy spoon to light her cigarette. Holds it near her face, taking quick deep drags, enjoying the here and the now. People filtering past, the occasional tram, the sky cresting - now a soot-tinged peach.' She then pops into emails and Internet tags and jumps her places in a prancing that keeps the reader immediately at her smoky/smelly side. And yet for all of Mary's mismanagement of her life we love her. Nina-Marie Gardner: we will be hearing alot about her. Start here. This is a great launching platform!

Sounds like the title of a Best Album by a New Artist Grammy award winner. The words written on the pages themselves inside the book aren't catchy, but they're certainly memorable. \tMary Cartwright, the protagonist, is a struggling young playwright from the States who, shortly after a stint in rehab and her father's death, moves to England. There, thanks to the Internet, she supports herself by helping non-native English speakers write coherent essays in English. Of course, while the Internet is valuable for entrepreneurs, it is also a gem when it comes to making connections with others. Others like Jake, the proverbial \u201cdark, handsome, mysterious stranger\u201d who sends Mary messages of admiration through Myspace (okay, perhaps this is a little 2007, but stay with me, it's worth it). \tThe love story between Mary and Jake takes Mary to Manchester, where she moves to be closer to him. Jake, who is initially intriguing, attentive and charming, quickly morphs into an emotionally unavailable lout, and his behavior borders on despicable. But we love who we love, and for Mary, vulnerable and broken, Jake is her slurring, staggering white knight. Their affair consists of ingredients many twenty and thirty-something women will find familiar\u2014drinking, lovemaking, writing, lies, and half-truths. It isn't sweet, nor is it terribly romantic. However, it is gripping and real. \tGardner expertly conveys the depths of Mary's passion, longing and hurt. Mary may be a junkie for a lot of substances, but most of all, she seems to be junkie for closeness, connection, and the sensation of being touched and held. When that sensation dries up, withdrawal takes over and fear rises to the surface, seeping from her pores. Yet for women like Mary, who are raised with high expectations, where mantras are from commercials telling them that \u201cWe girls can do anything\u201d and \u201cNever let them see you sweat,\u201d fear and yearning are too unbearable to feel. Mary's solution is to stuff them away with bottles of red wine, knowing the Merlot will quell her insecurity, if only for an hour or two. \tIf you're no stranger to co-dependency, Sherry & Narcotics is a must-read, as the book feels like an old friend. On the other hand, if co-dependency is new territory for you, this novel by Nina-Marie Gardner is the real deal; you can live through it vicariously (without the hangover the next day). PS--If I could, I'd give this 4.5 stars..", "As the mother of women roughly the same age as the protagonist Mary, I found this novel both a compelling and a heartrending read.

It opens with graphic narrative scenes of Mary, drunk and drugged, participating in sexual acts with random partners. Later there is a flashback to an actual rape and beating. Throughout I wondered what was the childhood history that propelled this young woman to put herself in such danger. The novel soon moves into a pattern of dialogue carried on via emails and texts between Mary and her new, sweet love, Jake. Mary is a playwright so carrying the story forward this way makes sense and the author is extremely good at it. The emails and texts between Mary and Jake bring a smile to the face and a flutter to the heart. The time spent waiting for those emails and texts inspires anxiety. The reader feels each moment along with the character. There is also the undercurrent of tension between Mary and her mother. A brief telephone conversation between them is particularly poignant, giving the reader a hint of a painful and complex history in very few words. In fact, the entire book moved along like a film in my mind\u2019s eye and I think it could be easily transformed into an excellent film. Jake, not a bad guy but an indecisive one, ultimately lets Mary down and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoiling the story by disclosing that since the end of their sweet affair is skillfully foreshadowed throughout. Then, when it seems Mary has hit bottom, two miracles occur at the very end: she rescues a dog from a cruel and brutal death and two strangers turn out to be kind and help her in this endeavor. Of course she is overwhelmed in a good way by this kindness from strangers who in the past she had learned to fear, so the book ends on an upbeat note that begs for a sequel. In fact, since the details of Mary\u2019s family and childhood history are never explained and given the enticing nature of this book, I would like to see both a prequel and a sequel because the author made me care deeply about what past moved Mary into this particularly painful present, as well as what her future holds: hopefully sobriety, self awareness and appreciation, and the unconditional love of dogs. I recommend this book be read when the reader has time to read it start to finish, you won\u2019t want to put it down..", "Sherry and Narcotics was a bullet train that drove Gardner's narration from its pages straight into my heart.

Nina Marie Gardner goes straight for the jugular from page one and doesn't let go until the very end. The tension continuously ebbs and surges keeping the reader wishing and pulling for the main character, always unsure of her final fate.I enjoyed the intermixing of the narrator's voice with text messages and emails not only as an ingenious mean to propel the story along; but one that belongs to our age. This is masterfully done, giving the book an overall harmony in movement with changes in rhythm that keep the reader in constant suspense. Not a dull moment here.To say that I was undaunted by the main character's plight would be a big fat lie. I fell for Mary and her struggles from the very first page. My heart went out for her and I admit that it did ache upon reading the ending of her first night back on the bottle.A very easy read, albeit an exhilarating one. A deceivingly simple voice that is poetically rich without being pretentious. The descriptions of the scenery is rich in detail, be it a pub, the city of Manchester, the lobby of a hotel or a posh restaurant, the reader is given the full spectrum of sensory experiences that only a very conscious and honest writer can render vivid and fully alive. It was precisely through the strength of her descriptions that the author managed to keep me in constant touch with our heroine Mary and the crescendo of trials that she underwent. From very early in the book, Mary stopped being a fictitious character and quickly became a good friend. I found the ending soothing and subtle leaving me calm and relaxed. It wasn't overplayed, nor spelled out, but very satisfying.I strongly recommend this book and I am positive that it's one of those that I'll get back to. .", "As soon as I turned the last page of Sherry & Narcotics I could feel a tiny little piece of heart breaking of.

Sherry & Narcotics takes readers into the mind of a young women named Mary who struggles with grief, loss, love, addiction and isolation in Manchester. Her story soon unravels and readers will begin to connect and understand this character and what she is going through.Mary's addiction with alcohol soon becomes obvious and I started to feel protective of her in some way. I read through the whole book without flicking till near the end. It is a very sad and happy yet compelling story and I simply couldn't get enough of it. The author tells the story in such a way that you can't help but be happy for Mary and want things to turn out perfect for her. I knew from the very beginning that there was something up with JKake and I got proved right. Although he had a kind of irriestible charm about him and he seemed genuinely nice.

For how long can one cling on to them with a quiet desperation? Long after grief subsided, long after the ache dealt by the blow of tragedy dulled, Ruyu, Moran and Boyang continued to let their lives revolve around their coping mechanisms. In place of a youthful lust for life and unbounded optimism they made a gaping emptiness their constant companion, drew strength from their blunt indifference to the world at large, never caring for the interminable flow of time and living from one moment to the next one. No expectations from those who touched their lives fleetingly. Relationships established and subsequently shed like second skins just as easily. An impenetrable fog of nothingness separated these three individuals from the world around them. Deeply afraid of tenuous attachment, they chose the secure comfort of solitude.Orphaned in infancy, Ruyu had her perception of morality blurred by the blind religious fervor with which her grandaunts tried to indoctrinate her and later by Shaoai's everyday small cruelties. Disillusioned with life at a tender age, she could only snub gentle Moran's offer of friendship with acid contempt and wield Boyang's love for her as a weapon to harm others. Her act of transgression (not without its reasons) - perhaps triggered by the vindictive nature of adolescence - brought turbulence into the lives of three souls and destroyed a fourth, the aftershocks of this incident continuing to haunt them decades later across continents.Ruyu knew she wasn't going to be let off unscathed by fate either but then what could possibly intimidate a misanthrope who treated life like a prison and considered the act of living akin to a sentence meant to be served out in silent despondency?\"She was not the only one trapped by life. She was afraid of meeting another person like her, but more than that she was afraid of never meeting another person like her, who, however briefly, would look into her eyes so that she knew she was not alone in her loneliness.\"Yiyun Li is my new favorite author of Chinese origin simply because she manages not to succumb to the lure of sketching a Beijing under an autocratic regime like so many of her peers, choosing instead to narrate a tale of heartbreak and loss which will remain as affecting even if one strips her characters of their ethnicity and shifts the backdrop of events to any other place and time. It is the flawed humanity of the ensemble characters, none of whom are completely beyond reproach, and their self-inflicted emotional isolation which establishes Li's ability to go beyond the limits of spick and span pigeonholing. The devastating aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the agonizing chokehold of the Communist administration over its citizens are simply hinted at and never spelled out for the sake of inducing any cheap sentimentality. And what elevates her craft further in my eyes is the languid beauty of her prose and her accurate portrayal of the melancholia and ennui entailing the quandary of life. \"They were not her stories. They were not about her time, or her people, but what she had once found in these stories-escape-would eventually become her wisdom.

Where to begin......\ud83e\uddd0This novel feels like many genres. Fusion dishes of suspense- murder mystery light - or perhaps simply murder mystery \u2018irrelevant\u2019 - [note: the mystery will be clear in the end - but the bigger mystery to me was why \u2018friends\u2019 had such a hard time closely connecting - rather they lived very solitary lives] - Continuing on...... as what to expect in this book:Beijing & American culture in the year 1990 - historical fiction - literary psychological thriller fiction - coming of age - part fairy tale - immigrant/orphan story - and a family/community saga over a twenty year span. The characters are a variety-pack-special: The multi-layered package include troubled, idealistic, pessimistic, arrogant, sweet, and emotionally crippled people. They are imprisoned by their past lives and scrutinize their futures. This novel opens with the murder of 22 year old Shaoai....a university student and political protester. She died - in Beijing - from chemical poisoning....which was stollen from a friend\u2019s mother\u2019s science laboratory. It seems that either Shaoai killed herself (drinking the poison)....or one of her other three friends did. [Boyang, Ruyu, or Moran]. All sounds pretty clear and straight forward - right? Wrong! Remember I said this book is a fusion of genres.....So rather than follow a plot moving us toward the conclusion as to who killed Shaoai....its more about how her friends coped with her death for twenty years.. And what was the state of Shaoai\u2019s life? Another question is why did the case go unsolved? Most of the story follows Shaoai\u2019s three childhood friends: (more contemporary-acquaintances than friends really) Ruyu, Boyang, and Moran. These three: Ruyu, Boyang, and Moran are COMPLETELY DIFFERENTThis novel is introspective in nature. The novel goes back and forth between the present lives and past lives of the characters - from when they were teenagers - to their adult lives. THESE CHARACTERS BECOME GLUE IN YOUR BRAIN! THE WRITING is so beautiful - with fascinating curiosity of these characters - that just by reading it - thinking about it - I\u2019m sure it\u2019s preventive - organic - the secret to the Fountain of Youth. If baby boomers want to know how to keep themselves young and vital\u2026chew on this complex novel. Great brain workout! A few excepts I enjoyed ( there are many more)........then my brain is going to rest:\u201cWhen we place our beloved in front of the critical eyes of others, we feel diminished along with this subject being scrutinized\u201d. \u201cThe freedom to act and the freedom to judge, undermining each other, amount a little more than a well-stocked source of anxiety. Is that why Ruyu wondered, Americans so willingly make themselves smaller\u2014 by laughing at others, or more tactfully at themselves\u2014 when there is no immediate danger to hide from? But danger in the form of poverty and flying bullets and lawless states and untrustworthy friends provides, if not a route to happiness, at least clarity to one\u2019s suffering\u201d. \u201cMidsummer in Beijing, it\u2019s extreme heat and humidity occasionally broken by a revealing thunderstorm, gave the impression that life today would be that of tomorrow, and the day after, until forever: rinds accumulated at the roadside would go on rottingand attracting swarms of flies; murky puddles in the alleyways from over spilled sewers dwindled, but before they entirely disappeared another storm would replenish them; old men and women, sitting next to bamboo perambulators in the shadow of palace walls, cooled down their grandchildren with giant fans woven of sedge leaves, and one of them closed one\u2019s eyes and opened them again one could almost believe that the fans and the babies and the wrinkled-faced grandparents were the same ones from 100 years ago, captured by a rare photograph in the traveling album of foreign missionary, who would eventually be executed for spreading evil in a nearby providence\u201d.Moran and Ruyu were on the waterfront of the Western Sea, a manmade lake, in Beijing, when Moran pointed out the direction of other seas: the Black Sea, the Front Sea... etc. In the past week Boyang and Moran had taken Ruyu tourist visiting. Ruyu asked: \u201cWhy they were called seas, then?\u201d She was not interested in the answer, yet she knew that each question granted her some power over the people she questioned. She liked to watch others feeling obliged, and sometimes more foolishly, elated to answer her: people do not know that the moment they respond they put themselves on a stand for their interrogators to judge\u201d. \u201cI find your lack of interest in anything but your own little faith to be more than horrifying\u201d. Last minute thoughts....( for my own memory)....Ruyu\u2019s cynicism, righteousness, ungratefulness, and LACK OF INTEREST in \u2018anything\u2019 started to irritate me.She was the most interesting character .....the orphan. But not easy to feel sympathy or empathy for. Gorgeous novel - intellectually challenging in ways....I\u2019m left with thoughts between loneliness vs. solitude ....and how kindness embraces or doesn\u2019t in the most quiet moments of an individual\u2019s life..", "Loyalty to the past is a foundation of life one does not by happenstance or by will end up living.To be so consumed with one's choices, so consumed that every present choice is a consequence of the past; to be enveloped by guilt so vexatious that it gnaws your waking thoughts; to want to love and be loved so badly that you stop desiring love.To live by this code: People don't vanish from one's life, they come back in disguise.To live this thought daily, view everyone through lensLoyalty to the past is a foundation of life one does not by happenstance or by will end up living.To be so consumed with one's choices, so consumed that every present choice is a consequence of the past; to be enveloped by guilt so vexatious that it gnaws your waking thoughts; to want to love and be loved so badly that you stop desiring love.To live by this code: People don't vanish from one's life, they come back in disguise.To live this thought daily, view everyone through lens of skepticism, to know, without a doubt, that happiness is a misnomer. It's hard to read this book and not drown in the hopelessness of its characters, not be affected by the loss of some redeeming quality: When people talk about starting over, it is only wishful thinking; what came before, what happened yesterday, did not come or happen in vain.Here, no one starts over, everyone lives in the past. Present lives muddled by past choices: a disabled friend--who is to blame? Fleeing to America doesn't help because Ruyu and Moran only live lies, struggling to build healthy relationships, always reminded of that past act. In Beijing, Boyang, the man loved by both women, will stick around to take care of what he deems his fault. What happened? This subtle mystery abounds and unfolds through present and past narratives written with clean, intentional prose. But as you read further, you sense that there is nothing mysterious about what happened because the mystery is predictable.When love overpowers instinct, when loyalty to one's friend deters forgiveness, when silence begets crime and lives are shattered--combined, these form the underlying premise of this slow-moving, thought-provoking, rhythmic, and melancholic tale told with philosophical asides:Hardships in lives are like bad weather, which one endures because bad weather will break as inevitably as bad luck will run its course. Hope is the sunshine after the storm, the spring thawing right after the bitter winter. The goddess of fate, as capricious as she is, has nevertheless an impressionable mind..", "\u201cPerhaps there is a line in everyone\u2019s life that, once crossed, imparts a certain truth that one has not been able to see before, transforming solitude from a choice into the only possible line of existence.\u201dFor four friends, that line was crossed during their late teenage years, when one of them was poisoned, perhaps deliberately, perhaps accidentally, lingering in a physical limbo state until she finally dies years later The young man, Boyang, remains in China; the two young women, Ruyu and Mo\u201cPerhaps there is a line in everyone\u2019s life that, once crossed, imparts a certain truth that one has not been able to see before, transforming solitude from a choice into the only possible line of existence.\u201dFor four friends, that line was crossed during their late teenage years, when one of them was poisoned, perhaps deliberately, perhaps accidentally, lingering in a physical limbo state until she finally dies years later The young man, Boyang, remains in China; the two young women, Ruyu and Moran, move to the United States. Each ends up living in what the author describes as a \u201clife-long quarantine against love and life.\u201dKinder than Solitude is not primarily a mystery of a poisoned woman nor is it an \u201cimmigrant experience\u201d book, although it is being hailed as both. Rather, it\u2019s a deep and insightful exploration about the human condition \u2013 how one\u2019s past can affect one\u2019s future, how innocence can be easily lost, and how challenging it is to get in touch with \u2013 let alone salvage \u2013 one\u2019s better self.\u201cTo have an identity \u2013 to be known \u2013 required one to possess an ego, yet so much more, too: a collection of people, a traceable track lining one place to another \u2013 all these had to be added to that ego or one to have any kind of identity,\u201d Yiyun Li writes. In the case of Moran, who married and divorced an older man she still cares for,what she called her life \u201c\u2026was only a way of not living, and by doing that, she had taken, here and there, parts o other people\u2019s lives and turned them into nothing along with her own.\u201d Riyu, the most enigmatic and detached of the characters, is an empty vessel, unable to connect or to experience much pleasure or pain, who strives to receive an \u201cexemption from participating in life.\u201d And Boyang, a successful entrepreneur with a cynical sense of the world, has discovered that \u201clove measured by effort was the only love within his capacity.\u201dThis is a deeply philosophical book, one that delves into its characters, with an ambling narrative that shifts from the shared Chinese past to the present \u2013China, San Francisco, the Midwest. It is not for everyone \u2013 certainly not for readers who are anticipating an action-packed, page-turning suspense novel.

The news of the death of Shaoai, which is possibly caused by one of the three, jump starts the novel. After more than 20 years in a coma, the one tie holding these three together, is finally severed. The premise of a mystery is what attracted my attention to this novel initially, by Li's writing kept me engrossed and in need of savoring every word written. Each character in their own way, has chosen a life of solitude as opposed to a true existence filled with love, laughter, and humanity. Boyang, has risen from meager beginnings to become a man who is more wealthy than ever imagined. Moran, once a courteous teen, morphs into a chemist who finds solace in her small apartment and the occasional visits with her dying ex-husband. Finally, the most interesting yet mysterious of the three, Ruyu, lives as the odd-job queen. Kinder Than Solitude is more than just a mystery of whodunnit but rather a delving into what it means to be human; to seek lasting connections and have a meaningful life full of people who matter. Instead, these characters have chosen a life of being untangled. After failed marriages,passing flings, or basic emotionless disregard, the one thing that they do remain tethered to is the death of Shaoai.Yiyun Li provides a vivid character study of three people that are unlike any character I've come across to date in the multitude of texts I've read. Who stand out the most for me is Ruyu. She's sent to live with Shaoai's family at the age of 15. Shaoai constantly berates her for her lack of emotion or caring. Ruyu is an enigma the entire novel and never once deviates from that trait. She's logical to a fault and this makes her prime suspect number one. She seems not to care about anyone but not in the cunning way. It's more so that she's even tempered and this baffles all who come across her.Essentially, Kinder Than Solitude is a well-written expose of human nature and the beauty of solitude. I enjoyed this novel tremendously and look forward to what's next from this author. Copy provided by Random House via Netgalley .", "Solitude is not kind in the world of this novel.

Orphaned as a child and raised by two deeply religious 'great aunts', she is sent to Beijing to live with relatives where she meets Boyang and Moran. The two of them - being very close friends that grew up together - befriend her, despite Ruyu offering very little amiable surface as she stays very contained, drawn back, almost unaffected by human emotion.The only person to really be able to make Ruyu's surface ripple is Shaoai, the daughter of Ruyu's relatives, a rebel whose involvement in political protest will ruin her future. It is her death the book begins with.The beauty of this dark novel lies not in its fast pace or its drive to solve the mystery. In fact Kinder Than Solitude is a very quiet, philosophical novel with a prose so mesmerizing I wanted it to never end. Yiyun Li manages very elegantly to give an insight into a time that may have shaped and affected a whole generation in China, but she does so by zooming in on such a microscopical level that in the end, more than anything this novel to me was about the human condition, about solitary existence by nature or choice.Highly recommended..", "Let me start with the good.

As teenagers, they banded together in their communal Beijing neighborhood.

As teenagers, they banded together in their communal Beijing neighborhood. Shaoai, an outspoken dissident of the Chinese government, was poisoned, apparently an accident, in the shadow of the Tiananmen Square protests. She takes twenty years to die, although the massive deterioration begins early. Soon after this harrowing event, the three friends, in a tacit pact, drift away from one other, circumscribing their adult lives with self-imposed emotional quarantines.The novel opens in Beijing, and seamlessly alternates in time and place between China and America. As the story examines the lives of Boyang, Moran, and Ruyu, as teens when the tragedy occurred and now as middle-aged adults, their shared parallels of solitude are probed, and the mystery of Shaoai's poisoning is gradually revealed. They haven't spoken to each other in twenty years, and all three are divorced, childless, and detached from passion and fulfillment.Ruyu, an orphan from the provinces, is sent by her grandaunts at age 15 to live with Shaoai\u2019s parents in Beijing. They want her to get a better education. Shaoai and her friends treat Ruyu with a haughty truculence. Ruyu, however, is an inward girl, lacking social graces, a cipher to others. She is aloof, inscrutable, and privately prays to God. She doesn\u2019t seek others out, much to their frustration.Boyang and Moran, longtime friends, reach out to Ruyu, who accepts their friendship with a general indifference. She is unused to the community spirit of her new home, where many families convene together in the shared quadrangle. Boyang is the son of wealthy college professors, who he visits on weekends; they left him to be raised by his grandmother while they pursued their ambitions. Moran is the equalizer; she is eager to nurture. For her, life was a series of ideal moments, filled with \u201ca larger dose of joy.\u201d Unfortunately, Shaoia\u2019s poisoning leaves them all contaminated with psychic toxins. As adults, they sought out lives to subvert their memories, at the same time reeling from them.\"Those seeking sanctuary in misremembering did not separate what had happened from what could have happened.\"Boyang stayed in Beijing, while Moran and Ruyu left for separate parts of America. All are locked away in prisons they have built for themselves. Boyang, divorced, is a wealthy businessman, getting by in a series of superficial relationships with younger women. Ruyu keeps herself sequestered in a restrained life as an underachiever. Moran, working for a pharmaceutical company in Massachusetts, still keeps in touch with her ex-husband, but divorced him in order to maintain an emotional void. And yet,\u201cShe was afraid of meeting another person like her, but more than that she was afraid of never meeting another person like her, who, however briefly, would look into her eyes so that she knew she was not alone in her loneliness.\u201dLi\u2019s measured narrative combines finely calibrated characters and elegant, elegiac prose. The tone evoked a grey chill, but not entirely bleak. There was a haze of something brighter around the edges of the story\u2014a wish for redemption and forgiveness. There was sympathy for their guarded enclosures, like a sweet spot buried under their memories and their isolation.\u201cTo know the world, for a child, is to ask questions, but the situation leading to those questions, once answered, are forgotten; having garnered enough knowledge, one enters adulthood only to be confronted by more questions, which, no longer answerable, form the context of one\u2019s being.\u201d.", "The best epithet for this book would be \"pensive\".Before she met Josef, she had been in Madison for two and a half months, but those days, like the time since she had left Josef, had been willfully turned into the footprints of seabirds on wet sand, existing only between the flow and ebb of the tide.(see what I mean? somehow this ostensibly simple passage is my favorite in the whole book, along with this one, where it is not about the wording but about the feeling: To be brought to an understandThe best epithet for this book would be \"pensive\".Before she met Josef, she had been in Madison for two and a half months, but those days, like the time since she had left Josef, had been willfully turned into the footprints of seabirds on wet sand, existing only between the flow and ebb of the tide.(see what I mean? somehow this ostensibly simple passage is my favorite in the whole book, along with this one, where it is not about the wording but about the feeling: To be brought to an understanding of her own foolishness like that was like walking into a wall she had never known to be there.

This is a slow moving book, but one which certainly has a lot of impact.

What happened, all those years ago \u2013 was the poisoning attempted murder, an unsuccessful suicide or a freak accident and, finally, who was to blame? With Shaoai now dead, can the three friends finally let go of their self imposed solitude and make peace with what happened?

For example, Moran, once a young girl who idolised Shaoai is now a quiet woman living in the United States. We watch her interact with her ex-husband, and have to wonder how much did that distance event with Shaoai effect her current personality, how did it touch her ex-husband and her relationship with his family, even though they never even know Shaoai existed.It is a book about experiences, and how they shape us - although be reassured, the book has a conclusion and felt complete.

Within four-month\u2019s-time these characters will become bound by secrets, violation and deception, and betrayal of love and friendship that remains with them for decades to come.Yiyun Li\u2019s novel is so tightly woven that there were moments when I had to remind myself to breathe. Her storytelling is masterful. And while the writing is beautiful---so finely wrought---I felt I was being invited to tour the psychological terrain of people who are emotionally cold. Many passages are pensive and dense with the poetry of tragic fate. Characters often ask one another questions that sound like labyrinth riddles, or traps to make one stumble en route to clarity. 14 pages until the close of the story and a long awaited reunion invokes no hugs or sentimentalities but only abrupt questions that feel forced, plastic, and loaded with presumption.With the exception of Shaoai, the young people---as they progress well into their adult lives---are destined to examine their past roles and question their motives for participating and not-participating in subsequent relationships. Shaoai is also the one character who may have been able to offer some insight into the thoughts of young political activists who protested at Tiananmen Square, but her voice was silenced before she could open her thought process to the reader and I wondered if this was an intentional metaphor for censorship on the author\u2019s part. Shaoai is also someone who has \u201cbehaved badly\u201d in secret and yet seems portrayed in an unlikeable, yet blameless light.Nothing is funny in this story and these are not happy people so don\u2019t read this book when you\u2019re in the mood for lighter fair.

The world was a bleak stopover for the sisters, in which they, armed against it with a religion that had become more of their own making as time passed, were either unaware of the shadow they cast or regarded it as irrelevant, a perennial dusk, sterility mistaken for purity, aloofness for devoutness.In the Buddhist books, Ruyu found this motto: to desire nothing is to have no vulnerability.To want to know any person better requires one to give up that position as a mystery in people's eyes, and to become less inscrutable.You, Royu said in her heart to the god she had long stopped believing in, you have my sympathy.Uncle had been one of those whose lives were saturated by unwarranted sadness, and what could be a kinder antidote to sadness than death itself?The worst battle, Ruyu thought, is fought between the innocent: not knowing how to spare themselves, they don't for a moment feel mercy for the other.She was afraid of meeting another person like her, but more than that, she was afraid of never meeting another person like her, who, however briefly, would look into her eyes so that she knew she was not alone in her loneliness.What could she say to the couple? Be brave, and be happy, you orphans with parents, you parents to future orphans.To be seen -- and to be seen as someone with a past and a future -- is that not our most sincere design for love? Our greediest, too, in wishing for such continuity, one places oneself -- with arrogance and delusion -- beyond the erosion of time.Is there not space in between lovers and strangers for us to be genuinely affectionate toward each other?Why, thought Boyang with a weary sadness, couldn't people stay in a place they could not name, rather than wanting to know, always wanting to know, more of the truth? Everything comes to an end when explained, rightly or wrongly.What Moran found in these stories -- escape -- would essentially become her wisdom. Perhaps if she kept these tales going, Josef would one day forgive her stubbornness in choosing solitude, because he, kinder than solitude, was always here for her.Boyang was wise not to fall in love with the girl, Royu said eventually.

Moran and Ruyu are both currently underachievers in America, while Boyang is a celebrated businessman in new Beijing. All three were leading a single life, having failed to keep relationships together.KINDER THAN SOLITUDE, despite its title, is not a happy read, nor an uplifting one. The premise is not just sad or heartbreaking, it is unsettling, in a manner of speaking. The core mystery was never resolved in a significant manner. It was not given enough heaviness, if indeed it is the core of the story. Neither was the sexual violation prior to the poisoning. Seems to me, they were conveniently wrapped up, when all the while the book is full of psychological discourse.Li is a masterful storyteller. I had no trouble turning each page. The prose is brilliant, no doubt, very quotable even. Hence, the 3 stars. But prose alone cannot save the entirety of a book. I\u2019m afraid that I cannot agree with its philosophy. Being remorseless because it is 20 years too late, or believing that being repentant will serve no purpose in an already done deed is not merely emotionally cold, it is morally wrong. Choosing solitude because of previous tragedy, lack of self-confidence, or self-preservation seems reasonable enough. However, settling with the knowledge that it is far kinder to be with someone who will tolerate your impertinence or inadequacy than being alone is definitely twisted in my vocabulary, especially, if that someone happens to be a murderer.I've read A SHELTERED WOMAN, so I will not readily give up on Yiyun Li.

Four young people \u2013 Ruyu, Moran, Boyang, and Shaoai \u2013 live in a Beijing hutong, a compound where people share living space. Shaoai is poisoned, and one of the other, younger three may have been responsible. The 1989 narrative alternates with contemporary accounts of the adult lives of the three survivors, two in the United States and one in Beijing. Each has failed in marriage, and each is alienated from what could potentially be a nurturing environment.The plot is wound around loneliness, the difficulty of human connectedness, and the encumbrance of guilt. These are universal woes, yet there was a particularly Chinese bent to every burden. While the author does not flog political themes, it seems likely to me that these characters can only take tentative steps toward each other in part because they live in a society also taking tentative steps away from total repression. While the theme of loneliness is surely universal, these young people carry the burden of a particular time and place.In particular, Ruyu, the central figure, has been orphaned, raised by grandaunts forced to hide their Catholicism, and she has learned to be suspicious of human contact. To have the state undermine one\u2019s religion would necessarily drive one to a hidden life, sharing confidences with no one, trusting no one. Such a household produced Ruyu, who is nearly amoral. My principal objection throughout is that the omniscient narrator is too much present, delving into one afflicted soul after another.Small steps toward redemption are gentle and a relief, but there\u2019s another bona fide takeaway from this book, and that is its durable portrait of Beijing, an ancient city rapidly disappearing, I believe, becoming something else entirely..", "this book looks at the relationship present and past between a group and can be seen at times as a bit depressing with lost dreams and hopes after an incident when they were younger and that person passes away. the book switches between past and present", "My sister gave me this book for Christmas.

Although it was described on the cover as a \"thriller\", a genre I enjoy, it is not a book that I would have picked up for myself. The author, Yiyun Li is a Chinese American writer who was born in Beijing, China on 4 November 1972. She was educated at the University of Beijing and the University of Iowa. She is a writer of some note and her debut short story collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers won the 2005 Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award. Her debut novel, The Vagrants was shortlisted for the 2011 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. Indeed, her books have been translated into more than twenty languages. She was selected by Granta as one of the 21 Best Young American Novelists under 35, and was named by The New Yorker as one of the top 20 writers under 40. She now lives in Oakland, California with her husband and their two sons.So, when I settled down to read Kinder Than Solitude, I was not sure what to expect. The story is set in Beijing and parts of the USA. It is definitely a long, slow burn. Possibly too long.The story starts with one of the main characters, Boyang, making the funeral arrangements for his friend, Shaoai, who has died after 21 years of poor health. Boyang was one of three friends, Moran, Ruyu, and himself. When they were young, they were involved in a mysterious 'accident' in which Shaoai was poisoned.Now the three friends are adults, separated by time and distance but united in guilt and suspicion by that incident. Boyang stayed in China, while Moran and Ruyu emigrated to the United States. All three remain haunted by what happened.Kinder Than Solitude tells a simple enough story, and one that lends itself naturally to the double time frame structure of countless mysteries in which present lives are rocked by the reverberations of a crime buried deep in the shared past of the main characters. Kinder Than Solitude aims high as a literary thriller. I do not think it fulfils either aspect of that hybrid genre. The reason for that is that much of the book is terminably dull. The present lives of the three survivors, Moran, Ruyu and Boyang, which occupy a large chunk of the book, are required by the plot to be punitively bleak and sterile \u2013 the spiritual equivalent of Shaoai's physical poisoning. Moran and Ruyu have moved to the US while Boyang stayed in Beijing, caring for Shaoai.The depictions of Moran and Royu's lives in the New World offer little reward for the effort of following them through their green-card marriages and sad divorces. They have boring jobs and growing isolation. Althoughtheir lives are true to a certain Middle-American blandness of tone and texture, in itself that is not enough to make them or the novel interesting.Throughout the book, Yiyun Li has a habit of adopting a moralising authorial commentary that clogs the flow of the story, and casts an aura of ponderous solemnity over the action.About halfway through, at last, things picked up a bit. The three survivors have begun to emerge to make different claims on the reader's sympathy: sweet-natured Moran with her possibly culpable innocence; Ruyu, a study in deliberate cold heartedness and Boyang, doomed to an ineffectual decency. Meanwhile, the crime itself has begun to accumulate resonances that turn it into something more than just the hook for a gruesome thriller. The reader learns that Shaoai was a political rebel. She was a supporter of the Tiananmen Square protest movement. Before her poisoning she had already sacrificed her own future for the sake of that brutally suppressed revolt and she was bitter at the cowardly silence of her fellow students after the massacre. Shaoai taunts and goads them mercilessly. Thusm her murder compels a political reading. In her, the hopes of a more open China are extinguished. Shaoai is shown as a difficult, unlikable teenager, with a gift for spreading misery. Yiyun Li is certainly a capable writer, and I am glad I read this book because I had never read any of her work before. Having said that, I found Kinder Than Solitude very dull and the clever ending was not enough to save it for me. Valerie Penny.", "This is quite an interesting book. First of all, the excellent presence of a good number of characters in such a relatively short book is very nice. Each of them, from the three main characters to Shaoai who is the prime mover of the book's problem, to Celia, to Josef, to Auntie and her family, to Boyang's mother, and so forth, is well-depicted and rings true. Second, I am actually not sure whether the characters Boyang, Ruyu, and Moran are protagonists as I understand the term. Really, they areThis is quite an interesting book. First of all, the excellent presence of a good number of characters in such a relatively short book is very nice. Each of them, from the three main characters to Shaoai who is the prime mover of the book's problem, to Celia, to Josef, to Auntie and her family, to Boyang's mother, and so forth, is well-depicted and rings true. Second, I am actually not sure whether the characters Boyang, Ruyu, and Moran are protagonists as I understand the term. Really, they are the characters whose presence occurs most consistently throughout the book. But, actually, the three rest in a field of characters, including the characters I mentioned above, but also including the shop employee whom Boyang \"dates\" for a while, and even Ruyu's great aunts, who actually never make an appearance, but who are definitely present. The author, Ms. Li, weaves all these people together and connect them even though the connections may be involuntary. In a sense, they are like marbles rolling against each other in a tin or like pebbles hitting each other on the beach as waves go in and out.Third, I wrote above that Shaoai is the prime mover of the book's problem. I used the word \"problem\" because this is a fairly plotless book. There is one significant event that scatters lives. But the book is really a study how that event affects characters, but not in the form of a plot. Instead, the characters have a problem that has intruded into their lives. It is enough of a problem to affect their lives significantly, but not enough to make them actors in a plot. Here is where I find a little bit of fault with the book. At the end, Ms. Li is looking for a resolution for her \"people\". She does find one for each of the three main characters, but the resolutions seem contrived to me -- as if Ms. Li had some trouble finding a way to end the book. Here, I though plot intruded into the problem, but was a bit too easy a solution to it. I think this is particularly the case with Ruyu and Boyang, but actually not so much with Moran whose basic disposition falls more easily into the \"plot\".Fourth, I am not sure of what world I have entered in this book. I can see the consequences of an event that has shocked the three \"main\" characters. And I can see immigrant alienation, the inability to let go and forget others even in their years-long absence, the subtleties and contrasts of Ruyu's and Moran's characters. But there are other parts of this fictional world I do not understand because, in the end, I am not sure of the ethics of the characters' society and therefore of the characters' responses to an event like a death. Although the main characters suffer an intense alienation, there is no sense of ethical responsibility and no search for a resolution of responsibility. So, ultimately and interestingly, the characters sweep the event under the carpet, and they scatter. Perhaps, this is Ms. Li's genius -- that the characters live always in the present, always with their present thoughts and circumstances, and we are left to delve into the question of their ethics as determining their behavior.In the end, the book does come to a type of resolution of the alienation at least. Moran seems to reason out what is \"kinder than solitude\" at least in her life. Boyang and Ruyu seem to resolve or begin to resolve their connection, strong in youth, yet never developed then. And so the three pick up where they left off decades earlier when they were split apart. But, as I wrote above, I think this is a weaker aspect of the book for me. What a wonderful, mysterious, cloudy book. Thank you, Ms. Li..", "This quietly disturbing novel raises questions that will be hard to shake off.

Its characters were childhood friends in the days immediately following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Two are Chinese ex-pats living in the United States and one is a successful resident of the thriving capitalist city of Beijing. But regardless of residency status, these three exist within a moral lacuna, a void created by the absence of, not kindness, but justice. Yiyun Li makes it clear that what China has in place of the rule of law is family and tradition, vapid Confucian aphorisms passed off as wisdom, and ruthless pragmatism. Ruyu, an orphan raised by grandaunts who isolated her from society and taught her that her Christian faith made her superior to others, arrives at the home of Shaoai and her parents as a boarder. She will attend school with Moran and Boyang, two best friends her own age who live in the quadrangle, an old-fashioned communal Beijing neighborhood and a quietly decent place. Or at least it is until Ruyu gets there. Her remoteness, her contempt for nearly everyone around her, wins the admiration of the haplessly affectionate Moran and the love of Boyang, the boy Moran had believed was destined for her. For Shaoai, a restless, disruptive older girl who lost her place at university due to her participation in the Tiananmen Square protests and who would have made an excellent Red Guard, Ruyu is a provocation she makes no effort to resist. The novel begins with Boyang making Shaoai's funeral arrangements and gradually reveals how she came to suffer the dismal fate that finally culminates in her death. The shock of this revelation is not so much in who did what and how, but in the absence of consequences. I'm still not sure what Yiyun Li is up to here. Is this novel a commentary on contemporary China or a modern world in moral free-fall? Can the consequences of one's actions be avoided if one simply has enough nerve? Or was justice served? Did Shaoai, in other words, have it coming? The book ends with a pair of reunions and with its three main characters rescued from nearly lifelong solitude by what can be thought of as kindness. But troubling questions remain, questions that do great credit to Yiyun Lee's skill as a novelist. .", "Relentlessly dreary from beginning to end, Kinder than Solitude presents the world as a dusty repository of heartless, futile hostility.

When Shaoai is poisoned, quite possibly by one of the other three, their lives move in different directions and they become separated.

And yet, while my overwhelming sense is of sadness and loss, there\u2019s something beautiful in the way Yinyun Li tells this story. Moran, Ruyu, and Boyang each help others but cannot allow others to form attachments to them. Would their lives have been different if Shaoai had not been poisoned? Who poisoned Shaoai, and why? There are many questions raised in this novel, and few clear-cut answers. For me, the actual events twenty years ago became less important than their continuing impact. This is a novel that has invited me to think about how lives are influenced and unfold.

After all, Li has described this novel as also being, in part, her love letter to Beijing where she grew up. And, as the title implies, this is a book about three adults who chose to remove themselves from family ties to be alone, which isn't really odd in America (to where two of them move) but is unusual for Chinese families where extended family is close\u2014even across the Pacific. (For instance, I love Yiting more than I love my own sister.) However, like most of Li's writing, this is also a book that refuses to be precious and strips away illusions and drama.

First, the fundamental mystery was never resolved in any meaningful way: while we did learn who was responsible for the poisoning, it was totally unclear why, and likewise unclear what motivated the sexual assault that preceded the poisoning. Second, Ruyu's character was so sparely drawn, and so harsh, as to be almost a caricature of a character.

At any rate, I am so happy I read it.I LOVED THIS BOOK !!Just like it says in the title of the book, Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine....well she thinks she is. She is honestly not worried that she may be missing out on anything. She is content with her life.Eleanor is a little bit....odd. She's very intelligent and well-spoken with impeccable grammar (thanks to Mummy) but she lacks the ability to filter what she says and therefore she will tell you exactly what she's thinking. This can lead to very awkward situations.Eleanor is comfortable with her routines. She's worked at the same job for nine years. She starts work at 8:30, at lunch she buys a newspaper which she reads from cover to cover and then does the crossword. She finishes out her day, leaving work at 5:30. Eleanor listens to the Archers as she makes a simple dinner (usually pasta and salad - one pan one plate), watches TV or reads for a little while then off to bed at ten. Her weekday routine only changes on Wednesday when she talks with \"Mummy\" for ten minutes. Weekends are a bit different. After work Friday she picks up pizza, wine and two big bottles of Vodka for the weekend. She drinks the vodka over the weekend.....in a state where she's neither drunk nor sober, waiting for Monday to come. No one comes over and she doesn't go anywhere to visit. She sometimes wonders if she's a figment of her own imagination.But she's fine with it. She's fine. There's nothing missing, she doesn't need anyone else. Well that was what she told herself. But then it happens...\"He was light and heat. He blazed. Everything he came into contact with would be changed. I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I found him\"Now Eleanor is on a mission. First she decides a make-over is in order....and where she starts is both shocking and hilarious. I really want to write about what happened but I think I would spoil a very funny moment for many readers.Things don't go exactly as planned.When her computer at work stops working she meets Raymond from IT. An easy-going guy, Raymond is intrigued by Eleanor, but she's just not interested. She's busy trying to re-create herself for the man of her dreams. But after work one day Eleanor and Raymond come across a man who has fallen on the sidewalk. Together they help the man, Sammy and so begins a friendship along with the start of many changes in Eleanor's life.The story is told from Eleanor's point of view. We go along for the ride as she navigates her way through her life, learning to stand up for herself. But it won't be easy. Secrets and memories that have been tucked away for many years can be painful to remember.When you have trouble with social skills I can see how it would be easier to refrain from situations where things could go wrong so fast..... It would be easier being alone. As I mentioned there are many funny moments throughout the book. I really like how the author wrote these parts. I never felt like I was laughing AT Eleanor but at the things she said or the situations she ended up in. However, there are also many sad and painful moments. Times where I felt terrible for Eleanor.Some of the funniest parts came out of nowhere - the phone doesn't ring often but if telemarketers call Eleanor whispers \"I know where you live\" and hangs up. Often it was what she would be saying to herself that was funny.An incredible read that had me bouncing from one emotion to the next. The author did a tremendous job bringing these wonderfully unique characters to life.It's hard to believe this is the author's debut novel.There are so many words that can be used to describe this novel - hilarious , unique, heartwarming, heartbreaking, charming, hopeful, inspiring, and COMPLETELY unforgettable.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!.", "5 Stars.\u201cEleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine\u201d but after finishing this novel, I am not.

I was completely unprepared for the life of Eleanor Oliphant and that of her \u2018Mummy.\u201d To be frank, I was ill-equipped to deal with it, much like Eleanor. And it wrecked me. At thirty years-old, Eleanor Oliphant is alone in this world. She always has been, actually. In and out of foster care since she was a little girl, she has never been touched by anyone in a loving way and doesn\u2019t even know what that would feel like, but that\u2019s ok. All of her physical needs are met, you see and she has never had any emotional needs. Seeing as she doesn\u2019t have any friends, Eleanor is quiet and socially awkward. Everyone thinks she is fairly strange, if you must to know. Not that she minds since people\u2019s behavior makes absolutely no sense to her. She is good at being alone and she does not feel sorry for herself. Not even when \u2018Mummy\u2019 calls and viciously tells her daughter off and berates her for being being \u201cnaughty.\u201d Eleanor, however wears a coat of armor and does her best to let her mother\u2019s words bounce off of her. Eleanor has no aspirations though she has done accounting at an office for the last 9 years. Every day of her life is the same and she would be nothing without routine. One night, all of that changes rather abruptly. After work, she and a coworker named Raymond whom she just met and who happens to be leaving the office at the same time as her, find themselves in the exact right place at the right time. Both Eleanor and Raymond see a man (named Samuel), go down on the sidewalk and they go have a look see and discover that he needs an ambulance. This incident ends up tying the three together and becomes one of the most significant in Eleanor Oliphant\u2019s life. It forges a bond of friendship between them, which is something Eleanor has never experienced before in all her thirty years. During this time, Eleanor also ends up finding him. The man she has been waiting for all of her life. The man she is meant to be with. Now she just has to get him to notice her. In trying to do so, Eleanor grows bolder and more confident. She also learns to lean on and open herself up to her new friends.Throughout the book, Eleanor slowly experiences a metamorphosis, one that often makes you smile, laugh and of course, cry. She is damaged and quirky but oh so special. I loved her dearly. For more reasons than one. I identified with Eleanor Oliphant you see, and for that, I was unprepared. I did say that this book wrecked me right?! I get why Eleanor is Completely Fine. She had no choice. Unfortunately, Eleanor\u2019s \u2018Mummy\u2019 is someone I recognized fairly well. When I heard her voice (in a Scottish accent) on the audiobook, and the way she spoke to her daughter, my chest got tight and my throat closed up and I sobbed. Unlike Eleanor's \u201cMummy\u201d however, mine happens to be British instead of Scottish - though the accents are close, thus I therefore guess that listening to the audiobook had an even more profound effect on me. I\u2019ve had similar conversations, in case it wasn\u2019t obvious and I felt Eleanor\u2019s pain more deeply as it related to her \u2018Mummy\u2019, for at certain times in my life, it mirrored my own. All that aside however, Eleanor does not go quietly into the dark goodnight (and neither did I, for what it\u2019s worth). Though it affected me greatly, \u201cEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine\u201d is without a doubt one of the most incredible, profound, and beautifully well written novels I have absorbed in ages. It wrecked me in the best and worst ways possible. In case it\u2019s not obvious, it will stay with me for a long time. I think I came across it on purpose as both Eleanor Oliphant and I needed something from it and I think we were both lucky enough to receive it.

She's doing real well, thank you very much. Except maybe she isn't. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine caught me completely unawares. I'll be honest - I picked it up because it got some buzz and the author is British, but it actually turned out to be one of those perfectly-balanced sad/funny books. Maybe like some combination of The Rosie Project, Me Before You, Finding Audrey and A Man Called Ove. It takes a serious, traumatic issue and weaves it into a warm, funny and, yes, sometimes sad tale.I read a lot of books and many characters come and go. Some are well-developed and interesting, others less so. But on a rare occasion I find one of those truly memorable characters that will stay with me a long time. Eleanor is one of them. She is socially clueless in a way that puts my teen self to shame. She is literal to a degree that everyone finds odd. It's painful to witness and yet so, so endearing.I think I like this book so much because it is actually really sad, but never manipulative. On a surface level, it's a very funny novel about a socially-inept twenty-nine year-old woman. Her attempts to become \"normal\" and integrate into society by having manicures and waxes are sources of hilarity. But it is very sad. It's sad when we see her coworkers talking about her, but Eleanor is oblivious to their scorn. It's sad how alone in life she is. It's sad when she \"falls in love\" with an idea of a person.It's not a romantic book and I'm glad. There are hints that the central relationship will eventually develop into romance, but this is really a book about Eleanor. I am thankful that the author didn't cure Eleanor and lead her out of the darkness by having her fall in love. Being happy and achieving greater self-worth should, in my opinion, never be linked to romance.I really enjoyed it. It's great to find a book so packed full of emotion without seeming overly-sentimental.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube.", "Need a good read for a bad day?

Would I recommend reading it right this second? Depends on if you want to lay awake at 2AM thinking about how few people you've spoken to in person for the past nine months...- I\u2019m glad there was an emphasis placed on friendship between Eleanor and Raymond, because I was afraid up until the very last second that the author was going to throw in a completely unnecessary romance and ruin their whole thing.- I'm really all for stories where people get out of their comfort zones & try new things. That's a pretty minor part of everything that happens, but it was fun to read about nonetheless.- I have some mixed feelings about the way the book shifts tone throughout. The first 35% (or so) operates as a lighthearted, \u201cquirky\u201d contemporary before hurtling headfirst into the heavy shit. There were some elements of Eleanor\u2019s past trauma & present mental health that I felt weren\u2019t handled carefully (it sometimes seemed that Gail Honeyman just wanted to pile it on her character without adequately figuring how to conclude everything correctly, so she just dropped talking about some of the stuff that she didn\u2019t want to deal with writing) (oh also, cw: depression, alcoholism, ptsd, murder of a child, emotional/physical abuse, rape, attempted suicide)- I\u2019m irked by the fact that this author had Eleanor become more likeable (partially) through her appearance. It\u2019s literally like one giant rom-com makeover scene where the uncool nerd takes her glasses off, only for people to realize she\u2019s been pretty the whole time! There\u2019s a difference, to me, between self-care and how Eleanor\u2019s moves towards looking more conventionally attractive make people *suddenly* care for her company.In the end, this book had some heart and was weirdly comforting to read, despite my above issues.

Eleanor is the poster girl for loneliness and social isolation caused by having a frightful childhood resulting in a truly traumatic event (no spoiler : a house fire). Eleanor is 30 and has zero friends, less than zero family, a poorly paid job, doesn\u2019t speak to her co-workers, doesn\u2019t even have a cat or a dog or a budgie or a little worm as a pet.

It\u2019s not easy to find these days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not dedication, \u201c I said. \u201cI simply have a very robust constitution and no one to go on holiday with.\u201dYes, it\u2019s quite funny, but now, come on Gail Honeyman, no one is as loopy or brusque or unaware as that. Even Eleanor would know her remark was inappropriate, embarrassing, too much information \u2013 even if she meant it to be funny, which she didn\u2019t, because, like any Vulcan, she has no sense of humour. She is the source of the humour but never understands why anyone is laughing. It did occur to me that Eleanor was somewhere on the autism spectrum but that is never alluded to in the novel. Has Gail Honeyman created an Asperger Syndrome character without realising it or is she just playing Eleanor for some pretty easy laughs? As well as not knowing how real people talk to each other, Eleanor has no knowledge of popular culture. She has not heard of Laurel and Hardy (\u201cthe film was about a fat, clever man and a thin, stupid man who\u2019d joined the Foreign Legion. They were patently unsuited to it\u201d) ; and yet she namedrops J D Salinger and the Unabomber. She doesn\u2019t know what parking meters are :\u201cI\u2019ll need to run, Eleanor \u2013 the car\u2019s on the meter and you know what those wardens are like if you go a minute over.\u201dI had absolutely no idea what she was talking about but I let it pass.As you see there are some nice comedy moments. Here\u2019s another favourite : we all know about product placement on tv and in movies. How about reverse-product placement? This is where you aggressively badmouth a specific item quite gratuitously. Eleanor is observing someone else\u2019s basket of purchases in a supermarket :Eggs, bacon, orange juice and Nurofen tablets. I had to stop myself from leaning forward and explaining that he was wasting his money \u2013 this branded non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was in fact ibuprofen 200 mg, the generic version of which was readily available for sale at perhaps one-quarter of the price. For 70% of the time this novel is gentle comedy, of the sort you can find in sitcoms like Not Going Out or The Vicar of Dibley if the Vicar had a brain injury. But then begins the process of Eleanor thawing out and assuming a more \u201cnormal\u201d shape. The great thing about this novel now emerges. This novel believes in ordinary human kindness as the thing which can save us, and not romantic love, and that is a great message which is very rarely heard. But the normalising of Eleanor has some disturbing aspects. Quite often it\u2019s like a rerun of Georgy Girl, the folksy hit by The Seekers from 1966.  Hey there, Georgy girl Swingin' down the street so fancy-free Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there - inside you Hey there, Georgy girl Look at all the boyfriends you don\u2019t get Never had a real one yet, just look at the clothes you wear You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy Just shed those dowdy feathers and fly - a little bitAnd the dowdy feathers are indeed shed \u2013 cue humorous sketches involving bikini waxes, new hairdos and new clothes. \u201cBut Miss Oliphant\u2026 you\u2019re beautiful!\u201d is almost said by at least two characters. Well. I absolutely don\u2019t want to kick this novel down the cellar steps and have it look back up at me all begrimed with cobwebs and sing \"Where is Love?\" through big blobby tears. I love the gospel of ordinary human kindness here, even though it\u2019s wrapped up in some fairly disgraceful looksism and evangelical therapyspeak towards the end. I argued myself up down and sideways about Eleanor Oliphant and finally copped out with a rueful three stars. This is a nice novel.

I hope.It\u2019s actually a happenstance run-in with one of her coworkers and the ensuing friendship that inspires the most change in Eleanor\u2014her outlook on life and interactions with people. It\u2019s comical that Raymond doesn\u2019t seem fazed by Eleanor\u2019s stunted social skills. In fact, his mellow attitude and companionship go a long way to smooth her edges.When things don\u2019t go to plan, Eleanor is forced to stare down her truth.

Obviously these are colorful characters to write about\u2014it seems as if the literary world is full of them.But the more time I spent with Eleanor Oliphant, I realized that her behavior was more the result of circumstance than will, nurture if you will, rather than nature. And then I thought about how boring the world might be if everyone acted the way they were expected to, said the right things, and never expressed their true feelings. (Lord knows if I couldn't roll my eyes, my head might explode.)Eleanor lives by her routines. She eats the same meals, wears the same clothes, has her weekly chat with Mummy, and has her weekend rituals, which include frozen pizza and enough vodka to keep her pleasantly drunk all weekend. For the most part, she eschews interactions with her coworkers, whom she mostly thinks are daft and lazy. They make fun of her both behind her back and in front of her, and she doesn't really care.\"I do not light up a room when I walk into it. No one longs to see me or hear my voice. I do not feel sorry for myself, not in the least. These are simply statements of fact.\"Two things happen which throw her routines off-kilter. First, while attending a concert with a coworker, she spots a handsome musician and is quickly smitten. She has decided that he is the one for her, and starts to ready herself for their first encounter, during which she knows he'll sweep her off her feet and they'll live happily ever after. She needs a makeover and new clothes, and she starts doing research on her soon-to-be-beloved.Meanwhile, one afternoon she and Raymond, the IT guy from her office, whom she considers poorly groomed and a bit bumbling, save the life of an elderly man who falls in front of them. Saving Sammy's life suddenly gives Eleanor two unexpected relationships, friendships, that she has never had before. She still acts the way she believes to be appropriate, and says things that most wouldn't, but she begins liking the feeling of belonging, of companionship, which she never realized she wanted.\"Some people, weak people, fear solitude. What they fail to understand is that there's something very liberating about it, once you realize that you don't need anyone, you can take care of yourself. That's the thing: it's best just to take care of yourself. You can't protect other people, however hard you try. You try, and you fail, and your world collapses around you, burns down to ashes.\"Eleanor's social awkwardness, her lack of a filter, her inability to grasp exactly how people expect her to behave, actually hides a great deal of secret pain, pain and memories even she has hidden. And when she is forced to start recognizing just what a burden she has carried for so much of her life, and who was responsible, it threatens to break her. Suddenly she realizes she may need to do something she never has\u2014depend on others, and reveal things about herself she's always kept hidden, in order to move forward. If she wants to.Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine is really a special book. Even if some of Eleanor's behaviors are similar to other quirky characters you might have seen, she is totally unique, and while off-putting, just absolutely wonderful. You both marvel and are saddened by the burdens she has carried, and how she copes with them. I found myself becoming protective of her, worrying there would come an instant where someone made a total fool out of her (with her own help, of course).Honeyman really did a terrific job with Eleanor. Even as she began letting down her guard, Honeyman kept her character consistent, but never let her become unsympathetic. While this is certainly Eleanor's story, I liked the other characters as well, although they certainly didn't get as much attention. I thought the ending was a little too pat for my taste, but I really enjoyed this overall, and don't think I'll be forgetting Eleanor or her story anytime soon.God bless the people who challenge our notions of \"appropriate\" and \"normal,\" because they are what keeps our world interesting!.", "Eleanor Oliphant lives a fairly secluded life due to her lack of social graces and crippling self esteem and anxiety issues.

As things change for Eleanor she is forced to confront the past and confront the real reason for her recent desire for more. I really enjoyed this, oh man Eleanor is so quirky and endearing. Her inner monologue was excellent and I could really relate to her. I had an especially visceral reaction when (view spoiler)[ she is at the concert and suddenly feels disgusted with herself when she realizes she's been projecting this whole time and created a fantasy in her head and just feels foolish  (hide spoiler)] because come on who hasn't had a moment like that. I've had my fair share of moments when I try really hard and then just feel embarrassed and stupid about everything I've done. Eleanor just felt so real and human. The only thing that annoyed me was the ending when (view spoiler)[ we find out her mother isn't alive she was imagining it  (hide spoiler)] because it felt unnecessary and I didn't think we needed a plot twist like it kind of ruined all her conversations with her mom for me a little bit.

Here I thought I was going to be reading a story about a lovable curmudgeon whose heart slowly thaws from the sweet people around her. But that's not Eleanor. Instead, she's mean, rude, and petty. In fact, she's dreadful in all the ways that would make a character unlikable. And since the story is written from her perspective, it was really hard to enjoy it.We spend so much time in her head as she passes judgement on every single person crossing her way, commenting on their fashion styles, their looks, how they choose to spend their time, and so much more. She's also disparaging when people attempt to make conversations with her, but then she laments how she has no contact with anyone. She doesn't tip and is quick to blame others when she doesn't get the service she wants, even when she's the one who misunderstands.She talks like she's the queen of holier-than-thou, with big words and obscure references. I understand she's well-read, but where could she possibly have picked up such a pompous style of conversation? And yet she doesn't understand the meaning of \"pulled a late night\" or how much to tip. I find it hard to believe that she hasn't come across that information in her readings, but she has come across Latin phrases and obscure references.And herein lies the crux of the issue: Eleanor doesn't ring true to me as a person. She knows both a lot and very little about the same subject. When she talks about emotions and loneliness, she's surprisingly insightful, yet she doesn't realize that they apply to her. She judges alcoholics harshly, but doesn't make the connection to her own alcohol issue. She works in finance, but doesn't know the difference between laptops, desktops, and tablets. She falls for a guy based entirely on his looks, yet goes on about how she hopes he will love her for who she is. This book does contain some touching and uplifting passages, mostly around Sammy, Raymond, and his mother. These supporting characters warm up their scenes with their sweetness and kind regard for Eleanor. And I found the mysteries around what happened to Eleanor during her younger years to be interesting, although I did see the smallish twist coming.Since this story completely revolves around Eleanor, finding her character to be frustrating really hampered my ability to enjoy it. However, my experience is an outlier and so many others loved the character and the book, so please don't rule it out just based on my experience..", "What an absolutely fantastic character Eleanor is, a character that grew on me the more I read.

Until a crush with a musician and an IT guy named Raymond derails her schedule and her life.Why did I give this five stars? It is a first book, with nary a misstep, an assured book with amazing writing and character development. Plus it is difficult to take a book with so few characters, and not only make it interesting enough to keep the reader immersed, but to let us see the way Eleanor changes and grows throughout the story. There is much humor, there is also sadness and I came to embrace this character in all her strangeness, loved when she figured things out and came to terms with her past. There are a few places where the author could have gone overboard on sweetness but she kept true to the character of Eleanor and just managed to stay on the border, without crossing over. This is a book I will remember, it was that good and meaningful, in my opinion. Looking forward to great things from this new author, she is a true talent.

She doesn't have filters when it comes to saying what she's thinking. Yet....Eleanor Oliphant has a uniqueness that only she can claim. Eleanor goes to the same office job - M-F 8:30 to 5:30 every day. She works as a finance clerk. She takes an hour lunch break. We know her weekday supper routines and her weekend menu. Weekends are frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. Eleanor's life changes after she meets Raymond, a co-worker IT guy. His sloppy -unkempt style doesn't bother Eleanor-she never had any friends to begin with and she wasn't a fashion queen herself. Raymond and Eleanor help a man, Sammy, who took a fall -- and the three of them become allies for each other. They begin to unleash from their individual isolated livesand bond together in a heartwarming friendship. This story really makes you realize how valuable one friend can be. Eleanor had been stuck in ways she didn't even have the eyes to see - let alone do anything about it.But it's Raymond -his goodness- that ultimately helps Eleanor mend her broken heart....by helping her face areas of her painful childhood she has avoided. The story is broken down into three sections:. Good DaysBad Days Better Days Tender- touching - and plenty of heart. This is another book that I read last year\u2026 The book was given to me last summer. I wrote a review but I have no idea where it is. I do remember enjoying it!! I still have the book in my house. I'm walking now, I can research the review or look through the book later but it was quirky and enjoyable.......NEVER FOUND IT THROUGH GR's .... but I had a copy!.", "I dare you not to think Elephant when you hear this title.

Maybe it's sort of like subliminal advertising, except the author isn't trying to sell us elephants. Eleanor Oliphant. Elephant elephant elephant!I can get all analytical and talk about how Eleanor--the fact that half of her face is badly scarred and that no one knows (or dares to ask) how she got that way\u2014is the elephant in the room. (In fact, the author makes a pun once, referring to an Oliphant in the room.) And like an elephant, Eleanor Oliphant indeed fills the room, even though she would prefer that no one see her, that everyone leave her alone. The world is too scary to her and she is the poster child for anti-social behavior. In one venture she is completely delusional--she thinks her crush on a famous person will lead to marriage. She is a riot, but she has no idea she is. It's also true that she's sad and feels isolated and unlovable. Formal, literal, awkward, and very very funny in her skewed world view, are also part of her package. Routines, crossword puzzles, and vodka are her mainstays. I usually like oddball characters; Eleanor is definitely one of my favorites. Her character is so well-drawn, I'll remember her I'm sure.This book sure isn't all laughs and all light by any means. This is also a dark book. Something awful happened to Eleanor when she was a kid, and throughout the book we get hints about what it is. The ending had a very clever surprise that made me shake my head in wonder. I loved it. The middle of the book dragged a little for me, which made me call it a 4-star read at first. (I just had to change my rating to 5 stars, though--the book is just too damn good and I can't get Eleanor out of my head.) Eleanor has a hilarious adventure in a salon early on (one I just have to reread), and there's a lot of other funny energy. Absurd situations described in language that hopped, gave me the feeling that I was on an amusement ride. The author seemed \u201con\u201d, jazzed up, and I couldn\u2019t get off the ride even if I wanted to. Of course, I wanted the book to keep up that level of hilarity, and it didn't. Still, Eleanor was relentlessly fascinating, both her public, regular side (that\u2019s a poor choice of words because there is nothing regular about Eleanor) and her private, dark side. I recommend this book wholeheartedly. I'm shocked that this is a debut--it's so well-written, and the lovable, weird heroine is so so vivid. I'll be in line for the author's next book, although this book will be a hard act to follow..", "Eleanor Oliphant is a thirty year old accounts receivable clerk who has a humdrum existence.

What the author also does so well is relate to the reader (this is what Stephan King does so well, his trademark that allows him to draw readers from across all genres), the reader can relate to similar instances where he/she has witnessed someone socially challenged trying to navigate a difficult world. I was stunned at the craft level, how the author could make me laugh at comments or situations that were both sad and at the same time humorous. In A Man Called Ov the author was able to do something similar.In the story, Raymond\u2019s character is a peach of a guy the way he carries his love of Eleanor and for the way he keeps coming back time and again after he\u2019s been socially dismissed. The story Arc centers around Eleanor\u2019s love for a rock star who has no idea she even exists.

She is brilliant, yet socially awkward. At the age of 10 she experienced a trauma that she never received any help with to sort through it. So, she repressed her memories and more importantly, she repressed her emotions. By the age of 30, she was so good at repression that it completely froze parts of her being and the underlying, unacknowledged fear of any of her repressions getting out were the root cause of her lack of social skills.When dealing with intellectual matters, she is formidable; her vocabulary and the facts at her fingertips are beyond many people\u2019s comprehension. Yet even as she grew and matured, some parts of her remained in the stunted, closed-in world of her 10-year-old self.Despite everything she had experienced, with both physical scars and those on her psyche, not once does Eleanor feel self-pity or get caught up in, \u201cI am a victim\u201d. She simply does not see herself that way and it is one of the reasons I admire her as a character to be honoured and respected.At her workplace, she meets the new IT guy Raymond, and her critique of him is definitely offhand and dismissive. Although they do eventually become friends, Eleanor has her sights set on someone else \u2013 far more glamourous, exciting, and sophisticated.When her world takes a nose dive, she is wise enough to know it is because of her own poor decisions based on influences from her past, and she takes brave measures to turn her life around with help from her friend Raymond. Her long and slow recovery is a testament to the human soul\u2019s willingness to strive and thrive against all odds.I found this book to be a compelling read, funny in places, deadly serious in other places, but always, always buoyed by Eleanor\u2019s determination and resilience. It was rewarding to watch her friendship with Raymond grow, and his support of her is inspiring.I loved this book; it is yet another amazing debut novel by an author I hope to read more of in the future. This one is going straight to my Favourites shelf, and I know that if ever I need inspiration, all I need do is think about Eleanor Oliphant!.", "4.5 stars!

You can sense something traumatic has happened, but you're unsure, because Eleanor is unsure. Slowly, it is uncovered, and thus this is the journey we follow.In between all of that, we look at her life. We're inside her mind and perceive her world the way that she sees it, with humorous and witty observations about pretty much everything that catches her eye. You laugh, but also feel this sense of sadness for her, because she's alone most of the time. But she's fine, or so she thinks. The story looks at the concept of loneliness extremely well. It hurts to read, but the reality of the matter is, loneliness is not healthy as we all know. This is different to solitude, but the need to connect with another human being is strong and innate in this book, and if not met, can cause damage to ones psyche. It was painful to follow Eleanor on this realisation that she was alone. Has been for most of her life. So how does she fix this? How does she battle the demons that've been buried for so long?This book is a beautifully, written journey I became fixated on. There's pain, but growth and absolute attachment to Eleanor.

If we look around and see so many interacting personally with their cell phones rather than one another, and think about the hordes of people sitting at home in front of the television watching mindless shows or playing video games, and those of us\u2026 ahem, sitting at our computers alone but attempting to engage with others online \u2013 I am nearly convinced that loneliness could very well be a disease of this technologically advanced century. Eleanor Oliphant certainly knows something about loneliness. In fact, it was this issue that really stood out for me the most in this novel. I mean, yes, there are a number of other problems to reflect on here as well \u2013 alcoholism, mental abuse, and physical abuse for starters. And then it seems we could also touch on Asperger\u2019s. In fact, I think you could open up a copy of a DSM-5 if you had one handy (I didn\u2019t) and slap quite a few official diagnoses under Eleanor\u2019s name. However, I really don\u2019t mean to make light of any of Eleanor\u2019s problems because even just one of these would be enough to make me feel for this quirky and solitary soul. Initially, Eleanor is a bit unlikeable\u2026 judgmental, aloof, and not always very nice \u2013 she just might tell you exactly what she thinks. She is also quite funny\u2026 not purposefully, of course, but I dare you not to laugh about some of her observations! In the very least, you may nod your head. \"I do feel that tube tops are best suited to the under twenty-fives, if, indeed, they are suited to anyone.\" And then she little by little grows on you as you learn her story and you not only sympathize with her, you might actually find yourself caring for her and cheering her on.  There are a number of excellent reviews out there so I won\u2019t dwell more on Eleanor\u2019s personal history or the plot here. The balance seems to be overwhelmingly tipped in favor of this book, but there are some fantastic reviews that also sit on the other side of the scale and are well worth their weight. There were some things that bugged me while reading this - a number of inconsistencies in Eleanor\u2019s character, for example. She would say one thing and then act in an opposing manner. An unbelievable love interest comes to mind immediately. And what about the vodka binge drinking? \"Vodka is, for me, merely a household necessity, like a loaf of bread or a packet of tea.\" Does one quit this without a recovery process? Are there no withdrawal symptoms? Okay, enough said about that. However, despite several of these inconsistencies, I could not help being entirely charmed by this novel! I seriously adored Raymond! I like to think that there really is that nice guy (or gal) out there that will make a difference in someone\u2019s life \u2013 a person who doesn\u2019t necessarily shine when you first glance at him or her, but one with that unassuming presence whose friendship is truly priceless. My personal enjoyment of the book as well as the importance of bringing the issue of loneliness into the forefront are what tipped the scale in the right direction for me.\"There\u2019s no shame, you know, no shame at all in being\u2026 depressed, or having a mental illness or whatever...\".", "I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about \u201cEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, \u201c but I must admit I was somewhat reluctant to read it.

Does it really matter whether the civil war occurs in South Africa during Apartheid time? Dehumanization knows of no races, no nationalities, no dogmas, and Michael\u2019s insignificant life is diluted in the ocean of human misery.Michael K abandons himself to starvation surrounded by sterile nature in a desperate attempt to step out of the Kafkaesque labyrinth of mankind and to return to origins, to reconnect with the earth that nurtures his pumpkin seeds and his gardener soul. The silver moonbeams, the sight of every morning and the shadow of the mountain shape his atemporal existence in an alien world where man and land become one. Michael K knows he is nothing. He doesn\u2019t want to die because his life is not even worth telling but ironically he lives in dying more intensely than he does in living. He refutes the absurdity of an imposed system based on bigoted domination and ruthless abuse and sets for the path of self-determination through passive resistance. With isolation comes spiritual transformation and echoing one of the most famous bugs in the history of literature, Michael K metamorphoses into a \u201csmaller, harder and drier\u201d lethargic creature whose consciousness appears more and more fragmented each passing day.Michael K is captured and sent to a \u201crehabilitation\u201d camp. His mind obeys because his rebellion wouldn\u2019t make a difference but his body acts of his own accord, refusing to be poisoned by food that will revive his emaciated frame into a sellable piece of meat ready to be exploited, mistreated and deprived of identity. The initial bafflement gives way to an escalating distress that reaches its pinnacle coinciding with a narrative shift in the second movement of the novella. The omniscient Michael K disappears and a first person narrator embodied in one of the doctors of the labour camp takes his place and starts contemplating Michael\u2019s motives for his stubborn refusal to eat, making the new narrator reflect on his inculcated beliefs and his reasons to endorse war. Why does he feel an irrepressible urge to save this weird man? What is the story hidden behind his patient\u2019s silence? What is he fighting for? The doctor\u2019s persistent pondering seeps over and into the reader\u2019s thirst for answers and his voice takes a universal quality transcending fiction, character and plotline.Doctor, reader, the same Coetzee or even the whole humanity incarnate the metaphorical voice-over dwelling on the story of a man without history who understands nothing about wars, political ideologies, dogmatic belief, races, life, death, love or even pain but whose apparent indifference bears a terrifying consistency and a mystical aura reminiscent of Melville\u2019s scrivener Bartleby and his motto \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d. Pacifist revolutionary? Dauntless freethinker? Coetzee doesn\u2019t supply answers and his slippery hero dissolves into the reeking darkness of a recondite barrow in the uterus of a depraved civilization where he waits in eternal stand-by, oblivious to past or future, to be reborn in a shocking and final third movement where \u201cthe obscurest of the obscure becomes a prodigy\u201d.

Ask me to judge a book dissecting the greater human quandary with keen insight but in stilted prose, and my reaction will possibly be more or less the same. But give me a story capable of dismantling all the divides of race, culture, political/religious indoctrination, time and space, encompassing all the inner contradictions of our existence into a compelling commentary on human follies that elicits a very visceral, emotional response, and my being won over is practically guaranteed.Reading Michael K's tale took me on one such heart-breaking, metaphorical journey, at the culmination of which I realized that pitying the innocence of Michael Ks of the world who are repeatedly squashed like bugs under the bootsoles of the 'system' is but a foolish thing to do. Instead, I felt pity for the ones who are incapable of recognizing true misery when they see it, the ones who fail to identify the root cause of all human conflict and its futility, who pride themselves on their achievements which are, sometimes, nothing but grave mistakes in the greater scheme of things.In spite of being born with genetic deformities and other crucial handicaps like the absence of a privileged background, Michael K is a fortunate being in my eyes. Someone who doesn't baulk at staring truth right in the eye, a venerable hero stranded in the midst of cowards. He can summon the moral strength to shun the comforts of life, deprived of which each one of us are bound to wither away and die the pathetic death of an unwatered plant. He can seek refuge in the heart of the inhabitable mountains, combat starvation by feasting on insects and the cherished pumpkins he cultivates with the tender care of a mother. He is brave enough to eschew the path prescribed by the ones positioned on the top most echelons of the social hierarchy. He doesn't know which side to choose during a war. So he chooses life over death, physical suffering over psychological enslavement, creation over destruction. Simply put, he deserts the company of men to embrace humanity.\"You are precious, Michaels in your way; you are the last of your kind, a creature left over from an earlier age, like the coelacanth or the last man to speak Yaqui. We have all tumbled over the lip into the cauldron of history: only you, following your idiot light, biding your time in an orphanage, evading the peace and the war, skulking in the open where no one dreamed of looking, have managed to live in the old way, drifting through time, observing the seasons no more trying to change the course of history than a grain of sand does. We ought to value you and celebrate you, we ought to put your clothes and your packet of pumpkin seeds too, with a label; there ought to be a plague nailed to the racetrack wall commemorating your stay here.\"Despite being considered 'messed up in the head', he understands the one thing that others are too afraid or too ignorant to acknowledge. That laying the groundwork for a future way of life through ruthless violence blunts the human intellect to the point where one is only aroused by the urge to draw blood, inflict fatal injury and the application of reason loses its appeal.Michael doesn't understand what a war is, so he struggles to flee the myriad horrors of it, clinging to the last shred of his dignity and his self-made definitions of right and wrong. As everything falls apart in the cities, in the labour camps, swallowed up by the chaos brought forth during war, Michael busies himself with creating and rebuilding life in the countryside.Thus, Michael is nothing but a representation of that slumbering voice of reason within each one of us, the voice of the dissenter, the voice of the one putting up a passive but stubborn resistance against the absurd, inhumane demands of society at large. And that is precisely the reason why this world needs more silent revolutionaries like him. P.S.:- My only grouse with Coetzee is his pedagogical compulsion to launch into a lengthy discourse, expounding on hidden meanings, instead of having faith in the perceptive reader to grasp underlying implications. That caused me to take away that 1 star which I had no intention of taking away otherwise..", "Is life a journey?

However, overall, I still think the other two were the better novels, as its simple minded protagonist here felt more like a cloddish plot device than a real man. I really couldn't work him out. Just how much of a dullard was he?Coetzee is persistently reminding the reader just how much of a borderline simpleton Michael K actually is, and how little he can make sense of the world, and yet, he seems able to easily outwit those who want to capture him, knows irrigation systems, growing crops and building shelters like the back of his hand, talks forcefully, and asks many searching questions.We first meet him when things appear relatively normal, until in a discomfiting way, Coetzee describes a jeep knocking a youth off a road, a crowd gathering, curfew sirens ignored, a man firing a revolver from a nearby building and the arrival of the military. Things are getting very dangerous in this alternate South Africa. Michael K decides he and his mother simply cannot stay where they are, especially as she is sick and pining for her rural birthplace, so using a trolley he wheels her away and they heads for the hills. But out on the road things aren't any better, to Michael K at the start of this journey, brutality and danger and stiffness of limb and rain seem all the same; tyranny feels as natural an ordeal as the bleak harshness of the road. His mother deteriorates so piteously that Michael must surrender her to a hospital, were he is shunted aside, until he receives the worst possible news. And here begins the parable of Michael K's freedom and resourcefulness; here begins Michael K's brief life of bliss. He is a sort of Robinson Crusoe meets Huckleberry Finn - he is the lord of his own life. Continuing to an abandoned farm where he begins to cut his remaining ties with the world, he hides away in a self-made dugout, living off little more than water, warm daylight, a few gathered bugs, and some crops. Every so often Michael's quiet existence is disrupted by the war he feels he has no part in, but is constantly told he is part of it whether he likes it or not. He finds himself in and out of prison camps, forced to work, and to answer questions he fails to understand, or simply chooses not to. He defies his captors by rejecting the food they give him, he starts to waste away.By switching voice later on, the text cleverly evades authority, as we get the first-person notes of the prison-camp doctor who ministers to the starving prisoner. This I thought was a smart move, seeing through the eyes of someone else, and what they make of this oddity of man.I found some of the scenes throughout deeply moving, and also the ending to be one of those that lingers around in your head for a good while, and despite the book being under 200 pages it felt longer to me. Coetzee is a writer of clarifying inventiveness and translucent conviction, and here get we get a vivid and eloquent tale. His subdued yet urgent lament is for the sadness of a South Africa that has made dependents, parasites, and prisoners of its own children, black or white. Having read three of his novels now, it becomes more clear to me why he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature..", "During a civil war in South Africa, Michael K., a simple man born with a harelip, tries to get help for his sick mother; then, after she dies, he attempts to take her ashes to the farm where she grew up.There\u2019s something powerful yet elusive about this short novel by Nobel laureate J.M.

Race, interestingly enough, is barely mentioned; soldiers prowl the land, asking for identification papers; at one point Michael finds himself working in a labour camp. But by keeping the details about the political situation vague, Coetzee creates a timeless allegory about suffering and endurance. Michael just wants to live, grow his own food (he\u2019s got some gardening skills) and get by. Can he do that in this world?The prose is at times hypnotic in its understated simplicity: uncluttered and clear, devoid of sentimentality.Some readers have found the introduction and perspective of another character late in the book to be jarring, but I felt it added an additional layer of complexity to this enigmatic and haunting novel about living with dignity, freedom and a sense of purpose..", "~ This review dedicated to 'Ya Boy.'

I'ma sip this, you do the rest. ~ The Community of Misery 'Misery loves company.' I've always kind of really hated that expression because (rightly or not) I've usually deciphered the unsettling subtext whenever it's employed: i.e., that people -- experiencing misfortunes or enduring profound unhappiness -- prefer that others are likewise afflicted. When I was younger, for instance, my father, a nouveau riche who absurdly prided himself on the mythologized 'poverty' of his youth, was fond of the saying, 'I used to be sad because I had no shoes, but then I met a man who had no feet.' As a grossly insensitive (that is to say, normal) child, the idea of a footless man was greatly humorous to me, so the moral was lost. I was too busy imagining a sort of idiot-manchild waddling around as if on rounded-off stilts to bother thinking about the relativism of misery. But now, as a highly actualized, compassionate man (quit laughing, you fucker), when I think of these sayings, which seem to pit our own misery in a competition with those of others, I find them disturbingly utilitarian or, worse, sadistic. In considering Coetzee's exceptionally grim novel Life and Times of Michael K, I am leery of invoking anything that even vaguely stinks of the M.L.C. (Misery loves company) ethos, but at the risk of still calling to mind these allusions, I'd prefer to speak of a community of misery. Now you Mary Poppins types (yeah, the ones who live in a debilitating state of denial regarding their material and existential plight) will heckle, jump up on tables, maybe burst into song. Who knows? But it is fundamentally wrong and, ergo, stupid to deny that misery is a fundamental part of life. It is. You may call 'misery' by another name, a kinder, gentler, more palatable name; instead of misery, for instance, perhaps you 'encounter challenges' or 'suffer setbacks.' At any rate, let's not fret over semantics, and let's concede that shit happens. Holy shit, does shit ever happen. And it happens more to some people than to other people. And -- perhaps even more interestingly -- some people are better equipped (psychologically, biologically?) to cope with shit than other people are. The latter category of people may, pejoratively, be referred to as 'weak,' but in many cases, where unhappiness appears organic, this is akin to saying that the lazy bastard with the leukemia who lies around all the time is merely shiftless. But that's another discussion altogether. The community of misery I'm speaking of is the shared experience wherein we realize that our suffering is unexceptional. We discover this, for example, in our day-to-day interactions with So-and-So when he happens to say that he wakes up in the middle of the night sweating and shrieking with terror at the realization that his body is a mechanism, a 'factory' of life, if you will, and it operates precariously, without his supervision or awareness and is subject to unforeseeable defects and irregularities. That it, like a car or a toaster or a fax machine, may suddenly cease to operate correctly -- or to operate at all. And then you say, 'Omigod, I do the same thing! I wake up in the night shrieking about my strangely mechanistic biology!' The example is exaggerated, of course, but in the prior instance the Hypothetical You have entered a community of misery. You have discovered that you are unexceptional. Now usually, you understand, when we speak of something being 'unexceptional' it's generally considered either insulting or dismissive. But not so, misery! It's a horrible, horrible, horrible thing to be miserable, but it's exponentially worse to imagine that no one has any insight or empathetic entryway to our pain. We don't necessarily want to bring people down to our level, but we want to be understood and to not be alone. Occasionally, I want to be alone (to read, to masturbate, to scribble down my thoughts about this or that), but I don't believe -- and this is arrogant extrapolation -- that it is in the nature of the human condition to want to be alone in a greater existential sense. We desire community. Maybe not even a literal community, but a community of empathy and understanding. Michael K: Whipping Boy This book is about many things (some of them allegorical), but it is also about misery (or whatever we choose to call it in our own vocabularies). Michael K, the protagonist, suffers what most of us would call, in the vernacular, a pretty fucked-up life. He's impoverished. He's harelipped. He's a 'simpleton.' His mother is dying and must be cared for. He is mostly alone (in every sense of the term). He is abused seemingly by everyone around him. He is subject to misunderstanding and misinterpretation by those he meets. He is placed in a work camp. He hides in an underground burrow. His life is undirected; it's just bland endurance -- working toward nothing. When I read this book, I was reminded of some of the films of Lars Von Trier, such as Dogville and Dancer in the Dark, in which he introduces a noble and innocent but somewhat naive protagonist (Nicole Kidman and Bj\u00f6rk's characters, respectively) into a relentlessly cruel environment and lets the environment fuck her over in the worst way: either corrupting or destroying her. This is where the comparison ends, however, because while Von Trier is aggressive and manipulative, Coetzee's writing is humane and compassionate. Von Trier always seemed to me interested in the environment, in which the naif character is just a cipher, whereas Coetzee here also appears concerned with the 'victim' (a term I use with great reluctance because of how it is heavily weighted in society today). Allegorical intent aside, what Coetzee creates in Michael K is the impetus for a community of misery in which the readers are forced to identify with Michael K (and, later, with Michael K's environment, as the narrative shifts from third person to first person). Beyond the social critique of the novel, and at a more fundamental level, it addresses what it means to be alone -- completely, unfathomably alone in the world, in a way that is both moving and unsentimentalized. And this is surely a credit to Coetzee's talent. Consider the following sentence, in which a doctor at an internment camp speaks of Michael K: With Michaels [The doctor doesn't know his correct name.:] it always seemed to me that someone had scuffled together a handful of dust, spat on it, and patted it into the shape of a rudimentary man, making one or two mistakes (the mouth, and without a doubt the contents of the head), omitting one or two details (the sex), but coming up nevertheless in the end with a genuine little man of earth, the kind of little man one sees in peasant art emerging into the world from between the squat thighs of its mother-host with fingers ready hooked and back ready bent for a life of burrowing, a creature that spends its waking life stooped over the soil, that when at last its time comes digs its own grave and slips quietly in and draws the heavy earth over its head like a blanket and cracks a last smile and turns over and descends into sleep, home at last, while unnoticed as ever somewhere far away the grinding of the wheels of history continues.This is what great art does, of course. It's not rocket science to understand this, but what great writers do is something akin to rocket science -- inscrutable to laymen, seemingly mystically effective. They make us feel less alone and leave us with an augmented sense of the world we live in. So if you suffer in a very particular way, yes, you'll almost always find an uncanny affirmation in literature, music, painting, whatever... And by seeking to explicate and to understand that pain, art lessens it in some miraculous way. And that right there is one of the best reasons to read at all, I think. .", "My all-time favorite CoetzeeThere are protest novels that protrude a very clear message: an openly rejection of certain political systems, of injustice, discrimination or sheer terror.

And then you have a book like this one: very clearly rooted in a moralising story (against apartheid), but at the same time having a much more subtle and much broader message, exhibiting nothing less than a reflection on human condition. Coetzee does this through the main character, Micha\u00ebl K, a \"simple\" coloured man living in a town near the sea, a gardener working for the city council. In the background there is a civil war going on, regularly disrupting ordinary life. Michael is seen by others as a simpleton: he has been born with a hare lip, grew up in a youth institution, but is living now with his mother; this mother is getting sick, feels her end approaching and wants to return to her native ground.At the outset, you can recognize 4 literary references: the K. in the name of the main character is a clear reference to Kafka (the whole novel is drenched in the atmosphere of The Castle, the journey Michael makes, first with his mother and than on his own, is like an odyssey, in which Michael develops into an Everyman (like Peer Gynt or other variations), and the gardening motive clearly refers to Candide by Voltaire. But Coetzee has molded this rich material into a very original story. In the eyes of most of the other men Michael just is an idiot, he struggles with structures, regulations and human relations he does not understand, but he keeps on searching for a way to remain upright in life and in time (the experience of time also is a very important theme in this book). And without noticing it, this walking skeleton (as Michael has become in the end), develops into an icon of humanity! I can't say anything more about it without spoiling the story, but this novel really did captivate me. Coetzee certainly keeps on amazing me..", "***CONTAINS SPOILERS I.E.

You actually are allowed to see the world through another pair of eyes, observe, act, fail to act, feel, watch an entire life spool out with Technicolor vividness, rest firmly embedded in another for the length of the journey that is the book. That is something rare and wonderful that isn\u2019t often to be found, but I think it is close to the root of why certain readers trumpet certain authors and books with the fervor of one who has found The Grail or some other talisman of sacred import. The Life and Times of Michael K is my most recent experience where I closed a book at its end and felt I had been exposed completely to a real, living soul; where I felt the alchemy of a life lived thorough another take place. The book is the journey of one frail, physically malformed and mentally challenged man through the horrors of South African during the apartheid era. Michael K.\u2019s journey is one that begins in poverty and oppression, travels outwards into greater malignancies and terrors, and ends in a cruel stasis that might be synonymous with death. And yet\u2026this book never once struck me as being, depressed, morbid or overly sad. Through the strength of the writing I was so utterly with Michael most of the time, I could not stand outside dispassionately and think about what a terrible lot in life he had. And while the arc of Michael\u2019s journey is pitiful, one of mere subsistence for the greater part, there are also scenes of corresponding beauty that make you realize that even though Michael is a simpleton his connection to the land, to the earth, is something much more subtle and deep. Michael is a planter and a gardener and he finds what redemption he can from his hands delving into the red clay that is the body of South Africa and though he wouldn\u2019t know how to express it, there is sense of completeness and soul-solace he achieves there, that makes his life seem not wholly pitiful. By letting this half-starved , hair-lipped, street urchin be the recipient of these small instances of grace, Coetzee is really delivering a quite pass\u00e9 and subversive message: the most sordid lives might still seem to the ones experiencing them eminently worth living. And by letting Michael K. remain his plodding, dim and unaware self throughout this book, after numerous exposures to the brutal injustices of apartheid, war and exile, Coetzee has also delivered a stirring paean to the capacity of the individual, no matter how slight and flawed, to stand and prevail against anything. .", "This is an oddly compelling book about Michael K's journey from Cape Town to the place of his mother's childhood.

His decisions, no matter how inconsequential, stare at him, with a thousand questions in their eyes: that to eat, he can kill as well as produce; that to sleep, he can befriend day as well as night; that to comprehend, he can be mute as well as blind; that to survive, he can stuff as well as fast.He gains new perspectives, hopes and emotions while the origin of these new possessions continue to elude him. \"He awoke and squinted into the sun. Striking all the colours of the rainbow from his eyelashes, it filled the sky. I am like an ant that does not know where its hole is, he thought.\"Wading through captors, dodging policemen, escaping camps, at last, he falls into the hands of a genial Medical Officer who offers him guidance to start all over again. This Officer, although bears the brunt of a silent illegal suspect on his infirmary walls every day, confers him the benefit of doubt that every human deserves at least once in his lifetime. But Michael, by now, has learnt one of the biggest truths of life: it is far more worthwhile to die with intensity than to live without it. \"Not being iron was his greatest virtue.\"And so, Coetzee brings us down to that one night into whose stillness Michael walks finally, leaving behind the Slave Michaels that were lost to War and taking along the Free Michaels who might help him weather another War..", "In a word: devastating.This is Coetzee's signature novel and absolutely must be read.

They want to hear about all the cagesI have lived in, as if I were a budgie or awhite mouse or a monkey.In the days of apartheid in Capetown, South Africa, Coetzee gives us the story of Michael K, a bullied, downtrodden young man, who finds himself in the middle of a civil war he does not understand. His mother, who is dying, wants to return to her home in Prince Albert, and Michael rigs a cart and sets out to take her there, navigating his way through checkpoints and troops without the necessary papers. The mother dies en route, but that is just the beginning of Michael\u2019s struggles to survive in a society that makes no sense and will not allow anyone of Michael\u2019s ilk to live a simple or happy life.This is a story of isolation and loneliness. Michael becomes so much the secluded individual that he loses any desire or ability to co-exist with other people. The dangers are innumerable and unidentifiable. They come from both sides of the conflict, and no one is likely to be allowed to exist without choosing a side, but Michael is slow and naive, almost childlike, and he cannot even understand the dynamics of the conflict. Even the kind people he encounters befuddle him.As we begin to wonder if any individual has purpose in such a society, Michael also grapples with what his existence means, and Coetzee asks the question in captivating prose:Every grain of this earth will be washed clean by the rain, he told himself, and dried by the sun and scoured by the wind, before the seasons turn again. There will be not a grain left bearing my marks, just as my mother has now, after her season in the earth, been washed clean, blown about, and drawn up into the leaves of grass.A little more than halfway through the novel, Coetzee switches from the story we have been seeing exclusively in a third person voice from Michael\u2019s viewpoint, to a first person voice of a medical officer tasked with Michael\u2019s care in an internment camp. It seems to me that Coetzee wished to show us the human face of the opposition and demonstrate how difficult it would be to separate the players into strictly good and evil camps. This doctor is struggling, as well, with making sense of the system he serves. I wanted to say, \u201cyou ask why you are important Michaels. The answer is that you are not important. But that does not mean you are forgotten. No one is forgotten. Remember the sparrows. Five sparrows are sold for a farthing, and even they are not forgotten.\u201dI felt acutely the helplessness of Michael\u2019s situation and the attempt at self-preservation that takes the form of self-destruction. Michael rejects any interaction with society, either those who share his position or those who claim authority over him. While we are never told that Michael is black, or for that matter that the doctor or soldiers are white, we instinctively know this to be so. Michael\u2019s deformity that is the source of ridicule and derision, we are told, is his harelip that he has had from birth, but it is clear to me that we are meant to see that it is in truth his color, his class, his position in society that are his handicaps, and just like his physical deformity, they are not of his making or in his control. I found it interesting that more than one character in the novel asks if any attempt was ever made to correct Michael\u2019s deformity, and when told \u201cno\u201d, they each remark how easily the correction could have been made. Profound writing..", "God damn it, that was close!I had high hopes about this novel but I finished it feeling slightly disappointed.

It\u2019s been quite a few days since I finished this novel and the more I thought about it (at work, obviously, because that\u2019s where I seem to spend all my time nowadays) the more certain I am that the second part of the book is pointless and in my view outdated. A timeless classic this ain\u2019t! I really tried to find a purpose for it but I just couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know a lot about the apartheid besides the basics and what its name suggests but I have a feeling that the second part of the book was written with the objective of trying to create more empathy; not about the main character but the generality of the victims of the political system(?). Now, time to focus on the good, and there was so much to love about it. First of all the first class writing. Coetzee really doesn\u2019t waste a word (we\u2019re not talking about that second part now) and the imagery he creates using only a few words is outstanding. The way the story unfolds is remarkably quick and although this is a very short novel it never loses impact and Michael K \u201cjumps\u201d out of the pages. And you\u2019ll have to love him. You\u2019re going to. \u201cAlways, when he tried to explain himself to himself, there remained a gap, a hole, a darkness before which his understanding baulked, into which it was useless to pour words. The words were eaten up, the gap remained. His was always a story with a hole in it: a wrong story, always wrong.\u201dLike  Disgrace, this novel, with its violence, graphic imagery and his strong main character are going to haunt me for a long long time. Maybe forever if such a thing is possible..", "Obviously there're a lot of people out there who write much better than I do, and in this way I feel writing's similar to distance running.

I'm impressed by people who run faster than I can, just as I am by those who write better than me. These people are humbling, but they're also inspiring: reading good writing or watching good running makes me want to write better and run faster. It's healthy to see the thousands of names before my own in the race finishers' list, just as it's exciting to read what talented writers have written. I like looking at them and thinking that someday by training harder on the road, or working to improve my writing skills, perhaps I might rise a little higher in the ranks. And that's nice, right? That's a nice little thing!Then, though, there are the Paula Radcliffes and Haile Gebrselassies of the world. Elite athletes' two-hour-and-change marathons aren't exactly inspiring to me in any normal or useful sense, and describing them as humbling is so understated as to be meaningless. What these runners do doesn't fall under the same classification as what I and most other people do when we run. These runners' bodies do not seem human: they accomplish feats that aren't physically possible. There is barely a relationship between their \"running\" and my \"running,\" and that's where inspiration in its normal sense stops, and beyond even just being impressed with the individuals themselves, there's not much left to do except sit there and marvel that such things occur.Anyway, sometimes I feel like this when I'm reading. In the same way that I can't actually believe Radcliffe's human legs are capable of what they have done, I don't quite understand how Coetzee's brain manufactured this book.In my professional capacity, I've come to know some people who one might describe as being among the wretched of New York City. I'm talking about impoverished, chronically homeless, physically and mentally ill, largely powerless, pitied, and despised people who spend decades being shuffled through systems and slipping through cracks, sleeping in Port Authority tunnels and on trains and sidewalks, living under conditions that most other people can barely imagine. For a long time I've been impressed by how infrequently I come across good representations of these kinds of experiences in literature and other art forms, but I guess this makes sense. Illiterate people with little power or resources don't have much opportunity to create their own literature, and there are clear limits to knowledge of and empathy for these experiences by people who haven't lived through them. Okay, so to be fair I probably miss some good books about this, since I don't seek out that kind of literature and even consciously avoid it most of the time. This is in part because by the end of the day I'm a bit sick of the topic, but also because I do feel many treatments of this subject seem naive, insincere, idealized, unrealistic, or condescending.Not this book!I've known some guys over the years whose existences seem so fascinatingly horrible, but also almost miraculous and even kind of (uh, sorry) weirdly beautiful. I'm not generalizing here about the majority of my homeless clients, but thinking specifically of a few who just clearly weren't made for this earth. Like the HIV+ homeless schizophrenic who heard the voice of angels and looked like a saint, and it was just so unfathomable that he lived in a shelter among all this awful, sickening, dirty sad stuff that just had no relevance to him, dressed in gorgeous, outlandish outfits and cheeking his antipsychotics and antiretroviral drugs and talking to God.... Then those other ones, street-homeless for years, guys with mild mental retardation or traumatic brain injury and serious drug problems, who just don't have anything and there's no one who cares about them, and they wander through all these hells and horrors that you've got to think no one could ever survive, let alone someone with the mental capacity of a kindergartener.But really, it turns out, the world's full of these people, out there navigating streets filled with drugs and violence or being shuttled in and out of mental hospitals and jails and other institutions. It's pretty wild and disturbing stuff, and it seems almost impossible to imagine what kind of sense they make of these experiences that I could never fathom undergoing myself. This book pushed me further than my own imagination could towards a theory of what it might be like to exist while maintaining some part of oneself amidst levels of chaos and cruelty beyond my comprehension. I mean, this from a girl who gets pushed near complete mental breakdown by rude public cellphone use, or girls who spread their stuff out all over the bench in the gym locker room and won't share the space, or people getting uncivil on Bookface -- I mean, I've got an extremely low tolerance for any evidence of man's inhumanity (a questionable term -- \"brutality\" being similarly problematic) to man, and thinking about what it might be like to exist in war-torn, apartheid South Africa really does strain the limits of my gentle mind.But Coetzee sent me there, and pushed me through it.The Life and Times of Michael K hooked me at the beginning with its chillingly plausible description of homelessness. It's rare that reading a novel now, as an adult, can become the completely immersive, empathic experience that reading was for me as a child, but this book did that, and it did it starting in a situation I've spent a lot of time thinking about, but never lived through myself. Michael K follows the journey of a man who was born at the bottom, once the bottom falls out, and even though his situation's much worse than any of my clients', that was one place where it gave a possible answer to some long-standing questions I've had about the people I mentioned above. The book gave me an idea of what it might be like to experience things that are nearly impossible to convey in words. But as far as I'm concerned, Coetzee conveyed them!Another place it resonated with my professional experience was the second part of the book, which is from the perspective of a doctor who tries to care for Michael K in a work camp. Relating this to my own position as a social worker was such an intensely personal experience that I don't know if I can really get into it here. I'll just say that I'm really astounded by Coetzee's ability first to cultivate empathy like crazy, then to smash the reader brutally into its limitations. At least, that was one way I experienced it.This book presented a vision of individuals, systems, and societies that really is beyond the grasp of my own language abilities to describe or even comment on in a meaningful way. It also was just so successful in transporting me into another person and a different world, which is on the most basic level what any successful novel should do. I can't begin to guess at how this guy Coetzee's mind works; meanwhile, though, I'm intimately familiar with how his character Michael K's does! Yeah, so it wasn't vastly entertaining or necessarily a lot of fun all the time, but this book was pretty good, all right. Its author is, IMHO, among writers what Catherine Ndereba is among marathoners. That is to say, I can't pronounce either one of their names, and I have no idea how they do what they do, but I gotta admit that it's pretty amazing..", "Life and Times of Michael K completely lives up to the hype and deserves every fucking award it has received.

His tough wisdom:When my mother was dying in hospital, he thought, when she knew her end was coming, it was not me she looked to but someone who stood behind me: her mother or the ghost of her mother. To me she was a woman but to herself she was still a child calling to her mother to hold her and help her. And her own mother, in the secret life we do not see, was a child too. I come from a line of children without end. In manmade squalor there is beauty to be found; in the doltish, something special to offer the world; in the darkest despair, new levels of hope can be reached. As we go forward planting the seeds of who we are, especially in times of peril, if we stay true to ourselves, the beauty of our unique human condition makes its mark; meaning is carved out; life is strengthened and affirmed, and it all sprouts from what is inside us. Michael K. knows this. If you're thinking of reading Life and Times of Michael K. -- and I think you should -- be sure to read the reviews by David and Donald.

He has no father and his mother is a servant in Cape Town. Michael works as a gardener. South Africa is in the grip of civil war. When his mother becomes ill she asks to be taken back to her childhood home, a remote desert region some distance from Cape Town. The novella is about Michael\u2019s journey back to his roots. Coetzee does a fabulous job of imagining a mind almost bereft of intelligence. Michael becomes a thing of the earth, half human, half earthworm (as he once refers to himself). But the regime sees him as a parasite and all his (admirable) efforts at self-reliance are threatened at all times by an order intent on hunting him and his like down. It has to be said Michael himself, his simplicity, drives you a bit nuts at times \u2013 you stumble over that suspending of disbelief tripwire at times because although we\u2019re constantly reminded how simple Michael is there\u2019s a sense that such pure simplicity has to be a construct. However this is only an intermittent misgiving. The big flaw though is the late intervention of another voice. That of the doctor in the camp in which Michael is interned. There\u2019s a sense here that Coetzee is sermonising, telling us what we ought to make of Michael as allegory or symbol of his country\u2019s plight. Michael vanishes from the novella has a living presence to be replaced by an intellectual idea. And when we return to Michael in part three most of the magic has gone. If there had been no sermonising from the camp doctor I might have given this five stars but I can\u2019t get away from the feeling that this section of the novella was a clumsy error of judgement on Coetzee\u2019s part.Towards the end Michael remembers a schoolroom moment. His teacher sets the class a maths task. Twelve men eat six bags of potatoes. Each bag holds six kilograms of potatoes. He is asked what the quotient is. \u201cHe saw himself write down 12, he saw himself write down 6. He did not know what to do with the numbers. He crossed both out. He stared at the word quotient. It did not change, it did not dissolve, it did not yield its mystery. I will die, he thought, still not knowing what the quotient is.\u201d And this is the case, though we are also asked to acknowledge that \u201cenough men had gone off to war saying the time for gardening was when the war was over; whereas there must be men to stay behind and keep gardening alive, or at least the idea of gardening; because once that cord was broken, the earth would grow hard and forget her children.\u201d .", "Huh.The prose was detached and lifeless, as I have come to expect from Coetzee.

And this is depression and as you read it emanates from your very pores until you and the book are enveloped in it like a halo of light the colour of the outside of the universe.So that was good. I always like a book that makes me feel that way. Because here is a man who is alone, more alone than I have ever been and no one cares. Because here's the thing. I have a family and I have friends and if somehing happens to me they care. And I have this government that would give me money if I had none. And when I was sick I got the best medical care around, and it was free, because there's this attitude here that I matter and that everyone matters enough to deserve the same. And then there is Michael K, who doesn't matter to anyone, and all he wants to do is be left alone, but the establishment can't even do that. They have to take him and do things to him even though he can be of no conceivable use to them or anyone else. And he turns away from anyone who could help him and who wants to help him. And that was really good. By which I mean it was brilliantly portrayed and hopelessly moving.But then we get to part the third and suddenly the thing turns into this pathetic Coelho-esque excuse for a book. And it's full of patronising, pseudo-philosophical drivel that doesn't mean a thing. And the prose loses its beautiful detachment and becomes airy and pretty and floaty and suddenly I'm not liking it nearly so much any more. So I give it five stars for the first part and two point five for the last part, which I somehow average out to make four.___________________________________No, I probably shouldn't have borrowed this.

Here, also like with the unforgettable \"Animal's People\", the suffering and woe goes on and on and on, and that is why the decision for the brevity of the narrative is a wise one. The reader takes as much as he or she can handle, because unlike \"Animal's People\" the community of Michael K is heartless; the man is by himself and perpetually alone.

Coetzee had an insightful comment to the effect that one is free of the meddling of state officials only in the wilderness and on the high seas; so true. That meddling is so much the worse when the state aggressively pursues an unjust policy, and Coetzee was writing in the early 1980's in apartheid South Africa.On the whole, I very much enjoyed this book, and would recommend it..", "\u201cHe thought of himself not as something heavy that left tracks behind it, but if anything, as a speck upon the surface of an earth too deeply asleep to notice the scratch of ant feet, the rasp of butterfly teeth, the tumbling of dust\u201dI cannot say that I really understood this book.

I do not say that lightly, since it tends to be a hackneyed short-form that passes for literary criticism by those who read The Metamorphosis in high school, and haven't touched Kafka since then. But this novel wasn't just Kafkaesque, it was so reminiscent and derivative (complete with heavy-handed and direct allusions to The Hunger Artist and The Castle), that at one point, I thought I might well have given up on it and just read ... Kafka. But wait -- the best bits, the most poignant bits -- were the non-Kafka bits. The ones that read more as realistic character portrait of this sad, physically marred, mentally-deficient man, raised in cruelty and (it appears) squalor, and dumbly devoted to one thing: getting his Mother out of Cape Town. The first third, as Michael racks his brain to battle the bureaucracy and their poverty to get his mother out of the city; and when -- sob! -- *SPOILER ALERT* she dies after such a gruelling journey, and he lingered in the hospital, lost and alone, these bits were beautifully rendered and heartbreaking. Coetzee presents Michael K's remarkable idiot savant perceptions emerging from the strange and unique soup of this character's mind with somewhat overblown language, but also brilliantly. And then, it all goes awry as Michael K becomes some kind of Everyman crossed with Noble Savage, and the novel becomes allegory. Of something, who knows what.I hate allegories. And, I hate Kafka done by anyone other than Kafka. And I really hated the switch-up in POV/narration and ham-fisted philosophizing (in case we hadn't picked up, by then, that Michael K. was a capital-S Symbol. Which just made him far less human, and therefore less sympathetic, to me. But hey, that's just me. And I hate allegories.)This novel made me feel dumb and also angry, and not sad all the way through which is what it should have done.2.5 stars. .", "I enjoyed this bleak but also inspiring novel more than Disgrace.

We still refer to it as \u201cThe Farm\u201d, but only about a third of the land was arable, the rest was slate, covered with a thin crust of dust and scrub. There was a borehole and an orchard, a vegetable patch, chickens, three horses, two donkeys, a cow, and two pigs. There was also a family of nine \u2013 Wilson and Rebecca M. and their seven children \u2013 living in two small rooms behind the three garages that sheltered our Japanese sedans from the harsh African sun.Within a month, my parents had arranged to build two extra prefab rooms, one for the boys and one for the girls, and had ensured that all the children could attend the little mission school behind the quarry. The warm winds swiftly spread word of this charitable new family and soon people from surrounding farms came limping in with sick and injured relatives in need of medical attention. Clothes, food, transport and advice were also liberally dispensed.Let me stop there, because this is not intended as an ode to my parents\u2019 compassion, but rather as a counterpoint to Coetzee\u2019s vivid examination of the contention that there is freedom and even joy to be found in utter destitution. The author tempts the reader to ask himself: Do those who want or need next to nothing become irrelevant and therefore exempt from subjugation? Although it is risky to assign intent to the work of any author, this is the burning question I have taken from The Life and Times of Michael K \u2013 a book about a man who turns his back on an emaciated urban existence and seeks to return to the soil of his ancestors, carrying his dying mother on this back.On his way, Michael encounters numerous obstacles in a war-torn country \u2013 roadblocks, robbers and a detention camp, where one of the inmates has a truly novel perspective on the sinister motives underlying the charity of a regime that cares for its poorest by incarcerating them:\u201cAfter that they started dropping pellets in the water and digging latrines and spraying for flies and bringing buckets of soup. But do you think they do it because they love us? Not a hope. The prefer it that we live because we look too terrible when we get sick and die. If we just grew thin and turned into paper and then into ash and floated away, they wouldn't give a stuff for us. They just don't want to get upset. They want to go to sleep feeling good.\u201d (p. 88) Food for thought, in more ways than one. To what extent is our own sense of charity fuelled by such selfish motives? Who hasn\u2019t turned the sick and dying into paper and ash by simply switching channels on the remote? But Coetzee refuses to tread such beaten tracks. Instead, he takes the reader down the road less rutted. Michael escapes from the detention camp and makes his way out into the boondocks to the abandoned farm where his mother grew up. Here he finds a sense of place that lies somewhere between Freedom and Oblivion, digging a hovel for himself and living off the land, his sole purpose in life being the cultivation of pumpkins. This bucolic idyll is disturbed by a band of rebels, seeking to replenish their water supply at the farm, and later by a company of soldiers who capture and incarcerate Michael, because they suspect he is in cahoots with the guerrillas. Later, we find Michael in a rehabilitation centre, where he becomes the object of fascination of the doctor who is in charge of guiding him back into society. The second part of the book consists of the doctor\u2019s observations and musings, which again bear testimony to Coetzee\u2019s ability to distil crystal-clear metaphors from murky realities, letting his characters do the thinking and talking:\u201cHe is like a stone, a pebble that, having lain around minding its own business since the dawn of time, is now suddenly picked up and tossed randomly from hand to hand. A hard little stone, barely aware of its surroundings, enveloped in itself and its interior life. He passes through these institutions and camps and hospitals and God knows what else like a stone. Through the intestines of war. An unbearing, unborn creature. I cannot really think of him as a man, though he is older than me by most reckonings.\u201d (p. 135) All of which brings my back to The Farm, where Rebecca, Wilson and their children were tossed randomly from hand to hand like pebbles. Driven by curiosity rather than compassion, I went back to take a look several years after my parents had returned to the suburbs and I had emigrated to Holland. After negotiating passage with the farm\u2019s new owner, I found Rebecca in her room behind the garages. She embraced me warmly and then gave me a bleak update on the rest of the family \u2013 the dead, the dying, the incarcerated, the subjugated \u2013 pebbles reduced to dust by poverty\u2019s sledgehammer, a brilliant system of disenfranchisement that constantly reinforced the belief that some are destined to spend their lives as members of an underclass, a caste who could or should have no higher ambition than to seek joy in utter destitution.And so Coetzee has led me down the path less-rutted, causing me to reassess my own memories, ideas, morals and motives. Yes, the author and I share a South African background, but I am convinced that any reader will find a great deal to ponder, enjoy and recognise in The Life and Times of Michael K.Tomorrow, when I re-read this review, I will undoubtedly find much to be at fault or at best imprecisely surmised or argued. But perhaps that is greatest strength of Coetzee\u2019s work: it cannot be pinned down and made to reveal its intentions, but continues to provoke new questions and interpretations by remaining always open to new perspectives..", "The Life & Times of Michael K (1983) Author: J.M.

I'm sometimes on the fence about introductions, especially long introductions, Sartre's intro is 49 pages, because I think sometimes they suck the life out of the novel before you even have a chance to read the first page. Many introductions also assume that the reader has read the book previously. I took a chance mainly because I like Sartre and he did a wonderful job of preparing me for what I was about to experience.This book is an ode to onanistic activities or in other words masturbation. To be more specific this is a collection of fantasies that Genet wrote while in prison to help him achieve a chain of orgasms. Yes there are explicitly written parts, but do not categorize this book as pornography or a book of cheap thrills. Genet writes such lush, evocative scenes that the sex that may or may not occur is immaterial. Really this is about passion. This is about Genet making love to himself. The characters that flow through this novel from Divine, to Darling, to Our Lady of the Flowers, to Mimosa are all just derivatives of himself. He uses shells of ultra masculine males, gypsies, thieves, and beautiful young boys, that he has cut out of magazines, to fulfill his sexual fantasies, but underneath in the hollow parts of their bodies they are Jean Genet. \"When she talks to herself about Darling, Divine says, clasping her hands in thought: I worship him. When I see him lying naked, I feel like saying mass on his chest.\" We all hope that we can experience a moment where someone feels this way about us. For Jean Genet these characters sprang from his imagination fully formed as the perfect, flawed lovers that his mind could move about like furniture building up fantasies that ultimately leads to his satisfaction. Our Lady of the Flowers by Miriam Laufer\"Darling's life is an underground heaven thronged with barmen, pimps, queers, ladies of the night, and Queens of Spades, but his life is a heaven. He is voluptuary. He knows all the cafes in Paris where the toilets have seats. To do a good job, he says, I've got to be sitting down. He walks for miles, preciously carrying in his bowels the desire to shit, which he will gravely deposit in the mauve tiled toilets of the Cafe Terminus at the Saint-Lazare station.\"I thought this was a good example of Genet talking about something most of us never want or need to talk about and yet when I read this I had to stop and read it again and again because it is a beautiful statement about one of the most base things that we all are required by our design to perform. Yet he jolts us by uses the coarse word shit which is quickly softened with the word mauve. He has made taking a crap a pilgrimage, an event, that the character Darling will cherish, and look forward to consummating. And consuming. \u201cI wanted to swallow myself by opening my mouth very wide and turning it over my head so that it would take in my whole body, and then the Universe, until all that would remain of me would be a ball of eaten thing which little by little would be annihilated: that is how I see the end of the world.\u201d I've never read anything like this. There are flashes of Genet in the stream of consciousness of the Beat writers, certainly Thomas Pynchon had read Genet before writing Gravity's Rainbow. The surprising part of the book is how accessible it is. This book was compelling to read and even though some of the twists and turns left me dazed and confused I just let it wash over me and continued on.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at: https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten.", "Nothing if not hypnotic.

He takes all these Parisian homosexuals (his word), some of them evildoers -- murderers, thieves, prostitutes, assorted toughs -- though not necessarily evil people, it's just that like all of us they are capable of evil and from time to time actually commit it -- and he raises them to near saintly levels.

That's how big his empathy is. It's extraordinary. Jean-Paul Sartre in his introduction calls it a \"masturbatory\" novel undertaken simply to excite Genet during a long, boring incarceration at Fresnes Prison in 1942. This is no doubt true of the earlier drafts, which had long passages of graphic homosex. I don't think it's as true of the final text, which is no more pornographic than, say,  Lady Chatterley's Lover or  Ulysses. On the most immediate level one might declare that Genet's characters are never denied their fundamental humanity, or something equally grandiose. But that's hedging of course. Actually, I'm not sure how he does it. I may have to chalk it up to genius, but that will require at least one more reading. He subverts religion, in this case Catholicism, and uses it to build his own special transposed morality, in which murderers are saints and prostitutes angels. Crimes are committed for bizarre existential reasons. As when Divine let's a little neighborhood girl fall to her death from her ninth floor balcony so she can no longer be \"good.\" Genet plays with reader expectations as all great writers do. There's an ecstatic discursiveness to the writing, like a prose boomerang which arcs through seemingly unrelated material before returning to its point of origin in wholly unanticipated ways.

But the language thing would be extra; the reason Genet gets a kids show is that the message of this book is the same as those shows': this message being the glorious imperative to use your imagination.\"Use your imagination!\" When you think about it, it's a bit strange that there's such an emphasis on this in media for children, since they already are using their imaginations (or would be, anyway, if they weren't sitting in front of the TV). Since kids imagine things spontaneously without being told, this hysterical, unnecessary urging by the adults putting out TV probably has less to do with the children's edification than with something the adults are missing themselves. Maybe what Ernie and Barney are really saying is, \"Use your imagination NOW, kid, because one day real soon, it is going to shrivel up into a flaccid and desiccated and useless old husk, and you will be serving a life sentence in a filthy French prison called Adulthood, surrounded by bedbugs, sociopaths, and the rank stench of shit. And you'll have no recourse then, and no hope for escape.\"This, then, in the kids' show I'm developing, provides a nice segue into the basics of how capitalism should work. See, adult, you have no imagination; you are incarcerated (so to speak) in the cramped stinking cell that is reality, from which you cannot escape because you no longer possess that once-prized power to use your imagination. Fortunately, you can benefit from the fruits of our neighbor M. Genet's vigorous labor, since he does still have an imagination, and for a nominal fee he will let you use it (and for a couple francs more, you can use something else of his, too).And this is why we read: to get out of our lives. To get out of our cells. Okay, so that's a bit overwrought, but I mean it. We need other people's books because our brains are not enough, and our own imaginations are too feeble to invent worlds that will make ourselves free. See, I bet that would've sounded less cheesy if I'd written it in French! Those bastards really do get away with a lot.Awhile ago I reviewed Jim Thompson on here, and someone on the thread wondered if he'd ever read Proust. The thought of that made my stomach lurch -- of course he didn't! gross! -- but I'm willing to bet Genet read both guys (maybe at the same time), and swallowed them in the same mouthful with no sense of dissonance.I definitely wouldn't recommend this to everyone. It's almost assaultively poetic and gorgeous while incredibly raunchy and scatological, like an overpowering bouquet of gardenias and lilacs with erect penises popping out between the petals, in a cracked crystal vase set on the back of an overflowing toilet. If you think you might be fascinated by a swooningly imaginative, lovely fever dream of a pre-pre-Stonewall, pre-pre-pre-AIDS degenerate homosexual underworld and aesthetic, then this could potentially be a book you'd enjoy. Think pimps, wigs and teacups, thieves, murderers and pearls, boxers and graveyards, news clippings of killers, and a drag ball of queens in stained nineteenth-century gowns.... Think cock after cock after huge erect cock, with paeans to farting and a few trips to Mass. There's a trial. There's a funeral. There's a lot of jacking off! Instead of furry blue monster Grover's \"cooperation,\" M. Genet's neighborhood would emphasize the importance of \"la masturbation,\" an almost diametrically opposite concept but one also essential for the development of young people.If I were a more artistic soul myself, I might try and put together a Geneted-out Sesame Street version, since the pimps and queens would make beautiful muppets, and the animated sequences could really be something. Our Lady of the Flowers doesn't need that, though. It doesn't need me or anyone else; we need it! Truthfully, I think I really did need Our Lady. This is the first book I've read in awhile that actually changed the way that I think; I feel like it gave me a bit of a trepanning, sort of relieved some pressure on the skull and gave my uninteresting organ some more room to breathe. I was really living in the world a bit too much, and now I'm not here if I don't need to be. Genet did remind me that I don't have to stay here, and that if things become too oppressive I can just run off to become a male prostitute and live in a Parisian garret above a cemetery with my Negro and my adolescent psychopath, and a whole lot of drugs and makeup and fake jewels. It's too bad the fascistic policies of public television would likely not allow this glorious message of freedom to be shared with a nation of tots. For now, unfortunately, this book is limited to people who have learned how to read. The good news is, you can probably buy it used for a dollar! Though I might recommend a newer edition than the one I have, which identifies itself on the cover as \"A SHATTERING NOVEL OF HUMAN DEPRAVITY,\" which will make people look at you like you're just reading a bunch of trash.

ThJean Genet, the author, is serving time in 1940s Paris, and whilst awaiting sentencing begins to write, all sorts, on the back of brown paper bags: and voila: Our Lady of the Flowers is born. He would have used hundreds of these brown bags though: how did he ever get them.Genet writes to assist his masturbation (niiice), and cobbles together a patchwork quilt of personal reminiscences, fantasy, autobiographical sense data, general musings and various story threads of unascertainable veracity. The skeleton of Our Lady is framed by the multiple narrative of ostensibly one character, Jean Genet, who morphs continuously into a drag queen Divine, and Darling, his pimp. The narrative modes vacillate between \u2018She\u2019, \u2018I\u2019, and \u2018He\u2019 and it can\u2019t be ascertained if any of the different manifestations of the same character are real or a figment of his imagination. This heightened existentialist outlay then provides the perfect vehicle for showcasing the collapse of external reality, the denouncement of a fractured society, the purported destruction of consciousness, and the multiple perspectives of that same reality.The reality being that of a coterie of homosexuals, drag queens, petty thieves, murderers, male prostitutes and pimps: probably a pretty radical read for 1940s Paris. But what really makes this lasting fiction is not so much the forays of a criminal underclass (although that DOES have a voyeuristic appeal), but rather Genet\u2019s incredibly lyrical and imaginative word-smithing. Genet need only look at a peisage, and the quotidian becomes transformed under his linguistic auspices into strange and wonderful images. One of his victims becomes\u2019 a corpse, lying in a glass of champagne in the middle of a Greek landscape with truncated ringed columns around which long white tapeworms were twisting and streaming like coils\u2019. Divine loses Darling to a woman (well, only so he can be a kept man). This is how it happens: \u2018When he walked by, Darling was smoking, and a slit of abandon in the woman\u2019s hardness of soul chanced just then to be open, a slit that catches the hook cast by innocent looking objects. If one of your openings happens to be loosely fastened or a flap of your softness to be floating, you\u2019re done for\u2019.That has just got to be one of the most poetically rendered snapshots, ever, of love at first sight. Genet is nothing if not obligingly transgressive. We\u2019ve all heard of the good old prose poem, and Genet indulges duly in a nonpareil one page dream sequence. It is only at the end that the realisation dawns: this whole book is one giant, eloquent, prose poem. So, is there a catch? Well, yes, for me. In as much as the whole novel is a string of loosely connected but plausibly standalone etudes, I did reach a saturation point. Unfortunately before the end. Although I did finish it, and don\u2019t regret that I did. But, that old adage: how long is a piece of string? applies. In all the randomness of the build up, I don\u2019t know, I guess I reached masturbatory satisfaction before Genet did...", "My introduction to masturbation occurred when I was around nine years old.

A senior boy shared the secret. At home that afternoon, for the first time I rubbed my little prick and\u2026nothing. All I created was friction, sweat and boredom. It was as though my penis wasn\u2019t ready for what was being asked of it. A few hours later, however, I tried again, and on this occasion something did happen. The tinder started to smoulder; and then it caught fire. A small flame. I blew on it gently, scared in case it went out. The smoke intensified, rising swiftly. It entered my lungs and my breathing became laboured. Meanwhile, the fire grew bigger, warmer. I stoked it aggressively, and the warmth spread throughout my body. Then, just as quickly as it had ignited, the fire died, and I was left in pain.The following day, everything had changed. I saw the world differently. It had became fractured, yet fuller. Suddenly there were women. I felt as though I had given birth to them, had created them myself, in my bedroom, under the covers. I had created them, then cast them far and wide; and now I sought to gather them up, to reclaim them so as to use them in private. How many women have I jerked off to in the intervening years? Thousands? Someone I see on a train, in a shop, on the street. Celebrities, nobodies. I gather these women up, and store them away, for later, when they are always obliging, and always so expert at getting me off. Nobody can do me the way that they can do me, when I act as their intermediary.What is perhaps most attractive about masturbation is that it is an escape into another world, an imaginary, and better, world, over which you have control. The women I fondle and fuck, who gratefully grip and suck, are a conjurer\u2019s trick; they are in fact amalgamations, they are monstrously sown together from the body parts of various women. I am their father, and, in this way, they are one of the purest expressions of my self, as well as a means of avoiding myself and my circumstances. Wanking is, therefore, an indulgent and imaginative endeavour with a factual foundation, like writing, only more satisfying, of course, and less likely to be thrust upon an unsuspecting, and largely disinterested, public.Jean Genet\u2019s Our Lady of the Flowers was, it is said, written in prison on the brown paper that was issued to inmates in order to make bags. It is often described as [homo]erotica, but it differs from other books of that sort in that it was most likely not composed in order to make its readers hot, although it could function in this way, but rather as an aid to getting Genet off while he languished in his cell. Indeed, the narrator/author states that he has \u2018raised egoistic masturbation to the dignity of a cult\u2019 and lauds the \u2018pleasure of the solitary, gesture of solitude that makes you sufficient unto yourself, possessing intimately others who serve your pleasure without their suspecting it.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 are, in the main, pictures of hoodlums and murderers that he has taken from newspapers and pinned to the walls of his cell.It is no surprise, therefore, that Jean-Paul Sartre, who was a champion of the work, called it \u2018the epic of masturbation.\u2019 Yet this gives the impression that Our Lady of the Flowers is simply a record of Genet\u2019s adventures in pleasuring himself, that it is a kind of wanking diary, but the reality is something more complex and wonderful. The moments when the author is present in the text, with cock in hand, are infrequent; in fact, sex itself, explicitly explored, makes up only a small proportion of the book. Masturbation may have been the motivating factor, and much of the content may have served this purpose for the incarcerated Frenchman, but the most fascinating, beautiful, thing about Our Lady of the Flowers is how in fantasising about the criminals on his wall, in loving them, Genet\u2019s love \u2018endows them with life.\u2019Throughout Our Lady of the Flowers the pictures, and his own experiences and memories, even aspects of himself, are transposed into his characters and situations. He says of the transvestite Divine that \u2018it will take an entire book before I will draw from her petrifaction and little by little impart to her my suffering.\u2019 The real Divine he met, he writes, in Fresnes prison. She spoke to him of Darling Daintyfoot, another important character in the novel, but Genet \u2018never quite knew his face.\u2019 The author sees this as a \u2018tempting opportunity to make him merge in my mind with the face and build of Roger,\u2019 only very little of this man remains in his memory. Therefore, the Darling that \u2018exists\u2019 within the pages of Our Lady of the Flowers is a composite of many men, including \u2018the face of another youngster\u2019 he saw emerging from a brothel.So, for me, the book is more about the creative writing process than it is blowing your load, or is at least about the relationship between these two things. If you have ever attempted to create a character you will know that they are, in exactly the way that Genet describes, partly born from your rib, but also from a variety of other people you may have known or observed [and, as noted in my introduction, this is how masturbatory fantasies work too]. Moreover, as you breathe life into them, as you populate, you \u2013 as the creator \u2013 begin to understand your power, but simultaneously, ultimately, your powerlessness, over them. For example, as the author you can decide to give \u2018a breathing-spell, even a bit of happiness\u2019 to your creations, as Genet is tempted to do vis-a-vis Divine and Darling. Yet he also acknowledges that once brought to life these people in a sense exist independently [\u201cif it were up to me only, I would make of her the kind of fatal hero I like\u201d], that, once you have given them qualities, they must act in accordance with these qualities.I have thus far only mentioned in passing the author\u2019s preoccupation with murderers. For Genet, these people are \u2018enchanting\u2019, they are \u2018a wonderful blossoming of dark and lovely flowers.\u2019 Indeed, it is, he states, \u2018in honour of their crimes\u2019 that he is writing his book. One could understand this fascination in relation to sex, of course. In my review of Octave Mirbeau\u2019s The Torture Garden I explored the connection between sex and violence, so I do not want to repeat myself here; but, on a more basic level, we are all aware of the allure, the sexual potency, of the hard man, the dangerous man, the bit of rough, even if we do not subscribe to it ourselves. However, I believe that there is a deeper significance to Genet\u2019s interest, which is that violent criminals exist on the fringes of society, they have, intentionally, placed themselves outside of bourgeois or conventional society. Murderers are people of \u2018wild imagination\u2019, who have \u2018the great poetic faculty of denying our universe and its values so that they may act upon it with sovereign ease.\u2019 In this way, they are similar to his transvestites and homosexuals, and to himself.This attitude, this interest in and admiration for the unconventional, perhaps also explains why Christianity is such a consistent presence in the text. Indeed, on the first page Genet writes about his dislike of angels, which, he says, fill him with horror. Most frequently, the author uses Christian language or imagery to describe something that would be considered irreligious. For example, when Divine makes hard the cocks of two policemen, they are said to knock against the doors of their trousers, urging them to open \u2018like the clergy at the closed church door on Palm Sunday.\u2019 There is also, of course, the double meaning of the name Divine [who, moreover, dies at the beginning of the book and is then, in a sense, resurrected], and another transvestite prostitute is called First Communion. By repeatedly merging the divine and the debauched, Genet is deliberately dirtying Christianity \u2013 which preaches conventionality \u2013 by association.While all of what I have written about previously is of interest, and goes a long way to making Our Lady of the Flowers the masterpiece that it is, the biggest selling point, the most extravagantly plumed feather in the book\u2019s cap, is the quality of the prose. I ought to say that it is beautiful, amongst the most beautiful I have ever encountered, and leave it at that; but I will attempt some kind of discussion, anyway. Genet wrote in a kind of freestyle, or at least that it how it appears in translation, in an elegantly inelegant fashion. His sentences meander across the page, like a handsome, yet drunk, young couple. His imagery is at times ludicrous or fantastical \u2013 \u2018a pulled tooth, lying in a glass of champagne in the middle of a Greek landscape\u2019 \u2013 and at others precise or impressively restrained \u2013 \u2018the revolver/disappeared beneath the bed like an axe at the bottom of a pond.\u2019 In all instances, at all times, however, it satisfied me, it got me hard..", "What would you do if you found yourself in a prison cell serving a long sentence and facing the horrors of isolation, alienation, physical and psychological deprivation?You could:1) commit suicide;2) go nuts;3) go nuts and commit suicide;4) rape your cellmate;5) rape your cellmate and kill him because the voice of God is calling from the toilet bowl, asking for blood;6) miscellaneous.As for me, I know all too well what I would do: I'd spend my time thinking of all the lovers I've had since my teWhat would you do if you found yourself in a prison cell serving a long sentence and facing the horrors of isolation, alienation, physical and psychological deprivation?You could:1) commit suicide;2) go nuts;3) go nuts and commit suicide;4) rape your cellmate;5) rape your cellmate and kill him because the voice of God is calling from the toilet bowl, asking for blood;6) miscellaneous.As for me, I know all too well what I would do: I'd spend my time thinking of all the lovers I've had since my teens. All of them. Males, females, single, married, straight, queer, respectable, embarrassing. From the most insignificant random fuck to the one and only love of my life, I would think of them so intensely and desperately they would come back again and gather for me. I would smell their skin, stroke their hair, hear their voices and feel their bodies onto mine as if we had never parted. Like a necromancer, my soul would bring back all its ghosts and my desire would give them a new shape, utterly beyond my own understanding and will. And then I would make them meet, mate, merge, kill each other - presiding over their very existence, which would now be nothing but a mere extension of my mind. That's exactly what Genet's narrator/alter ego does in the most poetic and hallucinated work of Existentialist literature to date. What starts as a homosexual prisoner's masturbatory stream-of-consciousness monologue turns out to be an atlas of the soul, an astronomy of lust and memory. A journey through his own fading self by means of all the bodies and identities he loved and desired, puppets moving on a stage only he can see. A psychodrama played by ghosts.Divine, Notre-Dame-des-Fleurs, Mignon, Mimosa, Premi\u00e8re Communion; those are the kings and queens of the French underworld of the Forties. Whether we look at them as outcasts or romantic heroes, their heartrending grandeur permeates the narrator's dreams and nightmares. Kids, men, transvestites, pimps, hustlers, petty thieves, murderers - repulsive and gorgeous, vain and vile, innocent and corrupt: these are the fallen angels and saintly demons inhabiting the recesses of Genet's mind as well as the seedy streets of Paris, carrying around the burden of their desperate beauty through the decay they thrive in (\"The kids were indeed waiting to commit some real crime as a pretext to go to hell\"), a light shining through the mist of time and the veil of guilt, loss and regret.The thing is, our ineffable narrator is locked up in a prison cell. The outside world has long ceased to exist for him; all these people, feelings and memories belong to another universe, a plane of reality he is now totally deprived of. Withdrawal - psychological implosion - is the narrator's only means to reach out and keep in touch with reality. As a matter of fact, the only way out is a way in, until the border between the outer world and the narrator's innermost perception gets so blurred he himself starts morphing into a character in his narration. It's almost impossible to discern between erotic fantasy and reliable (auto)biographic contents here. Impossible and pointless: 'abstract memoir' is the only fitting definition- a dimension in which the texture of time, space and self-consciousness are tore apart by razor-sharp blade of the written word. In his own words,\"This book is but a mere particle of my inner life.\"A particle indeed, one single atom of a man's most elusive matter. Today we're painfully aware of the terrifying power of the infinitely small; we're well acquainted with the omnipotence of the atom. Genet's writing is the splitting of that inmer atom and the devastating blast that follows.Have a look at the excerpts I picked for my updates and you'll realise how beautiful his prose is, how poetic, how graphic; what a musical quality his voice has throughout the book. Lighter than the petals of a wild flower carried away by a summer storm. From the very first page the reader must give up on any attempt to trace the convoluted contours of this arabesque. Somewhere between the Divine Comedy and the Com\u00e9die Humaine, this is Genet's contribution to the most impure Holy Scriptures ever written..", "Paris, France during the 40's.

Description of Darling: height, 5 ft. 9 in., weight 165 lbs., oval face, blond hair, blue-green eyes, mat complexion, perfect teeth, straight nose. Divine loves him so much that she worships Darling's cock that she has made a plaster cast of it. Description of the cock: gigantic when erect. The most impressive thing about it is the vigor, hence the beauty, of that part which goes from the anus to the tip of the penis. To Divine, Darling is everything. She takes care of his penis. Darling's penis is in itself all of Darling: the object of her pure luxury. If Divine is willing to see in her man anything other than a hot, purplish member, it is because she can follow its stiffness, which extends to the anus, and can sense that it goes farther into his body, that it is this very body of Darling erect and terminating in the pale, tired face, a face of eyes, nose, mouth, flat cheeks, curly hair, beads of sweat.. Darling loves Divine too. Darling gets a hard on even when Divine just looks at his crotch. Divine has had previous lovers like the young boy, Alberto and the black man, Gabriel but she feels that Darling is the best. However, one day when Darling is about to turn 30, Darling goes home with another of his lover, Our Lady of the Flowers. Description of Our Lady of the Flowers: height, 5 ft. 7 in., weight, 156 lbs., oval face, blond hair, blue eyes, mat complexion, perfect teeth, straight nose. It is obvious that Darling and Our Lady of the Flowers have similar features. Hence, Our Lady's edge over Divine.French writer and an openly gay man, Jean Genet (1910-1986) wrote Our Lady of the Flowers(Notre Dame des Fleurs) while he was incarcerated in Paris prison for burglary. Genet was abandoned by his parents as a boy so he grew up with people not related to him and became a young thief. When WWII broke out, the young man Genet served as an army man alongside Hitler's German forces. The war disillusioned him further and compounded his angst. During his 10th incarceration,he wrote the manuscript of his first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers on paper bags provided to inmates. The manuscript was confiscated and burned several times but he persisted. When it came to the hands of Jean-Paul Satre (1905-1980), he marveled at Genet's talent so he and his friends, Andre Gide (1869-1951) and Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) petitioned for Genet's release. The French government granted it.Reading Our Lady of the Flowers made me remember Marquis de Sade's (1740-1814) 120 Days of Sodom minus the rampant rapes and senseless killings. The edition of my book has Satre calling the book as epic of masturbation. I do read erotic novels, some of them with gay men as characters, but this is my first time to read a classic book which describes the homosexual acts in details. It is not as distasteful as De Sade's because Genet made his men (gay and non-gays) seemed to be in-love during those sexual acts and one of them don't get killed by the other after they climaxed so I would not say that those scenes are grossly as distasteful. Again my mantra: it is their body, it is their life, it is what they want, so be it. Regardless of whether the reader is a straight man or gay, I think what should be appreciated in this book are two: (1) the beautiful playful prose which is almost like a long lyrical poem is definitely a joy to read and (2) that Genet wrote this inside the prison cell trying to express his protest against WWII and the French society in general. .", "THE REVIEWS ARE IN!!!

He wonders if \u201cpoetry is only the reverse side of masturbation\u201d (15). That stuff may be philistine (and Sartre\u2019s handling of the admittedly complicated gender politics is likewise woefully inadequate), but he does situate the general politics well: one might contrast the humanistic universe of Rimbaud and Nietzsche, in which the powers of the negative shatter the limits of things, with the stable and theological universe of Baudelaire or Mallarme, in which a divine crosier shepherds things together in a flock, imposing unity on discontinuity itself. That Genet chose the latter is only to be expected. In order to do evil, this outcast needs to affirm the pre-existence of good, that is, of order. At the very source of his images is a will to compel reality to manifest the great social hierarchy from which he is excluded. (30) Author (or is it narrator?) is \u201can exile from our bourgeois, industrial democracy\u201d and is thereby \u201ccast into an artificial medieval world\u201d (33). This text is accordingly a \u201cbotany of the underworld\u201d (39), wherein all characters have \u201cthe same categorical imperative: since you don\u2019t have faith enough to believe in us, you must at least make others adopt us and must convince them that we exist\u201d (49). So much for Sartre. Text proper is labor intensive. Its statement of purpose is ostensibly \u201cin honor of their crimes\u201d (51), regarding specific seemingly historical executed persons. (Honoring the crimes however strikes me like a signature moment of lumpenized antisocial nihilism.) Text lays out a phantasmagoric narrative/metanarrative. Productive perhaps to examine on the basis of conceptual axis.Corpus/animus\u2014In reflecting on the persons honored for their crimes, supra, narrator suggests that they are \u201cbodies chosen because they are possessed by terrible souls\u201d (53), which is a concern that we might see show up in Agamben\u2019s most recent, The Use of Bodies, incidentally. We see a \u201cblessed body in a supernatural nimbus\u201d (54), the consecrated corpus, subject to agambenian devotio, quite plausibly in this narrative. One character\u2019s death is likened to \u201cJesus the gilded chancre where gleams His flaming Sacred Heart. So much for the divine aspect of her death. The other aspect, ours, because of those streams of blood that had been shed\u201d (57) (cf. Marlowe\u2019s \u201cChrist\u2019s blood streams in the firmament\u201d). \u201cWhen I see him lying naked, I feel like saying mass on his chest\u201d (84). The consecration runs to the point of radical corporeal disaggregation: she \u201clived only on tea and grief. She ate her grief and drank it; this sour food had dried her body and corroded her mind\u201d (155).Gender ISA\u2014Althusser\u2019s ideological state apparatus (perhaps as described in our review of Butler\u2019s  Gender Trouble) is thoroughly frustrated in this text. I hope that this is not the reason that I identify the presentation as lumpenized antisocial nihilist. Specifically, characters are not stable with regard to pronoun usage: \u201cDivine died yesterday in a pool of her own vomited blood\u201d (57). But: \u201cthe duplicity of the sex of fags\u201d (114). The alleged 'duplicity' is borne out regarding the same character, who is always subject to indetermination on this point: She tried for male gestures, which are rarely the gestures of males [\u2026] she was supposed to show she was virile so as to capture the murderer, she would end up burlesquing them, and this double formula enveloped her in strangeness [xenos], made her a timid clown in plain dress [\u2026] to crown her metamorphosis from female into tough male, she imagined a man-to-man friendship which would link her with one of those faultless pimps whose gestures could not be regarded as ambiguous. (133-34) Narrator will \u201cmake myself a male who knows that he really isn\u2019t one\u201d (104), which is an aporia perfectly emblematic of a gender ISA in terminal crisis. Divine, \u201cthough she felt as a \u2018woman,\u2019 she thought as a \u2018man.\u2019 One might think that, in thus reverting spontaneously to her true nature [!], Divine was a male wearing make-up, disheveled with make-believe gestures\u201d (224). In one character\u2019s presence, Divine \u201cmanaged to think \u2018woman\u2019 with regard to serious but never essential things. Her femininity was not only a masquerade\u201d (225). \u201cNo doubt, she herself was not a woman (that is, a female in a skirt [wtf?]); she was womanly [!] only through her submission [!!] to the imperious male [!!!!]\u201d (id.). It is perhaps, in the context of the Gender ISA, that Divine \u201cis present wherever the inexplicable arises\u201d (263), like the radical corporeal disaggregation of the \u201cwax dummy that had been disassembled\u201d (id.). But it shall have \u201chardly affected her opinion of herself to know that she had brought forth a monstrous [sic] creature, neither male nor female\u201d (298), noting well the equivocation of the ISA in the form of monstrosity.Warning\u2014Narrator notes \u201cthe foul monstrousness of my arrest\u201d (103). But he also recalls that he had the sacred sign [sic] of the monster the corner of his mouth [\u2026] The flaw on the face [sic] or in the set gesture indicates to me that they may very possibly love me, for they love me only if they are monsters. (55) The self-denigration is premised upon a curious agambenian \u2018sacredness,\u2019 as with the blessed body, supra\u2014but further proceeds from an ancient etymology: early 14c., \"malformed animal or human, creature afflicted with a birth defect,\" from Old French monstre, mostre \"monster, monstrosity\" (12c.), and directly from Latin monstrum \"divine omen, portent, sign; abnormal shape; monster, monstrosity,\" figuratively \"repulsive character, object of dread, awful deed, abomination,\" from root of monere \"warn\" (see monitor (n.)). Abnormal or prodigious animals were regarded as signs or omens of impending evil. Extended by late 14c. to imaginary animals composed of parts of creatures (centaur, griffin, etc.). Meaning \"animal of vast size\" is from 1520s; sense of \"person of inhuman cruelty or wickedness\" is from 1550s. As an adjective, \"of extraordinary size,\" from 1837. In Old English, the monster Grendel was an agl\u00e6ca, a word related to agl\u00e6c \"calamity, terror, distress, oppression. The reference to monitor is pregnant: 1540s, \"senior pupil at a school charged with keeping order, etc.,\" from Latin monitor \"one who reminds, admonishes, or checks,\" also \"an overseer, instructor, guide, teacher,\" agent noun from monere \"to admonish, warn, advise,\" which is related to memini \"I remember, I am mindful of,\" and to mens \"mind,\" from PIE root *men- \"to think\" (see mind (n.)). The monstrous is accordingly not only a warning, but also the marker of memory, the ward against etymological amnesty\u2014\u201cfreeing an anguished memory that had been haunting me [sic] since the world began\u201d (56) (Cain\u2014Grendel? Or is it rather the Leviathan?). Narrator drifts \u201cto the inner gaze of memory, for the matter of memory is porous\" (57). Narrator wanted one person to \u201clove me, and of course he did, with the candor that required only perversity for him to be able\u201d (77), and the \u201cmemory of his memory made way for other men\u201d (76). And yet: \u201cHe tries to regain his composure, stops to catch his breath, and (in the silence), surrounded by objects that have lost all meaning now that their customary user has ceased to exist, he suddenly feels himself in a monstrous world made up of the soul of the furniture, of the objects\u201d (118-19).What monsters continue their lives in my depths? Perhaps their exhalations or their excrements or their decomposition hatch at my surface some horror or beauty that I feel is elicited by them. I recognize their influence, the charm of their melodrama. My mind continues to produce lovely chimeras. (122) How is there a threshold of indistinction (heh) at beauty/horror, incidentally? The monstrous appears obliquely, agambenian euphemism perhaps, in \u201coutside reigns terror\u201d (135) (agl\u00e6ca, supra), but also as \u201cdecorative monsters\u201d (138) and how one \u201cthought he was penetrating her with his whole centaur body\u201d (150). The nexus of the monstrous with radical corporeal disaggregation is, as with the epainos/logos (see infra), via eros: he had steeped himself in all the monstrosities of which she was composed. He had passed them in review: her very white dry skin, her thinness, the hollows of her eyes, her powdered wrinkles, her slicked down hair, her gold teeth. He noted every detail. (155) And this is how \u201che knew ecstasy\u201d (id.). But \u201cin imagination our heroes are attracted, as girls are, by monsters\u201d (199). The monstrous, as marked by corporeal disaggregation, is part of the tradition of grotesque realism, insofar as one \u201cfeels the same repulsion for all infirmities as he did for reptiles\u201d (208). Narrator through \u201cmonstrous horror\u201d is \u201cexiled to the confines of the obscene (which is the off-scene of the world),\u201d which is reasoned to be the \u201corigin of the world and at the origin of the world\u201d (301)\u2014the condition of possibility of the arche is the monstrous, the warning.Hard Fucking\u2014The main appeal of course is prurient, mixed in with unforeseeable abstractions. Who after all shall object to \u201cI was his at once, as if [\u2026] he had discharged through my mouth straight to my heart\u201d (60)? Or to how something \u201cmade the abbe\u2019s spine stiffen and draw back with three short jerks, the vibrations of which reverberated through all his muscles and on to infinity, which shuddered and ejaculated a seed of constellations\u201d (69)? Or to when \u201che will rise up, become erect, and penetrate me so deeply that I shall be marked with stigmata\u201d (77)? There\u2019s some indication that these are presented as mere phantasm, insofar as the narrative is interpolated with comments such as \u201cnow I am exhausted with inventing circumstances\u201d and \u201cI have a cramp in my wrist\u201d (id.). Otherwise, much of interest. We see the coincidence of both epainos and logos with eros, such that the third is the condition of possibility for the others: \u201cif I think about him, I can\u2019t stop praising him until my hand is smeared with my liberated pleasure\u201d (61). Manual praise, the epainos liberated, is kinda kickass. Let it be a warning to ye. Or, rather, let a bakhtinian grotesque realism be a warning: I wanted to swallow myself by opening my mouth very wide and turning it over my head so that it would take in my whole body, and then the Universe, until all that would remain of me would be a ball of eaten thing which little by little would be annihilated: that is how I see the end of the world. (75)Closely aligned with the bakhtinian interest is Kristeva\u2019s Powers of Horror, to the extent that \u201cdehumanizing myself is my own most fundamental tendency\u201d (82), when that tendency is marked out by \u201cthe hidden splendor [\u2026] of his abjection [sic],\u201d \u201csoiled them with his own abjection\u201d (id.).The phallos otherwise as not so much the transcendental signified of phallogocentrism, but rather \u201can object of pure luxury\u201d (106), as the necessary economic good is reflected in \u201cI lived in the midst of an infinity of holes in the form of men\u201d (174).Recommended for those who serve a text they know nothing about, readers whose love is akin to despair, and persons forced to love what they loathe..", "Utterly against my expectations, I ended up deeply moved by this work.

Or this one: Our domestic life and the law of our Homes do not resemble your Homes. We love each other without love. It all just seemed so very The Boys in the Band. It reminded me of a scene from one of Edmund White\u2019s novels where one character says to another that a gay man will be enamoured of a straight man until he actually manages to seduce him. Upon which occurrence, the man loses all appeal, becoming just another Mary. My other reaction was frankly tedium at a work whose value lay apparently in its shock value at its time by its frank depiction of gay sex and sanctification of gay prostitutes and murderers. While a straight Catholic in the 1940s might find much to be shocked by in this work, there could be no horripilating frisson for me, a gay atheist in 2019. I thought, well, it\u2019s just of a piece with Serrano\u2019s  Piss Christ isn\u2019t it, *yawn*. As it turned out, I was more right on that than I knew. For Serrano, a religious man, said this about his work: The thing about the crucifix itself is that we treat it almost like a fashion accessory. When you see it, you\u2019re not horrified by it at all, but what it represents is the crucifixion of a man. And for Christ to have been crucified and laid on the cross for three days where he not only bled to death, he shat himself and he peed himself to death. So if \u2018Piss Christ\u2019 upsets you, maybe it\u2019s a good thing to think about what happened on the cross. Now, I am in no way suggesting or implying the Jean Genet had any intention of glorifying Catholicism through Notre-Dame-des-Fleurs. But he was most definitely reaching for a transcendental spiritualism using the images of the religion of his cultural milieu, by mining the poetry of these for his own internal salvation from the despair of prison life. The beauty of his images (I won\u2019t say his language since I read this in translation, having given up with struggling with 1940s gay and criminal argot French) swept over me and won me over by the last 10% of the novel. Its striking, I found myself thinking, how people forget that Jesus was condemned as criminal, no more worthy in the eyes of his contemporaries than Our Lady of the Flowers was to his. And for Genet to find his peace, his life raft in this act of creation, that just blew me away. I\u2019m very glad I didn\u2019t give up on the work..", "This was hard, but there is an unmistakable art in Genet's writing--a sensuality as it should be: consumed with textures and scents.

This might have been another instance of reading a classic too late, when I'd already read so much inspired by it that the original wasn't terribly interesting on its own merits. Still, Our Lady has atmosphere & visuals, and regardless of remembering books that were more elegant sentence-on-sentence, I eventually got lost in it regardless. The truly sordid origins of bedsit glamour. A book I find easiest to sum up as an image: a paint-peeling room with a motheaten red-velvet throne and scuffed fake Louis Quinze furniture (long before the rough luxe trend, and with altogether too much damp to be salubrious) inhabited by a fabulous drag queen whose lovers are wiry, starveling scallies forever in and out of prison. And of course Genet in his cell imagining it all, and wanking off to pictures of men he's stuck to the wall. These characters are from fetishy fantasies and daydreams scribbled on secret bits of paper; they don't have conventionally rounded personalities; those who want healthily empathic description of everyone won't find it here. The urgency of getting off and of mental escape from confinement makes this an overwhelming visual and breathlessly fixated ...story... set of stories? There is the thread of a plot, but images and scenes wheel about, not entirely continuous.I got round to this now because I wanted to read Patti Smith's Just Kids - in it she mentions Genet literally about 30 times. The rhythms of her run-on lyrics from Horses can be heard in some paragraphs; there are lines I knew from Bowie and possibly The Divine Comedy; imagery and favourite words I recognise from people I've met, who must have read this. So much here was familiar even whilst the specifics of the plot weren't. Ages after I first read Martin Amis describing his characters on the loo, I'm not shocked by Genet's accounts of same, nosepicking etc as contemporaries were (though what with all the farting, I wondered if the Reeves & Mortimer farting characters [the Petermains?] were French because of this & Evgenie Sokolov). It's simply very embodied, in including both ecstatic and base bodily functions. (All belonging to people who are more or less beautiful.) I've never stopped being shocked though, that people were still judicially beheaded in Western Europe in the twentieth century.To read Genet in a cheap edition with loads of typos, without ever having compared translations, seems true to the spirit of the thing, but this is also a book that's overdue for the full introduction and notes treatment..", "The best prison novel ever!

Genet's set of characters, fashioned from his abyssal imagination opposite the four walls of his cell where he makes them wear the clothes and personalities he wants, wanders in a world of pimps and criminals. They blend themselves then create a murky intersection of Genet and his characters; Genet is his characters; these characters are Genet: \"[...] the story of Divine, whom I knew only slightly, the story of Our Lady of the Flowers, and, never fear, my own story.\" His words harden, but in rare moments they unexpectedly soften. And when they do, Our Lady of the Flowers touches the underground tunnel of vulnerable existence (\"She will go on living only to hasten toward Death.\" and \"I wanted to swallow myself by opening my mouth very wide and turning it over my head so that it would take in my whole body, and then the Universe, until all that would remain of me would be a ball of eaten thing which little by little would be annihilated: that is how I see the end of the world.\"). It can be devastating and painful too. This is very different than most and I might as well say, perhaps, groundbreaking with its structure and content. But I don't think I would have appreciated it better if I did not read Sartre's brilliant introduction. His deep insight about the book's significance and the linear sentiments in its non-linearity makes it shine into another kind of light. But this is not something I would say I find totally stimulating and arousing nor can I say this has moved and seduced me. Stumbling upon it in a list of books Susan Sontag recommended I can't help but wonder if I dealt with it as best as I could without the preconceived notions I shaped for myself after merely reading the synopsis.

No book I\u2019ve read engages the reader in such a way. Genet exerts striking authorial control. He breaks in on his basic story, a mystery of mayhem involving two main characters, whenever he needs to bring himself back to earth about his actual imprisonment in 1942.

Samples of Genet\u2019s prose give a taste of his style:--Her hands, freed from the revolver, which disappeared beneath the bed like an ax at the bottom of a pond, like a prowler into a wall, her hands, lighter than thoughts, fluttered about her.--Culafroy did not know that a violin ... could upset his sensitive mother, and that violins moved about in her dreams in the company of lithe cats, at corners of walls, under balconies where thieves divide the night\u2019s loot, where other toughs slouch around a lamppost, on stairways that squeak like violins being skinned alive. --Night emerges from his eyes and spreads over his face, which begins to look like pines on stormy nights ...Just superb. As to the self-analysis, fans of Sartre will be amazed at degree of existentialism in Genet\u2019s descriptions. But that\u2019s subtext, and most readers will enjoy the story without that added layer of meaning. A jackboot of masochism kicks faces, but the overt sex isn\u2019t nearly as much as you\u2019d expect. The prose, then, is strong enough to cross over to a straight audience with diverse reading habits. I've got to add that the Frechtman translation is so good that I went for pages thinking I was reading about Americans. I recommend the book as a classic of its genre. .", "I'm not entirely sure how to properly vocalize what it is that was so enticing about 'Our Lady.'

Definitely not for those who like a more straightforward or traditional narrative, 'Our Lady' nonetheless is a pretty interesting peek at the harder to find queer \"art house novel.\".", "Unique erotica, like no other book ever written.

Doppler takes to living a solitary life in the forest. He goes off grid hoping to cleanse his soul. Although it seemed he had a successful family and career life--he felt society failed him... and he failed it. He leaves his family and job behind. They weren't invited. By the way... I'm in favor of couples taking - solitary well being get-a-ways - but I feel they always work best with the support of 'both' partners. That's not 'this' story.....but set that aside for a bit... another valuable story sneaks up on us. After Doppler kills a moose - ( a guy needs to eat). Turns out the calf is a female and Doppler feels bad about killing her. He begins to explain to \"Bongo\", why she is better off not alive. Doppler is very convincing. Ongoing conversations continue between Doppler and Bongo... ( well Doppler does the talking - Bongo the listening) ..... it's sweet, absurd.....but we feel the 'luv-connection'. Basically Doppler is speaking out loud working out his personal life issues. Things begin to change. His wife is pregnant - and gets message to him that it's his duty to come home. (Well, yes, I agree... but I wasn't done with the story yet)... Also, a new neighbor is now nearby. Doppler is no longer alone. Over time, Doppler doesn't recognize his own forest any longer. It doesn't look quiet and peaceful any longer and he wonders if he and Bongo have come to the wrong forest.  \"One problem with people is that as soon as they fill a space it's them UC and not the space. Large, desolate land scapes stop being large, desolate land scapes once they have people in them. They defined what the eyes see. And the human eye is almost always directed at other humans. In this way and illusion is created that humans are more important than those things on earth which are not human. It's a sick illusion. Perhaps elk are the most important creatures when it comes down to it, I say to Bongo. Perhaps you're the ones who know best but are extremely patient. I doubt that, of course, but who knows? It's definitely not humans anyway. I refuse to believe that.\" Moral of the story..... haha .... if nobody listens to you when you're trying to share something important-- perhaps consumerism? go talk to Bongo!

The old man discovers him, of course, and then they hang out and play with model trains and eat chocolate like they are 8 year olds. Seriously.The guy also owns a compass and a cell phone (how does he recharge???) and his wife comes to visit him in the forest for sex because he has such a massive organ she just can\u2019t help herself. He even builds a totem in the woods, he\u2019s literally building a giant dick in celebration of his own member, after which the book is named. Doppler refers to his double sized penis. I kid you not.I have never eye-rolled or raged as much as I did reading this pile of nonsense, much to my mom\u2019s amusement when I called her to rant, but it was a school assignment, so I has no choice but to get through it.

And yes, I wrote \u2018buy into\u2019 deliberately.Doppler leaves his wife and two children because he is sick and tired of being nice, he doesn\u2019t want the only focus in his life to be how much money he makes. He want a simpler life. Or maybe he had a concussion and is having a breakdown because his father died. This is never clear. He feels lucky to have hit his head and realized the wrongness of his ways \u2013 but whether this is a sudden moral clearness or a brain damage, is up to the reader to decide. To be fair, it\u2019s not really hinted that it could be something wrong with him, the author probably intends it as an awakening.But the fact is, Doppler lives in a tent in a forrest just on the edge of Oslo and to sustain himself, he steals from the nearby houses \u2013 and he kills an elk. This elk turns out to be a mother to a young calf and so Doppler ends up adopting a calf which he names Bongo: \u2018I\u2019ll call the calf Bongo after my father, I decide as I\u2019m strolling back into the forrest. Even though my father wasn\u2019t called Bongo I\u2019ll name the calf Bongo after him. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to be open to associations of this kind.\u2019 (p. 32-33).Doppler and Bongo build a close relationship \u2013 at least that\u2019s the way Doppler relates it to us. They play games, they have long talks, they pee together and just hang out. Even though Doppler thinks Bongo is a bit thick since he doesn\u2019t quite understand even the simplest games, he still loves him. They build a sort of father-son relationship which is obvious since Doppler just lost his father \u2013 but strange, since he has a young son at home, missing him. This is not the only father-son relationship. His son eventually joins him in the forrest and Doppler also meets a man who spends his time recreating the part of World War II where his father lost his life. And inspired by this, Doppler decides to build a totem pole to honor his father; a pole, which seems more to honor the idea of a father and fatherhood than the man who was Doppler\u2019s father. Maybe because Doppler didn\u2019t really know him.This novel focuses on one man\u2019s struggle to find himself in a world that doesn\u2019t focus all that much on introspection. It is difficult for him to find peace in the forest since he gets company soon, both from other people and from his young son. Maybe also because he didn\u2019t really leave civilization all that far behind. Maybe the novel is more intended to show us that we are really not capable of living this way anymore?It is quirky in a lot of ways and there were parts of it I really liked. For instance, his annoyance with children shows\u2019 theme songs. He actually ends up giving his son\u2019s DVDs away to a robber one night \u2013 what parent haven\u2019t imagined that? Maybe even dreamed of that?Another part shows him being annoyed with the Iraq war because it comes at a time where he is focused on redecorating the bath room: \u2018I remember being irritated when I discovered that now we would also have to take a stance on this war. It was very distracting. As if it wasn\u2019t enough to have to decide on all this bathroom stuff. Now we would have to take sides in Iraq. I didn\u2019t like things going on in the world which in effect reduced what I used my brainpower on to trivia. Not only did I not have my perspectives clarified, but I didn\u2019t want them to be. For weeks it had irritated me that they couldn\u2019t wait to start the bombing down there until we had finished doing up the bathroom.\u2019 (p. 22). I love this quote and it shows something very true about our way of life, I think. That we are fine thinking about the troubles other places in the world as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with our own daily lives.But with all that being said, I was a little disappointed in this book. I had expected something funnier and quirkier. Quirky in particular. With that cover, that subject, I had expected something that would leave me with a lot of food for thoughts and ideas for other ways to see the world and our society, our materialistic culture. But I didn\u2019t feel like I got it and in the end, I felt I was kind of left hanging, like what you get is a short series of impressions with a rather clear beginning but not so much of a clear ending. I\u2019m not sure how I would have liked it to end \u2013 but what I got, wasn\u2019t enough..", "Story about a man who goes living in forest, after having serious brain injury and sudden loss of a father who he never knew and questions life essences and his life.

As he is lying prone in the still forest, Doppler experiences unfamiliar peace, and whether this is a soul-deep epiphany or the result of a concussion, he decides to abandon his wife and family and go to live in a tent in the forest. The blurb for Doppler assures me that I'll find the ensuing story both poignant and hilarious \u2013 you will read it with tear-stained cheeks and sore sides \u2013 but I can't say that was quite my experience: charming and quirky, this was a good, if not quite great read.There is nothing like man and animal working in close collaboration against the forces of evil.After killing a mama moose with only a knife, Doppler is forced to adopt her calf; a gangly little fellow who won't stop following the man around. Doppler decides to name him \u201cBongo\u201d after his recently deceased father (despite \u201cBongo\u201d not having been his father's name), and the little moose serves as sounding board for Doppler's anti-societal rants, and well as his comic foil, and substitute family (everyone has Daddy issues in this book and Doppler works through his with a moose calf and a totem pole). We learn that Doppler is tired of being nice all the time, he realises that he doesn't actually like people, and when he successfully barters extra moose meat for essentials, he discovers that Capitalism is a trap. Unfortunately, the few men that Doppler does encounter during this period are attracted to his hermitical philosophy, and the newly-minted misanthrope finds his corner of the forest filling up with fellow escapees. There are other things besides Smart Club and childrens birthdays and dinner with so-called friends and our repulsively Norwegian notion of social cosiness, which allows us to be both the most affable and the most self-centered nation in the world.It's nicely ironic that I've read a book about someone rejecting this Scandinavian love of cosiness at the same time that the rest of the world is becoming aware of it \u2013 the Danes have Hygge, the Swedes embrace Lagom, and apparently the Norse call the same idea Koselig \u2013 so in a way, Doppler is more on trend today than it was when it was released in 2010. Still, I can't imagine preferring to spend a Northern winter sleeping in a tent in the snow \u2013 even with a warm moose as a pillow \u2013 as a rejection of society unless this really is meant to be a result of lingering brain damage. Taken less literally, this is an interesting (if fairly gentle) insider critique of Norwegian society, and it's worth reading for that. And also for the solid feeling of the little book in your hands with the adorable moosehead graphic on the cover; there's definitely a cosiness to that..", "Worst $12 I've ever spent on a best seller/award winning book!

Then one day, after a bicycle accident he decides to suspend his regular life for a while and move to the forest surrounding Oslo, in order to stop being a smart-ass, to avoid communication with people and to bring the art of idleness to perfection. However, his solitude is not unperturbed: Doppler finds himself in the company of the young moose, Bongo, the scale-modeling D\u00fcsseldorf, his cartoon-junkie son, Gregus, and others, which leads to all kinds of complications.The novel abounds in extremely funny episodes, grotesque events, and hilariously amusing and self-ironic meditations on the bad effects of TV, the ubiquity of popular culture or the harmful consequences of being a wise-guy.Judging from the beginning and the general topic of the novel, Doppler could easily have been a moralizing, gloomy and cynically told story which wants to hammer in a lot of serious truths. Fortunately, Doppler is everything but this. Rather, it is a totally entertaining read and no matter how many times I re-read it, I laugh through the book from the beginning to the end.Of course Doppler also contains a lot of social criticism, talks about the possible emptiness of human relationships and refers to the dark historical background of some of the characters, however, I never felt it to be a distressing work, thanks to the style and self-irony of its anti-hero. Doppler does not take himself seriously for a minute and does not pretend to be the only person in the world who knows the road to wisdom and salvation. On the contrary, he admits that he cannot and does not want to be anyone\u2019s spiritual guide, since his own move to the forest was only due to a lucky coincidence.Doppler does not want to convert anybody to his lifestyle, on the contrary, he would prefer if everybody stayed at home or kept to the beaten tracks in the forest, and let him peacefully carve his monument for his father, play memory games with Bongo or simply do nothing. And to preserve his quiet way of life, Doppler can even become violent or start to casually threaten other people with violence. So it seems that despite the apparent similarity, Doppler is not exactly a mild, Thoreau-like figure camping out at Walden Pond and peacefully contemplating the beauty of forest animals or bean-cultivation, and in the meantime showing everyone the wonders of simple life and the possibilities lying in passive resistance. Instead, he is the cynical, witty product of modern life who would like to get out of the grasps of civilization, but is only able to do this partially and for a short period, as civilization follows him to the forest, and he cannot cut himself loose from it either, as he is dependent on some of its products (such as low-fat milk).It is of course possible to interpret Doppler\u2019s failure to create an alternative life in the forest as something tragic, and it is also possible to think that it really must be an awful world where individual values and efforts are doomed to failure, as no-one can get out of civilization completely, however, Doppler is much too ironic and entertaining a novel and I do not think it should be spoiled by too much moralizing and gloomy thoughts. As I already mentioned, Doppler does not take himself seriously, so I never take him too seriously or consider him an example to follow either. This is a very amusing novel, so the best I can do is to be amused by it. So I do that, again and again..", "This is exactly the kind of breakdown I imagine myself one day having.", "Did a bonk on the head drive Doppler mad, or knock some sense into him?

In his mad/genius way, Doppler even names the moose calf after his father: \"I'll call the calf Bongo after my father, I decide as I'm strolling back into the forest. Even though my father wasn't called Bongo I'll name the calf Bongo after him.\" His father was present, but absent. Does Doppler absent himself from his family to be more present for them?Doppler sees \"niceness\" as a sickness and advocates a return to a barter economy. From his newly adopted home in the woods he looks down in Grinch style on the lives of people below: \"One problem with people is that as soon as they fill a space it's them you see and not the space. Large, desolate landscapes stop being large, desolate landscapes once they have people in them. They define what the eye sees. . . . In this way an illusion is created that humans are more important than those things on earth which are not human.

As a side note, I also enjoy the existence of penguins and giraffes, but unfortunately don't live in the latitudes where either could be spotted.

This of course wouldn't do if you are Erlend Loe and wanted to write a book about Andreas, so we might as well make Doppler hit his head during his chic bike trip around the nearby forests, and make him feel like maybe he should move to live right there.And move right there Doppler does. He leaves the whole deal, packs up his tent and whatever basic equipment you want to live in a forest, and to much of surprise to many, actually stays there. Turns out a man cannot be alone in a forest for too long, but unlike that prick in Naive. Super, this time Loe gives our hero a companion with some character: an elk, baby! Yes!Doppler is underneath its light entertainment value a pretty heavily society criticizing book. You can expect the book to make you laugh just as much as any Loe piece, but reading Doppler actually makes you think is all this is a bit too much. This wouldn't happen when reading Naive. Super for instance, but Doppler goes on to think that all of humanity is actually quite rotten. For me this thinking goes too far. I can relate to the repulsion towards the human society to some extend, but at the end of the day the conclusion of this book made me feel a little bit of unrest.If you are capable of not taking these things too seriously (as I would love to), Doppler seems just as good a read as any Loe piece..", "Amusingly frank, satirical account of an individual's attempt to withdraw from the inanity and the humdrum routine of modern urban lifestyle.In our narrator's voice and manner I kept sensing familiar flavors: the cynical, consumer culture damning anarchism reminiscent of Chuck Palahniuk's most famed work.

The Peregrine, first published in 1967, reads as the diary he kept during that period but may include observations made over the course of the many other winters which Baker spent following the movements of these birds. It is important to point out from the beginning that even though this book is at first glance simply the diary of a bird watcher, it is also a novel with characters, setting, plot and suspense, and therefore any liberties Baker takes with chronology, weather and sightings, are perfectly in order. Having said that, this novel is presented exactly like a diary with entries only for those days he spends following the peregrines. He never tells us what he does on the other days, or how he spends his evenings, no personal details are included, all of the focus being reserved for the birds and the landscape. The only explanation he gives for this obsession with bird watching is when he says:I have always longed to be part of the outward life, to be out there at the edge of things, to let the human taint wash away in emptiness and silence as the fox sloughs his smell into the cold unworldliness of water; to return to the town as a stranger. Doesn\u2019t the repetition of descriptions of birds and landscape become terribly tedious after a while, you may ask? I can only reply that Baker succeeds in capturing our interest with the variety of the daily movements of the birds and the amazingly creative language of the descriptions. Here is an example of his prose:The first bird I searched for was the nightjar, which used to nest in the valley. Its song is like the sound of a stream of wine spilling from a height into a deep and booming cask. It is an odorous sound, with a bouquet that rises to the sky. In the glare of day it would seem thinner and drier, but dusk mellows it and gives it vintage. If a song could smell, this song would smell of crushed grapes and almonds and dark wood. The sound spills out, and none of it is lost. The whole wood brims with it. Then it stops. Suddenly, unexpectedly. But the ear hears it still, a prolonged and fading echo, draining and winding out among the surrounding trees.Elsewhere, he speaks of a crackling blackness of jackdaws, of hiding in my own stillness, of the soaring of the peregrines being an endless silent singing. As the title suggests, the novel is mainly about peregrines and we learn that they belong to the hawk family, that the males are called tiercels and the females are falcons, that they resemble kestrels and sparrow hawks but are faster, more intelligent and more deadly. Whatever is destroyed, the act of destruction doesn't vary very much, Baker tells us, speaking no doubt not only of these raptors but also of man and his relationship with the earth; there is an environmental subtext, man is destroying the landscape, in particular with pesticide use, and birds and animals are losing their habitats and being slowly poisoned. Nevertheless, Baker doesn\u2019t glorify the hawks or seek to excuse their violence towards their prey. He does point out however that they kill their victims almost immediately with an efficient strike to the spinal cord, not for humane reasons but simply to prevent escape.Surely it is impossible that there can be any measure of suspense in a bird watcher\u2019s diary, I hear you say. Nevertheless there is a plot here, and it keeps us reading until the final pages when we understand the outcome of the story. I leave it to you to discover how Baker achieves this magic..", "This is just the most wonderfully poetic account of one man's year long exploration of the lifestyle of peregrines in the unnamed yet I assumed East Anglian area of the mid 1960's.

He does stray on a number of occasions into prose so purple a whole college of Bishops could dress themselves in it but there are so many breathtaking phrases that I could forgive him the odd clanger dropped. Whenever I read these nature books from decades ago there is always the sad realization that so much of the rural idyll has been lost forever; eg. The number of times he mentions towering Elms which grace the countryside, all now dead and gone after the tragedy of Dutch Elm Disease in the early 1970's. However for me there is also the joyous realization that his dread that peregrines themselves were a dying breed has been stopped in its tracks. Peregrines may not be as common as Buzzards but they still thrive and hunt and are still here to be enjoyed 40 years on. A selection picked at random from the pages...you judge purple or perfect;'Their wings would rise into the sunset like smoke above the sacrifice'or again ' Beauty is vapour from the pit of death '...no I have no idea but it sounds like an aphorism in the makingor again ' the peregrine hissed among them like a burning brand 'or again ' She clings to the rippling fleece of the earth as the leaping hare cleaves to the wind'There are loads more.

But then you learn this:Wild peregrines love the wind, as otters love water. It is their element. Only within it do they truly live. All wild peregrines I have seen have flown longer and higher and further in a gale than at any other time. They avoid it only when bathing and sleeping.I was taught more:-- Female peregrines are falcons. Male peregrines are tiercels. Falcons are bigger than tiercels, and broader across the chest.-- While the author did not specifically make a point of this, there are many descriptive passages where one falcon and one tiercel are playing/hunting/soaring together. Not in a group; just a couple. I liked that.-- An adult peregrine is about the size of my arm from elbow to fingertips. But a peregrine's eye weighs about one ounce, larger and heavier than the human eye. If our eyes were in the same proportion to our bodies as the peregrine's are to his, a twelve stone man would have eyes three inches across, weighing four pounds. -- Peregrines bathe daily, preferring running water. It helps them with their lice problems.-- In a typical day, a peregrine will kill and eat two birds as well as assorted mice, worms and insects.Well, actually, they aren't picky; and the author was fairly obsessed with recording the detritus:-- found the remains of a great crested grebe . . . It had been a heavy bird . . . The breast bone and ribs were bare. The vertebrae of the long neck had been carefully cleaned.-- Two kills by the river: kingfisher and snipe. The snipe lay half-submerged in flooded grass, cryptic even in death. The kingfisher shone in the mud at the river's edge, like a brilliant eye. He was tattered with blood, stained with the blood-red colour of his stumpy legs . . .-- The remains of a herring gull lay at the roadside . . . The shredded flesh was still wet with blood . . .-- There were kills by the brook: curlew, lapwing, woodpigeon, jackdaw, and two black-headed gulls.-- two dead herons-- the remains of a hare-- the body of a carrion crow . . . black feathers wreathed in bloodstained bones . . .-- a woodcock rises . . . bones snap . . .-- a shelduck lay on the mud, shining like a broken vase . . .-- he caught and ate six worms-- I saw him afterwards (an erstwhile sparrowhawk). He had been an adult male. His grey wings lay like flakes of beech bark beside the peeled willow of his shining yellow bones and the sunset feathers of his tigered breast.Descriptive dinner is on every page.But then there was this:At one o'clock a pipistrelle flittered above the lane, twisting and diving as though catching insects. None could be flying on so cold a day. Perhaps it had been roused by the sunlight, and was hunting in a dream of summer.I was happy that there was no pipistrelle autopsy report.The same can not be said for the dead porpoise, even though not killed by any peregrine. Its mouth hung open like a nail-studded sole gaping from an old boot.The author is the only human identified in the book and he does not self-dissect. But he's not happy. We learn this not when he is following the peregrine but instead when he watches a seal at play:Eventually the dark, whiskered muzzle of a seal appeared above the surface, and then the whole sleek streaming head. He looked at me, breathed in, and dived below. Slowly he splashed and idled around the bay and out to the estuary again. It is a good life, a seal's, here in these shallow waters. Like the lives of so many air and water creatures, it seems a better one than ours. We have no element. Nothing sustains us when we fall..", "The writing is exceptional.

All in all, it wasn't amazing or even very good, and so it must be given three stars.It is extremely difficult to listen to hours and hours of lines that say approximately the same thing, even if those lines are lyrical. The content is repetitive. Day by day we follow Baker as he walks and bicycles a small patch of land, ten miles north to south and twenty miles east to west in Essex, observing peregrines. We start in early fall and conclude in late spring. Each chapter begins with a date. We are told what he saw and experienced that day, and the next and the next and the next. Each day is much like the last. The seasons do change and Baker does come closer both physically and emotionally to that he observes. The peregrines' movements become a dance, lovely to observe and emotionally feel, but nevertheless monotonous in the lack of change. Every day an awakening, play, a hunt and the kill.I listened to the 50th Anniversary Edition of the Peregrine. It begins with an introduction by Mark Cocker which is then followed by biographical notes. Finally, we get to Baker\u2019s writing. Baker\u2019s lines are followed by an afterword by Robert Macfarlane which is then followed by Baker\u2019s short essay On the Essex Coast. There is a lot of padding. The supplementary material is not exclusive; too much of the information said in one section is repeated in another. The biographical information provided is scanty and repetitive, due to the manner in which the 50th Anniversary Edition has been put together.The audiobook is narrated by Dugald Bruce-Lockhart. He reads too quickly. Should poetry be zipped through? I do not think so. The narration I have given two stars.It should be noted that Baker observed peregrines over a ten-year period. He observed and every night returned home to transcribe his notes. He rewrote the book five times and condensed his observations to one year. So even if we are given a date, we do not know in which year that date fell, and thus the observations made are not necessarily in chronological order even if we do move from fall to spring. I do not doubt the veracity of the observations made. Yet one does not read Baker\u2019s writing for its scientific content, or at least not only for its scientific content. We have here writing that goes beyond the study of the peregrine as a species. Baker has attempted to capture the nature, the existence, indeed the soul of the bird.

The fact of the matter is that it can be a bit boring after a while to, say, watch a robin hunt worms. And trees do not even give you that much. Nature writers have risen to this challenge in a variety of ways\u2014by providing illuminating scientific analyses, by finding truly bizarre and obscure examples of natural phenomena, by telling heartwarming or otherwise anthropomorphizing stories about particular animals, or by poetic description and romantic reverie. Baker takes the last route. The Peregrine consists of two parts: a short, scientific description of this predatory bird, and a longer diary of his experience tracking the peregrine falcons in his area of rural England. Baker takes quite a lot of literary liberties with this diary. For one thing, he compresses ten years of observation into a single season. And the language is nothing like plain, factual notes. Rather, this work of birdwatching becomes a strange kind of lyrical poem, rhapsodizing the painful longings of a frail man to become fully natural and to fly free. The book\u2019s merit, then, must be judged on aesthetic rather than informational grounds. And Baker succeeds. His prose is dense with images and heavy-laden with similes. He twists words into thick knots as he tries to convey the near-mystical intensity of his visions. The dominant emotion is one of desolution and despair. The emptiness of the landscape mirrors a kind of inner emptiness, and his fascination for the peregrine becomes an expression of a deep yearning for a richer, fuller life. It is rather sad. I do have to admit, however, that I found the emotional register of this book to be monotonous, and the prose to be overwrought. There is not really any emotional or tonal contrast to speak of, which makes it difficult to read the book for long spells. I was fortunate, however, to have listened to an audiobook version narrated by David Attenborough, who livened up the experience somewhat. And I do have to admit that the book had an effect on me, since I went on my first birdwatching expedition (to a park) shortly after finishing it..", "Bird.", "I read an article about this book recently, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its publication. https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...The book is every bit as stunning as the article suggests.

The book is the result of 10 years of observation, distilled into one period from autumn, through winter and into spring.Baker's writing is exquisite and on nearly every page there are phrases and sometimes whole paragraphs that make the reader stop at their beauty:\"Greenshanks stood in the marsh; hoary-looking waders, grey and mossy-coloured, tilting forward to feed over their thin grey legs. Where they were not grey, they were white; bleak, leaden birds, phantoms of summer green, suddenly aloof and beautiful in flight. Slow rain fell from mid-grey, light grey sky. A deceptive clarity and brightening at eleven o'clock meant that the rain was really setting in. For an hour, till greyness covered all, the water shone like milk and mother-of-pearl. The sea breathed quietly, like a sleeping dog.\"Here is his description of the Peregrine's flight:\"He flowed across the dazzling sky in one great slash of light, and flared out into the darkness of the trees.\"And another passage observing the bird:\"He flew south, moving like a sleepwalker, gazing forward enrapt.

Something about remote landscapes and the creatures which inhabit them invoke an ethereal experience which is both personal and mysterious. My second reading of this ageless book, which won the Duff Cooper Prize in 1967, confirms to me that this is a work of genius. Many leading critics have thought so too: Robert Macfarlane deemed it to be \"a masterpiece of twentieth-century non-fiction\" in his introduction to the New York Review Books edition of the book. On the back jacket cover of the same edition, James Dickey states that the book \"transcends any 'nature writing' of our time,\" while Barry Lopez declares the book to be \"one of the most beautifully written, carefully observed and evocative wildlife accounts I have ever read.\" Werner Herzog called it the \"one book I would ask you to read if you want to make films.\"The genesis of the book came about from the author's ten-year obsession with the peregrines that wintered near his home in Chelmsford, Essex and recounts a single year from October to April 1962/3. The writing is lyrically charged throughout, as the author's role of diligent observer gives way to a personal transformation, as Baker becomes, in the words of James Dickey on the book's jacket cover, \"a fusion of man and bird.\" There are times in the narrative when the interchangeability of Baker and the object of his desire are indistinguishable - Baker becomes the Peregrine, he feels its struggles and lives its joys. I think part of the success of the book stems from the fact that Baker was an ascetic, he lived as a wild animal might, instinctively, without many of the trappings of a materialistic society. The Peregrine was for him a paradigm of the way he wanted to be - free and unencumbered. This is reflected in the prose style - precise, perceptive yet elegiac, elegant and above all, beautiful - this is a book where beauty abounds, and with a style resonant of Richard Jefferies and Edward Thomas at their best. Baker's only other book is 'The Hill of Summer' (1969), a lyrical and somewhat visionary account of summer's progress across the wilder parts of southern England.If you never buy another book on Nature and Landscape buy this, it has been the benchmark for all who aspire to such writing from the moment it came out.   .", "Peregrines are one of the most impressive apex predators in this country, but it is one that we almost lost because of pesticides and persecution.

Two things saved them, the banning of pesticides and they moved from the rural to the urban environment, skyscrapers replacing the cliff top eyries. Half a century ago, J.A. Baker first published this book on these magnificent birds. The book is written as a diary, with him following on foot and bicycle a tiercel and a falcon pair over the winter over the fields and fens of Essex, he would note on his OS maps when he saw them, the prey that they had caught, and general notes on the weather and sky. What started as a fascination with all of the raptors in the region, rapidly became a passion before becoming a complete obsession. He learnt the peregrines habits, sought out their roosts and before long his knowledge of them grew to become an innate ability to know where and when they would appear. This is the second time I have read The Peregrine, the first time was back in 2011. Since then I have managed to work my way through an awful lot of natural history books by a lot of authors, a lot of which have been good, all the authors have been passionate about their chosen subject, but none have had that obsession that Baker has. What also strikes me about this book though, is just how sharp it still is, Baker writes with brevity, precision and a style that is quite unique and uncompromising. It pulls no punches either, this in not a sanitised volume on the grace and power of the raptor, you will hear a lot about the remains of their meals is all the gory detail. What you do get though is an observer who completely understands his subject describing that moment when they stop soaring about the fens and start the hunt to the sheer adrenaline of the stoop. It is a snapshot of the time when the peregrine was on the edge of the abyss, somewhat abated now, but not completely safe.

Books written about nature - and by people who appreciate nature, such as birdwatchers - reward more those interested in aesthetic and emotive experiences; those who have developed a poetic sensibility and a quality of attentiveness that allows them to be fascinated by minutiae; people who could stand for thirty minutes and look at a bird laying dead on the ground, and analyze it, think about it, appreciate the beauty and destruction, all without getting bored or asking how, in the grand scheme of things, that experience is important in their lives. I am, to my detriment, not one of these people, so I know that I did this book a disservice.Nevertheless, the foreword and afterword, and Baker\u2019s own introduction, provided some context for someone like me. They made it possible for me to at least understand where the book was coming from even if, in the end, I would not end up being as great a fan of it as it seems everyone else I know who has read it is. In 1940, the British government issued an edict that all \u201cperegrine falcons\u201d were to be killed (as I have learned from Baker, the taxonomy is complicated: Peregrines belong to the Falcon genus, so all peregrines are technically falcons, but within the birding community, only female hawks are known as \u201cfalcons\u201d - male peregrines are called \u201ctiercels\u201d). The reason was that peregrines hunted and killed particular kinds of homing pigeons, and pigeons were absolutely necessary in the war effort against the Nazis since, whenever tech failed, they were what were relied on to pass messages. To continue the decimation of peregrines in England, the profusion of agrochemicals, most notably DDT, in the 1950s, when Baker\u2019s fascination with birding began, meant that if things continued that way, peregrines would soon have become extinct in England. As Baker says at the beginning of his writing, \u201cFor ten years I followed the peregrine. I was possessed by it. It was a grail to me. Now it has gone. The long pursuit is over. Few peregrines are left, there will be fewer, they may not survive. Many die on their backs, clutching insanely at the sky in their last convulsions, withered and burnt away by the filthy, insidious pollen of farm chemicals\u201d. The purpose of Baker\u2019s book, as he saw it then, was, before it was too late, to try to \u201c recapture the extraordinary beauty of this bird and to convey the wonder of the land he lived in, a land to me as profuse and glorious as Africa. It is a dying world, like Mars, but glowing still.\u201dA few facts about peregrines: The peregrine is the fastest animal in existence (that we know of): it\u2019s stoop (or swoop - they mean the same thing), a high speed dive, usually while hunting, can reach 320 km per hour. Peregrines have some of the most powerful eyesight of any animal. Peregrines exhibit sexual dimorphism, with female falcons being larger and heavier than male tiercels. Peregrines eat mostly medium sized birds, but they are not particularly discerning in their tastes. For peregrines, the more available a particular species of medium sized bird is, the more commonly that bird will be eaten. Per Baker\u2019s observations, the most common prey for peregrines include woodpigeons, black-headed gulls, lapwings, wigeons, partridges, fieldfare, moorhens, curlews, golden plovers, rooks, waders, ducks and corvids. Most of the peregrine\u2019s day is spent hunting or sleeping. But they\u2019ll also set aside time for a bath, every single day. When bathing, they showcase a preference for small ponds and shallow brooks, with undergrowth that somewhat resembles their feathers, providing some camouflage.Peregrines are understandably naturally averse to humans. To successfully watch them then, humans have to blend in as much as possible. Baker says that to successfully watch them over the ten years that he did, he had to imitate the hawk so much as to basically become it; to almost quit being a man - \u201cI was imitating the movements of a hawk, as in some primitive ritual; the hunter becoming the thing he hunts. I looked into the wood. In a lair of shadow the peregrine was crouching, watching me, gripping the neck of a dead branch. We live, in these days in the open, the same ecstatic fearful life. We shun men. We hate their suddenly uplifted arms, the insanity of their flailing gestures, their erratic scissoring gait, their aimless stumbling ways, the tombstone whiteness of their faces.\u201dI think, what kept me going till I finished this book, despite it not being the kind of book I would usually read, was just Baker\u2019s writing. It was, in every line, poetry masquerading as prose! It was violent but beautiful; precise yet affecting in a literary sense; descriptive yet also somehow metaphorical. Whenever he described a hawk or its kill, the Essex countryside, an owl he came across, my mind could\u2019t help it; it conjured what I imagine to be the very precise image he was talking about. At the same time it extended to something grander, almost a witnessing of the magnitude of nature. And when he was not being vivid in his descriptions, he was being reflective in a way that was just as image provoking. Here, for example, is how he describes how he came to be a birder: \u201c\u201cI came late to the love of birds. For years I saw them only as a tremor at the edge of vision. They know suffering and joy in simple states not possible for us. Their lives quicken and warm to a pulse our hearts can never reach. They race to oblivion. They are old before we have finished growing.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t issue a wholesale recommendation of this book. But for a particular person (unalike myself) - the poet, the contemplative person; someone who can nurse a thought, an emotion, a sensation, an affecting sight for a while, and not be downgraded into levity, - this book might be one of the best things they read..", "Sometimes you read a book to find out \"what happened?\".

Othertimes, you read as a kind of immersion process, to sink into a realm not your own and abide its rules and orders. This book is definitely suited for the latter kind of reading. There is no real plot to this book; it is, like much lyric poetry, interested in the nowness of its subjects rather than in the progress of the reader's journey. This book really is more about the writer's relationship to nature in general and the peregrine in particular. Sometimes there's maybe too much fact, when it comes (do we really need the exact numbers of woodpigeons, lapwings and partridges killed by a peregrine in order to understand the bird's habits? Wouldn't a general nod in that direction suffice?), but from an immersion standpoint, we should be intrigued by even the grotesque and mundane necrology of birds who ignite the peregrine's hunting mind. The book is often pure, boring fieldwork, but it is cast in the most intense, devotional prose; the subject of the bird is lifted out of the mundane by its particulars, which Baker curatorially provides in scientifically accurate detail. \"He flew southward, rising: four light wing-beats and then a glide, an easy rhythym. Seen from below. his wings seemed to merely kink and straighten, kink and straighten, twitching in and out like a pulse. A crow chased him, and they zig-zagged together. As he rose higher, the hawk flew faster; but so light and deft was his wing flicker that he looked to be almost hovering, while the crow moved backwards and down.\" For bird lovers, this simple devotion to the peregrine may seem enough. For me, the more I can understand a creature the better. But this book is not built on my instruction; if follows the mind of the researcher by following the mind of the bird. In the end, it is really about the relationship between a researcher and his fascinating subject, and I find the book wonderful in its very limited world. I'd also recommend reading \"The Goshawk\" by T. H. White..", "I am aware of the Peregrine Falcon as the University of California Santa Cruz has a big Peregrine project to save the bird.

A wonderfully peculiar hybrid of field guide and travelog in which observation and obsession collide, it\u2019s a work of substance, captivation, and terror that far surpasses what one might expect from such a slim volume.Baker\u2019s stated purpose is to track a pair of peregrine falcons from Fall to Spring across eastern England. Patient and dogged, Baker details a vivid world that\u2019s seemingly void of humans and in which falcons are those that set everything in motion. Baker\u2019s kinship with the peregrines progressively deepens, eventually arriving at a point when he seems to slough off his humanness in an experience \u201cof proximity, of identification.\u201d (p. 138) Slowly but surely, he\u2019s acculturated into the hawks\u2019 terrain. Baker\u2019s appraisal of landscape, arguably as crucial to this work as the peregrines, is rendered in a clean, crisp, and compact prose that none-the-less possesses a high concentration of insight and import. The writing is deceptively lyrical, and, being equal parts pithy and potent, I found myself regularly revisiting passages in an effort to unpack deeper meanings and revel in Baker\u2019s stunningly evocative descriptions and deft wielding of metaphor. In regards to this expressive treatment of nature and, particularly, terrain, Cormac McCarthy\u2019s western landscapes may come to mind, but Baker is far more lucid and exacting, avoiding bombast and dealing instead in acuity and accuracy that, though simmering, are every bit as dramatic.This is a book to be savored and re-explored. It\u2019s a singular work, one that implies and implicates far more than is directly present in the text. It\u2019s about falcons, to be sure, but it\u2019s also about being human, being present, and being a part of something far larger than we often realize. .", "\"Near the brook a heron lay in frozen stubble.

But then a large part of the story centres around the Dunkirk evacuation from WW2 and unrequited love \u2013 military history and complex adult emotions aren\u2019t really things I\u2019d say pre-pubescent junior school kids would have any knowledge of. Unless it\u2019s not aimed at kids and it\u2019s supposed to be for teenagers and older? Except it looks like too much of a kid\u2019s book to appeal to any teens. I know when I was in high school, I only had eyes for books by Terry Pratchett, Stephen King and Douglas Adams, steering well clear of anything for kids. And adults? Would a 40ish page illustrated short story appeal to them, and would they be engaged with the thin story, one-dimensional characters and excessive sentimentality? Besides highlighting that there was an evacuation at Dunkirk in 1940, it doesn\u2019t provide any insight to the event. It\u2019s baffling, though I\u2019m an adult (technically anyway!) and I picked this up as I was told it\u2019s a classic. Except it\u2019s not. Neither Rhayader or Frith could be considered well-written, rounded, memorable characters in the least, and the story is extremely boring for the most part. It becomes mildly interesting \u2013 though incredibly far-fetched \u2013 once Rhayader and the snow goose take off in a skiff to the coast of Dunkirk to help ferry stranded British soldiers from the beach to the larger ships anchored nearby. But that little piece of fantasy doesn\u2019t really make this a classic. There\u2019s far too much mawkish sentimentality over unspoken love, and tragic and needless death, and so on, but it felt manipulative of the author rather than genuine. I wasn\u2019t saddened by the ending, I just wondered what the point of it was. It\u2019s much too brief a story to make you feel anything about any of the \u201ccharacters\u201d. I suppose kids might enjoy the book \u2013 it\u2019s not a challenging read, though I\u2019m not sure what a kid is going to get out of it. Older readers are likely to be unsatisfied with the brevity of the shallow tale. The Snow Goose, aka Hunchbacks Need Love Too, is a forgettable and trite short story that easily impressed romance fans or readers looking for sentiment for the sake of sentiment will enjoy..", "From BBC Radio 4 - Classical Serial - Neglected Classics:A wounded bird brings together a disfigured artist and a young girl and helps in a courageous act of bravery in World War II.Philip Rhayader .....

It is a story of natural beauty and the purest of bravery \u2013 a bravery when someone puts their own life at risk, for strangers, with no incentive of reward, renown or the duty. When the deed is done, simply because the help was desperately needed. When there is a choice \u2013 to turn away \u2013 or to act.The hero is Philip Rhayader, a lonely, ugly hunchback: \u201cPhysical deformity often breeds hatred of humanity in men. Rhayader did not hate; he loved very greatly, man, the animal kingdom, and all nature. His heart was filled with pity and understanding. He had mastered his handicap, but he could not master the rebuffs he suffered, due to his appearance. The thing that drove him into seclusion was his failure to find anywhere a return of the warmth that flowed from him.\u201d He lives in an isolated old lighthouse, where he has turned the grounds into a bird sanctuary, and he paints. One day, a young girl, Frith, brings him an injured snow goose, that has lost its way in storms, and has been shot by hunters. He nurses it back to health. The snow goose returns each year \u2013 and when it comes, so too does Frith.War breaks out. The British government pleads for anyone with a boat to sail to Dunkirk to rescue the stranded allied soldiers from the invading German forces.  \u201cMen are huddled on the beaches like hunted birds, Frith, like the wounded and hunted birds we used to find and bring to sanctuary. \u2026 They need help, my dear, as our wild creatures have needed help, and that is why I must go. It is something that I can do. Yes, I can. For once \u2013 for once I can be a man and play my part.\u201d So, Rhayader \u2013 who has never been given any reason to love his fellow man \u2013 heads to France to save who he can. The snow goose flying overhead.There are many tales of bravery from these few days at Dunkirk \u2013 this was the book introduced me to the events of 1940, and this story has been indelibly etched into my memory ever since. While the world watches in horror at the devastation and human suffering brought about by another invasion \u2013 this time of Ukraine \u2013 and the evacuation of millions of civilians from the battlegrounds, there are more and more acts of bravery and compassion. People in Poland, Moldova, Romania and many other countries \u2013 and even in Britain (despite the govt putting many obstacles in the way) \u2013 opening up their homes to the refugees. This book is a reminder \u2013 if we need one \u2013 that there are always shining lights in the middle of humanities darkest hours.Highly recommended to anyone, who has not yet read this inspirational and heart-breaking book..", "I never like sombre outcomes but most of this novel is very beautiful.

I remember reading this beautiful book when I was a child. It\u2019s the story of a young crippled man, a girl, and a snow goose in 1940s Essex, in the lead-up to World War II. It\u2019s a story of kindness and friendship, of the beauty of nature and our need to protect it, and of the importance of not judging by appearances. It is also a love story. Philip Rhavader is a hunchback, shunned by all, who looks after hurt and injured animals. He makes friends with a young girl named Fritha who brings him a snow goose to tend. As she grows into a beautiful young woman, he falls in love with her but cannot speak of what is in his heart. Then the Second World War breaks out, and Philip sails across to France to help rescue the thousands of soldiers stranded at Dunkirk.

Michael J. Seidlinger\u2019s re-visioning enters the anthropocene without apology or oxygen masks, and asks us to take the trip toward self discovery as if the self was moving particles. A kick-ass ride. A beautiful dismemberment.\u201d\u2013Lidia Yuknavitch, author of The Small Backs of Children\u201cWhen I was in high school, I read The Stranger in French. L\u2019\u00c9tranger. I was not an A student in French. Maybe a B. Minus. My accent was \u2018formidable!\u2019, my grammar and reading comprehension \u2018m\u00e9diocre\u2019. I never looked at that book again, in any language. Now I actually have read Michael Seidlinger\u2019s uniquely compelling The Strangest. Am I supposed to now go back read a book of a lesser superlative? This book not only lives up to its title, it does so with impeccable rhythm and a perfectly odd, discomfiting grace befitting of this tale of strangeness updated for our strange present.\u201d\u2013Elizabeth Crane, author of We Only Know So Much\u201cIf anyone at any time is in search of a novel that renders the dysphoria and fragmentation experienced by the first generation to live through social media, then he or she should begin with The Strangest. Like Camus, Seidlinger does not so much describe anomie as write from it; the result is a strangely resonant book that feels, above all else, honest.\u201d\u2013Will Chancellor, author of A Brave Man Seven Storeys Tall\u201cThe Strangest is a bold and stirring portrayal of the alienation of contemporary life, how technology amplifies our desire for approval and magnifies the horror of others\u2019 judgment.\u201d\u2013Sarah Gerard, author of Binary Star\u201cThe world that Michael J.

Not since Seidlinger\u2019s last book have I encountered the chilling terror of Paul Bowles and his dissonant, virtually toneless minimalism, nor the evisceration of contemporary life that Michel Houellebecq delivers, ruthless as a diamond with a broken heart. Camus himself, I think, would affirm this homage to his famous book, with a solemn nod, perhaps, and the crushing underfoot of his last cigarette. For myself, I\u2019m as nauseated as I am lifted, as redeemed as appalled. If you want a vision of life without a soul yoked to one of ways to smash it, step into this void. The lesson is relatively short, but its benefits are sure to go on and on.\u201d\u2013D. Foy, author of Made to Break", "reviews": ["Oh deaaaaarrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!

But then, that\u2019s what he does in his preferred reality, in front of his screens. There too, he keeps count: how many followers, Likes, reposts? If this sounds comic, it should. Seidlinger keeps up a poker-faced social critique through the novel\u2019s first half, since after all, the surrogate life online exerts a powerful gravitational pull on us all. About halfway through the book, however, Seidlinger sets the same steep challenge as Camus, forcing his man to confront our flesh-and-blood limits. Under circumstances themselves murky, in scary company, Meurks finds himself goaded to murder. Through these passages the novel suffers a bit from its deliberate lack of ordinary psychology or sensual data; the threat to Meurks remains sketchy, as does the look of the corpse. After that, however, the former social-media addict winds up in world as denatured as the one he used to find only on the internet, namely, Death Row.

Seidlinger is well aware of his antihero\u2019s outsiderness. He updates that ennui by setting the first half of his novel, THE STRANGEST (not an attempt to outdo Camus, as much as dialog with him), online. His narrator is out of place in the physical world, but on social platforms he has a voice and a forum to express himself. He is constantly online, with his phone an extension of his body and his eyes glued to the screen as the action unfolds around him. It\u2019s a good analogy to support the absurdity of our existence today, no different than in Camus\u2019 time, just illustrated anew. By the second half of the novel, which loosely follows the plot of the original book, the narrator is even more alienated and alone, still posting but mentally, and we overhear his extended philosophical monologue.

Perhaps it really was a clever ploy of Seidlinger\u2019s to adapt The Stranger into a rewrite of our present day, using the classic tale as a prop on the stage of his focussed bombardment of electronic social media. Obviously, as one reviewer has put it, the author takes us into the consciousness of a person so withdrawn that he must have some sort of social anxiety disorder. But only if we met him in person. The fact that the narrator insists on relying constantly on his computer and cell phone for much of his social interactions is commonly true for what we currently all readily observe both publicly and privately happening all around us these days. And as much as I despise this epidemic of bulgingly selfish gadgetry users, and as dangerous as the constantly mindless activity seems to me, I managed to trudge on through at least a page or two of this book each day. Of course it took me several weeks to finally end this begrudging practice. And not one day of it did I ever savor my renewing of my read. But I did hold out hope always for a better tomorrow, and a future revelation that this Seidlinger was really onto something novel in his book. Some reviewers have found his attempt to rewrite Camus impressive. As much as I animately cheer on the sidelines for every success a new writer can garner while attempting to make history and find meaning in their work, I doubt I will ever join in the lauding made by Seidlinger\u2019s camp. I just do not connect. And perhaps it is I who am too attuned to the character Meursault and his personal difference. His strangeness. If I were he, the last thing I would seek out would be more friends, even though they might as well be virtual. And today\u2019s internet generation seems to measure their individual worth in how many of them, or their likes, they can count as their own. Midway through the book the pace does pick up steam as the predictably woeful results begin to proceed from a series of events seemingly thrown into the text uncharted. And nothing newly introduced seemed true or relevant given the narrator\u2019s character of indifference to what occurs outside his sphere of obsessive electronic engagement. And though the book\u2019s gait advanced at midpoint in what could be ironically construed as double time, no sand remained which might have quickened my own sphere of delight.

Since my mother slept during the day, I had to be very quiet. I found that by being as silent as a church mouse I achieved about the most freedom a young lad could hope to obtain.  Books became my friends, and they were outwardly quiet companions, but inwardly sparked fires in my thought processes. I suppose I was lonely, more lonely when I tried to talk about books with the people I knew. It was like the excitement of finding a gold mine (books) only to discover that people preferred silver (television). Lucy Snowe, the heroine of Villette, is lonely; life whirls around her and occasionally spins her into a light that requires people to see her. She is uncomfortable, knowing she will be found lacking the qualities people admire most. She learns to live by observing others and most importantly to be quiet, to be the wallflower on the verge of participation, but never taking that tenuous step forward to join the fray. \"Day-dreams are delusions of the demon.\"Day dreams were truly dangerous delusions for Lucy Snowe. She could not afford dreams because she could not stand the disappointment in failure to achieve those dreams. Life had to be real for Lucy. The novel begins with Lucy in the care of the Bretton's, a distant relation. She is 14, and something, never explained in the novel, has happened to her family leaving her alone in the world under the care and kindness of strangers. The reality of her situation is that she has no dowry; she is not deemed attractive, and she has few opportunities to improve her position. As she comes of age she works as a helper to an elderly, rich woman who dies leaving her again without prospects. She makes the momentous decision to move to Villette, a fictional French city, without a job or any inkling of what will become of her. Through misadventure and a bit of luck she finds herself on the doorstep of Mme. Beck's boarding school for young girls. A position is found for her teaching English to young, aristocratic girls. She is surrounded by rich people, and like a lot of wealthy people they don't understand poverty. She is asked why she teaches. \"Rather for the roof of shelter I am thus enabled to keep over my head; and for the comfort of mind it gives me to think that while I can work for myself, I am spared the pain of being a burden to anybody.\"Lucy Snowe could have presented herself as feeble, in need of care, and her relation would have certainly come forward to help her, but she chose to make her own way, and even though she elicits pity from her young, rich students, she is determined to be independent. I couldn't help but be impressed by her determination and pride in taking care of herself. Life dealt her few cards, but what few cards she had was enough to keep her from the clutches of poverty. Lucy Snowe falls in love with the dynamic Dr. John Graham Bretton, but he is in love with one of her beautiful students Ginevra Fanshawe. Lucy convinces him not only of the immaturity of his love, but the fallacies of Miss Fanshawe. He turns his attentions for a time to Lucy and starts to send her letters. Lucy knows this is too good to be true. \"Reason still whispered me, laying on my shoulder a withered hand, and frostily touching my ear with the chill blue lips of eld.\"Despite her best efforts Lucy can't help but hope for the fairy tale, and when Graham turns his attentions to another, she does feel the pain. The five precious letters that Graham wrote to her she symbolically buries in the bole of a tree so that she put them away from her and also keep them from the prying eyes of Mme Beck who is constantly going through the possessions of the teachers. Bronte LetterCharlotte Bronte became infatuated with a Belgian Professor and wrote him a series of love letters. He became incensed with this unsolicited attention and tore them to pieces. The professor's wife saved them from the trash and sewed them together for posterity. Here is an article giving a few more details. http://www.independent.ie/todays-pape... The wife, I can only assume, was a Bronte fan and may have been flattered that Charlotte found her husband attractive.I was rather shocked to find that Villette has not been hashed and rehashed by Hollywood. With all the films based on Jane Austen's work and on the works of the other Bronte sisters why has Villette been ignored? There was a five part mini-series back in the 1970s starring Judy Parfitt as Lucy Snowe. I couldn't find any usable stills from that series to include in my review. Netflix does not have the series available. I can only hope it has not been neglected and been allowed to disintegrateJudy ParfittThere was also a BBC radio production done in 1999 with Catherine McCormack supplying the voice of Lucy Snowe. Catherine McCormackVillette was published in 1853 and was the last novel published during her lifetime. Charlotte had finally married in 1854 and became pregnant almost immediately. She suffered from incessant nausea and frequent fainting spells. Charlotte died with her unborn child in 1855 just short of her 39th birthday. Photo of Charlotte Bronte circa 1854Charlotte Bronte explores the psychological implications of being an outsider. The anguish, the dashing of hope, the moments of despair, and yet the haunting specter of expectations keep Lucy attempting to achieve a life filled with love and happiness. She does, as the novel concludes, get an opportunity to fulfill her dreams and gain not only independence but a chance at love. \u201cHis mind was indeed my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I entered bliss.\u201d I have read that other reviewers felt the novel ended abruptly, and I too wanted more than just the sliver of explanation that was given at the end of the novel, but I think that has more to do with the way we feel about Lucy Snowe than it does about disappointment in Charlotte Bronte's plotting.

Obsessive reader as I am, I feel simply obligated to consume all kinds of reviews and discussions after finishing a book that left me in awe and baffled. This time I even ventured into the territory of critical analyses and interpretations. Many things came up during my quest to find out what people think of the heroine of Villette and the book as a whole - that this is a novel about a woman who fights to attain her independence, that Lucy Snowe is a liar, that almost all characters in the book - M. Paul, Pauline, Ginevre, Dr John - are representations of different sides of Lucy's (possibly schizophrenic) personality, that Villette is just a more depressing rehash of Jane Eyre, some other stuff that I don't even have a mental capacity to fully understand and reproduce here. But I am a simple person, for me Villette is a story of a woman who was severely traumatized by deaths of her family at a young age and who, being introverted by nature, under the pressure of her misfortunes closes herself to the outside world completely. Lucy's whole life purpose is to guard herself from possible heartbreaks, to create a facade of serenity and unfeeling. But the strength of her passionate nature, her vivid internal life are such that suppressing them is impossible. The entire book is Lucy's never ending struggle to keep up her walls, not to let anyone in, not to feel, not to hope, not to love, not to get attached, not to reveal her true self in its clever, opinionated, passionate, desiring, jealous, petty glory. Does the heroine attain her freedom in the end? Does she escape a prison of her self-imposed loneliness? Yes, she does, but not for long. The person who sees and loves Lucy the way she is, who helps her not only financially, but psychologically, is given and taken away. And once again, Lucy is guarded and telling us her story, never allowing herself and us to see the true extent of her despair, unhappiness, and loneliness. But even what is hinted at is heartbreaking.I loved this novel, loved it in spite of the numerous contrived coincidences, untranslated French dialog and sparse plot. Villette is a study of a woman's complex inner world and as such it is remarkable. However there is another (sort of voyeuristic) reason why the book affected me so much. It is claimed to be heavily autobiographical and I find myself intrigued by Charlotte Bront\u00eb. I want to know this woman. How much of the book was real? Did the extent of Charlotte's loneliness and desire to be loved matched Lucy's? Was M. Heger, her real life professor, just like M. Paul? Did he awaken her soul, played with her and then discarded her when the affair interfered with his married life? Was M. Heger's wife as manipulative as Madame Beck? Did Charlotte ever regret refusing several marriage proposals to instead pine over men utterly unattainable? Did she blame herself for her inability to be happy? Why didn't she allow Lucy her happy ending? Did she think financial security was the maximum a woman like her could ever hope for and love was impossible? I am off to try to find at least some answers to these questions....", "This book is better than Jane Eyre, guys. This is where Charlotte Bronte shows her real brilliance.

She doesn't tell us the lines we wish most to hear. She deals with feelings that should have fulsome paragaphs in oblique, obscuring half sentences. Fulsome paragraphs are written on subjects that one would not think of as half so important to a ladies' novel. The nature of God, the debate between Protestantism and Catholicism, Truth and Lies, the worst faults of humankind. These are all dealt with. She's also able to switch focuses, from far away observation, as if she is telling a fairy tale, to a prose that is close and intimately involved. Existentialist thoughts wind through here, religious rebellion against the existence of God, liberation of women.. a lot of things that a woman in 1853 probably shouldn't have been writing about.Lucy Snowe, the main character and narrator, has her faults. You will want to wring her neck. Not only for what she teases us with, but what she says. Her always forebearing attitude, her martyrdom. The sense of how impressed with herself she is at times, all her protestations to the contrary. Secretly holding herself rather above the company, to steal a line from another famous female. But let's also remember that Jane Eyre isn't all that likeable for most of the book either. Lucy is as difficult to like.The end is fascinating. To give away just a little bit of the book, she does not get the ending that one expects from Romantic books. The ending is a question mark. The reader can make of it what they will. She has no illusions, but we can have ours. Her happiness is completely different: solitary, alone, quiet... it provides a fascinating read though a feminist lens. I'd say the end has a bit of a message like 'A Room of One's Own,' but decades earlier, and with an appropriate veil. Interesting to note, the same male enabler is necessary, but it meets with a different end here.Happiness is not what one thinks it is. I really do have to warn that this novel is about repression and oppression and it reads like it too. The breaks out of this endless cycle are few and far between. It can be difficult to trudge through, as difficult as it is for Lucy to make it through. I made it by figuring out how Charlotte Bronte was playing with the reader, though. Pay attention to details. She will mention them and perhaps explain them chapters later, but not connect them for us. Victorian conventions are satirized gently and taken to task. I believe Charlotte Bronte is somewhat taking herself to task for believing the ridiculous things that women were encouraged to indulge in.... and I've just noticed that I wrote this review sounding rather like a silly victorian writer.

I still find it surprising in ways I could not have appreciated earlier, as if another layer of the narrative complexity were revealing itself. It seems logical to reread books an author has put through multiple drafts. If reading is a parallel act of creation, rereading is to contrast multiple impressions over time. Villette is my favorite Victorian novel. The story has a long fuse, but that\u2019s typical of its vintage. What is atypical\u2014and thrilling\u2014is the manner in which the author ceaselessly unravels the skein of character, never exhausting it. Just dazzling. Here\u2019s the romantic crux of the novel: Lucy Snowe is smart but not very attractive and she\u2019s mad about her godmother\u2019s son, Dr. John, who is enormously kind but really can\u2019t give her a second thought as a love interest. At the same time, as a friend of the family, Lucy\u2019s there to watch Dr. John pining after one woman, who\u2019s quickly shown to be a vicious flirt, and then another, more worthy of his attentions. Amid all this Lucy Snowe insists on remaining nice. By that I mean she is fair-minded to Dr. John\u2019s love interests, for she interacts with them in the everyday world, and despite her maddening solitude, will never turn bitter or vindictive. In fact, she\u2019s friends with them. This makes for dramatic tension that is through-the-roof! Neither will she natter at Dr. John and plague him with her emotions; she values him too much as a friend and intellectual equal. In the end it is this stability of character, despite her overwhelming and at times soul-crushing loneliness, that is Lucy\u2019s triumph. Though she will never see herself this way, the reader, whom she often exhorts by name, surely does. Then you have Lucy\u2019s encounters with the not-to-be-endured M. Paul, a fellow teacher in the girls\u2019 school, who seems to want to be the sole representative of all intellectual misogyny of his era\u2014c. 1830. He is snide, sneering, bitter, and jealous, with an overbearing opinion about everything, especially a woman\u2019s place in the world. He and Lucy are at a kind of constant verbal fisticuffs. We come to see him as the sad little punctilious man he is, as does the redoubtable Lucy, who is not snide or sneering or bitter, but who demands respect. Some of their exchanges become hilariously funny. Then we get M. Paul\u2019s horrendous backstory\u2014death of fianc\u00e9, stern Roman Catholic, etc\u2014and we see why he is what he is. Though not a priest, M. Paul has taken a vow of celibacy. No wonder he\u2019s so miserable! The way this tempestuous relationship contorts and resolves is a literary wonder. What a piece of shrewd insight is the indefatigable M.

Perhaps in large it does. The madwoman in the attic motif is repeated, this something that lodged in Bronte's imagination.Again the pathological sense of difference between the British and the French, more specifically between the Protestant and the Catholic. It is hard for me to know if this simply reflected the dominant social attitudes of British shortly after Catholic emancipation or the particular world of Haworth Parsonage, in particular the Irish background of father Bronte. An interesting result of this is that Bronte, or more accuracy her narrator, Lucy Snowe, comes across as a kind of Dostoevsky - a person who going abroad was energised by their immense dislike of foreigners. Escape aboard does not represent freedom, new perspectives, a new mode of living. Instead for much of the novel it is a kind of exile. I read in the introduction how the Brontes already as children had a passionate identification with the Duke of Wellington and liked to indulge themselves in violent fantasies involving the British army and horrible foreigners. I found it easy to go on to imagine Charlotte Bronte dressed as Britannia, but wielding a cat-o-nine-tails in place of the traditional trident, whipping her way through Belgium. With that firmly in mind the eventual relationship between Snowe and Monsieur Paul seems incredible, until I recall that Dostoevsky claimed that the two point on a circle, furtherest apart are almost the closest together, the intensity of her anti-foreigner feeling super charging her feelings for Monsieur Paul.This for me is the major difficultly in reading Villette. The narrative voice is extremely powerful, but does that mean that it is wise to take it as representing the authorial point of view, and if not quite, then where do we draw the line between Lucy Snowe and Charlotte Bronte? Despite her, in many ways quite narrow background and Tory attitudes Bronte did have a passionate relationship with a Catholic foreigner, and a married one at that, plainly something of that relationship is reworked in her presentation of attraction in both Jane Eyre and Villette - the male interest is not handsome in either case but he has a presence. Reading now the book says both something about the nature of relationships between men and women and between women and society (which is perhaps the same thing but writ large) as perceived by the woman from the Yorkshire parsonage.The first point is grooming, or slightly more nicely put seduction. We see in the opening chapters the young John seduce the even younger Paulina, and then put her aside once a more interesting option comes along in the shape of his school chums, and I imagine judging from those first conversations between Paulina and Lucy that something similar happened between Lucy and John too. This seduction method of relieving boredom is not unique to the men, Ginevra acts similarly towards the men that she is interested in. The key point for me is that the emotional investment is uneven, the pursuer is calculating, the pursued whole-heartedly engaged. This all seems masochistic to me, we have characters caught up in relationships from which they can only receive pain. Since they don't escape them we can only assume that they gain something meaningful from them. This is one of the difficulties for me reading the book - Lucy's sense of having any right to pleasure or satisfaction is so repressed that the reading experience became oppressive. Naturally in the context of the book this seems like a reasonable analysis, then again she is the narrator. The stories we tell about ourselves are traps as much as explanations or attempts at Enlightenment, the stories told by a first person narrator need to be felt through with a deeply critical eye.Despite this this gloom, Snowe is less oppressed by social status, she is relatively egalitarian in her outlook - a link between her and Monsieur Paul. Despite the police regime of the school, it is the internal oppression that is effective, not apparently the structure of society. That comes across as being something like a climbing frame, albeit one too crowded to have much opportunity to move. I might take the view that the internal oppression is so severe that the plan to open her own school is hidden from herself until late in the book, if less charitable, that Bronte hit on it as a solution late on in the writing process. Either way this is a book with sudden movements after periods of oppressive continuity, like ice that suddenly cracks.Snowe in that sense doesn't look like an accidental choice of name. If it suggests purity, it can also imply fragility, delicacy and cold. Despite which she endures unsnowlike through changes of the season down to the resigned, less than happy, more than unhappy ending, that Bronte manages to give her. An ending, on reflection, that offers more than Bronte's own.In any case, I sense a reread, and that a different review will emerge after that..", "I finished this last night and I'm STILL ANGRY.WHAT THE HELL, CHARLOTTE?I mean, seriously.

And WHY have so many of my friends given this book 5 stars?Now, as some of you may know, I love Jane Eyre. I mean, I LOVE JANE EYRE. It is without a doubt in my top ten books of all time. And I love it not because of the romance, but because I love Jane. Jane is not afraid to speak her mind. Jane is not afraid to seek out love. Jane is not afraid to say, I respect myself too damn much to be your mistress, even though you are a sexy beast and I want you. Jane is an artist. Jane is a loyal friend. Jane is amazeballs.Villette is about Lucy Snowe. Lucy Snowe doesn't talk a lot. Years worth of stuff happens to her and she goes, Meh, well, that was a thing. Lucy is easily irritated by people, and enjoys being alone (which I did appreciate), and Lucy is much put upon by people who sort of use her and abuse her, take advantage of her retiring nature, send her letters and buy her gowns when they remember her, drop her when they are busy with other people. Lucy likes walking around in gardens, and she's fine. Okay, sure. I was okay with all of this. It wasn't better than Jane Eyre, but it was okay.I was okay with it right up until she starts tearing out her hair and flinging herself around sobbing because a guy who has been a COMPLETE ASSHOLE to her for the last 400 pages is going away. A guy who constantly harps on her clothes, and tells her that she should wear dull colors and no jewelry because she isn't meant for such things. A guy who insults her intelligence, treats her like a child or a pet, spies on her, steals from her, mocks her in public. A guy who rages at her and calls her a slut for exchanging letters with a male friend. No. Just no. This man is the most horrible of all the horrible people who surround Lucy, and I am extremely upset that she didn't tell him not to let the door hit him on his (badly dressed, cigar-smelling) ass as he left.

No, jk, I don\u2019t have a weak and brooding constitution, but seriously, I may take to swooning and weeping soon enough if this crazy pendulum doesn\u2019t stop swinging so wildly.Villette was the uncannily similar variety of story. It is so eerie to read books from almost two hundred years ago and see my own thoughts and experiences. It is both comforting and totally exhausting \u2013 comforting because we have always been like this; exhausting because, well, we have always been like this. Bronte\u2019s description of Lucy waiting by the phone for a dude to call, or, in her case, by the door for a letter to arrive, is chilling. Lucy\u2019s conversation with Dr. John, when she points out the hypocrisy of his ability to see shallowness in men but not women, is absolutely hilarious. Lucy\u2019s delicacy about describing her own loneliness is beautiful. Charlotte Bronte writes a really killer antiheroine, and it is always easier to identify with an antiheroine than a heroine, I think, because it is easy to see our own flaws. While this book easily stands alone as a lovely study on humanity, it also evoked comparisons to Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice for me. It was the last book Bronte published before she died. As is so common, Villette, the later book, is a less tight story than Jane Eyre \u2013 it was more meandering, and where Bronte wants to dwell, she will dwell. In some ways, though, I think Villette is more successful than Jane Eyre in distinguishing antihero from hero because Bronte is kinder to the heroes in Villette and lets me feel a little bitter at them without really despising them here. Dr. John, in contrast to St. John, does not creep me out. Paulina is a traditionally heroic heroine. This works in Villette because it provides a more clear contrast between the traditional hero\u2019s story and Lucy\u2019s antiheroine story. On the other hand, Jane Eyre allows flaws in everyone, whether they are golden or dark, so that has a nice subtlety. At the same time that Jane and Rochester are the more clear antiheroes, St. John is so determined to crush feelings and be unhappy that he is not so much the golden hero as Dr. John. In Villette there is a clear line between hero and antihero; in Jane Eyre the line is more blurred, though the physical descriptions signal a distinction. It might not be useful, though, to compare the two books because they are both wonderful, and I don't know that I prefer the clear distinction or the blurring.In some ways, I think this story is a Bronte Pride and Prejudice. All of the couples are parallels: (view spoiler)[Paulina and Dr. John are Jane and Bingley; Lucy and M. Paul are Lizzy and Darcy; and, of course, Ginevra and de Hamal are Lydia and Wickham (hide spoiler)]. In many ways that comparison fails because the interaction of the characters in P&P forms a cohesive plot, and Villette is not really about any particular plot, I think, but it was interesting to see similar couples described through more brutal eyes. Both Charlotte and Emily Bronte, also, always seem more exotic than Austen because the aesthetics of their heroes are described so much more like an emo band. While Austen captures that subtle loneliness of unreliable family, the Brontes go straight for explicit isolation in a cruel world. I doubt I could love either Austen or the Brontes so much without the other. And it was beautiful to read about the couples from Pride and Prejudice with the severity and stifled animal cry of Charlotte Bronte. I see Virginia Woolf\u2019s point that sometimes Bronte\u2019s failures as an editor interfere with the story in a way that you don\u2019t see in Austen, but it is still beautiful.Probably my favorite thing about this book is Lucy\u2019s shiftiness as a narrator. This girl is going to tell you what she wants you to know and she is going to leave out whatever the fuck she wants. It was totally hilarious that she (view spoiler)[didn\u2019t even tell me that she knew the whole time that Dr. John was Graham Bretton (hide spoiler)]. That little minx! (As they say.) And then the way she ends the story is just (view spoiler)[heartbreaking \u2013 you can\u2019t even handle the cruelty of her life, so she won\u2019t force you to listen to it (hide spoiler)]. I was not in love with any of the heroes of this story, and I kind of liked that, too. It was more like a soul-mate friend, of whom I am completely in awe, telling me about the people she loved, and how she understood them and their faults, than a con game of trying to get me to fall in love myself. It is interesting because usually we are meant to fall in love with the romantic lead (and I\u2019mma be honest, I totally swoon for Rochester), but I do not almost ever swoon for my irl friends\u2019 love stories. In this way, I felt that Lucy was completely her own person, and even though I identified with her in this sometimes-creepy way, she was not a stand-in for me in the love story. I thought (view spoiler)[both Dr. John and M. Paul were kind of douchebags (hide spoiler)], but that was fine because Lucy was smart about all of them. Honestly, I didn\u2019t notice (view spoiler)[M. Paul (hide spoiler)] for a long time, and I am usually really good at picking up on romantic leads, so when I re-read I will have to pay better attention to what he does in the early part of the novel.I really loved this book. As I got to the end, I panicked a little because I remembered that I had always partly been reluctant to read it because I will use up the possibility for a new Bronte story soon, and what a sad, bleak time that will be. I still have a couple left, though, so I will hoard those for later.

Villette is darker and more realistic than Jane Eyre, and more autobiographical (and perhaps thus even more powerful). Drawing on Charlotte Bront\u00eb's experiences in Brussels, Villette tells the story of Lucy Snowe, who leaves England in flight from a shadowy, unhappy past; she comes to \"Villette\" (i.e., Brussels) and becomes an English teacher at Madame Beck's school, where she meets the mercurial, autocratic Monsieur Paul (based on Constantin Heger, the married schoolmaster with whom Charlotte fell in love during her time in Brussels).Lucy is a complex character: repressed, yet deeply emotional, cold on the outside (like her name), but fiery within. Her narration is reticent; unlike Jane Eyre, she holds back, never telling the reader everything, rarely allowing herself to show her feelings. A key passage occurs relatively early on the book, soon after Lucy has begun work at the school:\"Oh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I lived, little as I spoke, cold as I looked, when I thought of past days, I could feel. About the present, it was better to be stoical; about the future -- such a future as mine -- to be dead. And in catalepsy and a dead trance, I studiously held the quick of my nature.\"I do admit that Villette is not as easy to read as Jane Eyre. Lucy's reticence as a narrator forces the reader to reach out further to engage with her; yet her depth of feeling and her humor are engaging. I defy anyone (all right, anyone who likes Victorian fiction) to read fifty pages of Villette and be able to put it down; every time I read it, I feel as though I could pick it right back up after finishing, start it over, and be just as enthralled as though it had been years since I'd read it..", "No mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness.

What does such advice mean? Happiness is not a potato, to be planted in mould, and tilled with manure. Happiness is a glory shining far down upon us out of Heaven. She is a divine dew which the soul, on certain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the amaranth bloom and golden fruitage of Paradise.I love when this paradoxical life brings me a book laced with \"composite and contracted\" meaning, one of philosophical ponder and pathos; one wherein solitude grasps for Hope in order to avoid Despair and longing is elucidated and layered. Dreamlike and peculiar at times, a revelation of inner thought, the reflective narrative never ceases to make its reader consider life and its oddities, life and its happiness and pain. At a time in my life when I'm at a crossroads with two interesting professional decisions that were forced upon me by this life, I am humbled that Villette occupied my still moments.This is the story of what happens when a woman finds herself in the midst of a strange community, with aloof, pretentious, and judgmental people; when she must ground herself in an academic environment that overflows with pretenses and mockery. This novel's trajectory is what happens when love is unrequited, for it demands social status from the one it inhabits. These three meandering volumes make lucid the loneliness that blooms within, one that stems from loss of family and identity. I smiled when I read Bronte's explanation for Lucy Snowe because while I loved Polly, I had a deep admiration for Lucy's steadfastness and professional journey, and I also admired Charlotte Bront\u00eb who made no apologies for her character. Here is how Bront\u00eb describes Lucy in a letter:You say that she may be thought morbid and weak, unless the history of her life be more fully given. I consider that she is both morbid and weak at times; her character sets up no pretensions to unmixed strength, and anybody living her life would necessarily become morbid.And in a letter to her publisher Bront\u00eb wrote: \"I greatly apprehend, however, that the weakest character in the book is the one I aimed at making the most beautiful...\"I never really did understand, and in fact detested, Paul Emmanuel's patronizing ways in the first part of the novel. It was interesting to learn that he stands in for Constantin Heger, the husband of the school director that Bront\u00eb worked for. Graham, however, seems like a stud - caring, kind, generous, intelligent - and it is easy to see how Lucy would have fallen in love with him. However, to say much about plot would 'spoil' the story and mislead the reader, for this narrative is an extension of memory, a sequence of consciousness that occurs through contemplation and reflection, which makes the plot both surprising and revealing..", "\u201dHappiness is not a potato\u201d.

It has, after all, quite a reputation as a more accomplished novel and while I can see the reasons behind that, my heart will forever belong to Jane. But I must say that as heroines go, Miss Bronte threw me a bit of a curve ball with Lucy Snowe. In many ways, Lucy is more realistic than Jane: she is a lot more human and much less romantic, but she is also much more layered and complicated.Not that she is always pleasant, our Lucy: her story is one of disappointed hopes and abandonment issues. The people she cared for almost universally let her down, to the point where she simply has to assume no one cares. Every time she has let her guard down, she has regretted it bitterly. She is not traditionally attractive, has no fortune or prospects, is independent and proud\u2026 but pretty much left to fend for herself because she is surrounded by idiots. This is not an enviable position in that day and age, when having the effervescence of a Lizzie Bennett did more for you than having brains and a love of hard work. But there is a resilience to Lucy that commands respect: she puts one foot in front of the other, and she is genuinely happy when those she care for thrive.With no relations or money, Lucy packs her bag and leaves jolly old England for Villette (a thinly disguised Brussells), where she manages to get a job as an English teacher in an girls' school. Over a period of about a year, she will fall in love twice, be reunited with old relations and make unlikely friends. But mostly, she'll learn that she can't really let life be something that happens to her.I certainly related to Lucy more than I ever related to Jane, but she often rubbed me the wrong way. She doesn\u2019t make things easy for herself, both out of a exaggerated sense of honesty, but also because she doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered. Sometimes, I wanted to yell at her to just make a freaking effort already, but no, Miss Snowe is too smart to lower herself to play social games. Sigh!Bronte's prose is always fantastic, and if you are a fan of Jane looking for something similar, while the story is completely different, the writing is just as rich, the emotions just as strong and the characters just as unique..", "Reader, I heart Ms. Bronte!

Reading  Villette  was like reading a huge epic that I was so emmersed in that I walked in Lucy Snowe's shoes, I felt what she felt. How many authors can do that to you?Lucy Snowe is difficult to get to know at first. In fact, she is difficult to like. This is deliberate; she tells you about other people, what they think, what they feel, but precious little about herself, of whom she appears fiercely private. Only as the story unfolds does she start to let you in - I remember being surprised when she showed such tender, gentle thoughts and actions towards the sick daughter of her employer; that, I believe, was the first glimpse of emotion from Lucy and it really endeared me to her. Lucy Snowe's name was not an accident - Bronte toyed with Lucy Frost for a while before settling on Snowe. She also allows us to see her as others do:  \"Crabbed and crusty\"  said Ginevra, a pupil at the school, and  \"unfeeling thing that I was\"  written to her in a letter. The point is, she isn't unfeeling at all. She is lonely and trying to make her way in an unfamiliar world. Lucy's past is only hinted at but it appears to have been an unhappy one. Brontes prose is gorgeous,  Villette  is such a richly embroidered account of a young woman trying to make a life for herself in a foreign country and fighting for independence and friendship. This book isn't a romance in the same way that  Jane Eyre  is. I wasn't sure for a long time who the leading man would be (in fact he doesn't even appear until the second half of the book). And it isn't love at first sight, we watch it grow. I absolutely adored this book and it is now a firm favourtie of mine. I finished it last night and I finally closed the book in a daze. I don't want to give anything away, but I was  not  expecting what happended at the end at all. That came completely out of the blue for me.

Our persona is mature and respectable, for if we claim ourselves any manner of actor, in those appearances we reign supreme. Our countenance keeps us from harm, trouble, the majority of unwelcome intrusions and unexpected disturbances.Our face once feared the cruel judgment of every eye, and we will never know how much we have lost in maintaining its proud coldness.We of the reticent life and withdrawn days, the slow solitude and meandering existence, pray you keep at a distance.

Our modus operandi is an invisible seething, for if we name our most finely tuned instinct, it is the instantaneous measure of irony of any and all.

There are many similarities in the characters of Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe in that they are orphans, they are loners, they yearn for love and, for much of the book, they love from afar with no hope of reciprocation. Villette is a colder book because I believe Charlotte Bronte was trying to put her real life love behind her by writing it out. I think it was done out of sadness, depression and loneliness and she built a wall between herself, her characters and her readers.  There is such a thread of \"this doesn't really matter\" running through it that it is hard to become close to the characters or care very much about what happens to them. If they don't care, why should we? Villette also lacks the pace of Jane Eyre and plods through dreary days with long, boring musings and moralizing. I got weary of the sermons. It was as if Bronte wrote anything that came into her mind, avoiding the crux of the situation. When in Brussels, she fell in love with a married man, had no hope of ever having a life with him and returned home to Yorkshire alone and miserable. Then she tried to write a book with a \"so what\" attitude and that didn't work for me. I just checked the reviews posted before mine, and feel like a salmon swimming upstream.

I do think it provides more complexity in the storyline--in Jane Eyre, everything is more cut and dried. I felt that Jane Eyre is more forthcoming in her narrative--you know how she's feeling and what she's thinking. With Lucy Snow, you don't. She hides her feelings and opinions from the reader. She doesn't lie--she just chooses not to share. There is more ambiguity about whether her presentation of things is accurate or skewed by her perspective. There's definitely not as much drama as in Jane Eyre: no madwoman hidden in the attic, no escape in a thunderstorm (although Lucy does go through a weird, almost delusional experience at a Catholic church that lands her--with the same providential hand that guided Jane to her cousins' house--at her godmother's house to be tended), and no fire to remove the obstacle to her happiness at the end. The act of nature at the end of Villette, instead of removing the obstacles from Lucy's path, almost certainly destroy her happiness instead of ensuring it, but that is my opinion. It's definitely an ambiguous ending!I did very much enjoy this reading and love this book! As usual, my reading experience was enhanced by sharing it with the group, the Victorians! Highly recommended!Initial ReviewI'm not sure how to write a review for this book--I don't think I'm even qualified to. Yes, I read it, but not as well as it deserved. I went into it lightly, assuming that it was a weaker, watered-down, inferior version of Jane Eyre. By the end, I realized that this book is a force unto itself. The force of this book is subtle, though; it doesn't smack you between the eyes, but rather creeps up on you stealthily, winding almost invisible tentacles around your consciousness, catching you up into the story before you know you've been caught. Like its protagonist, Lucy Snowe, it lurks quietly, just watching; also like Lucy, the story has a hidden power.The story is the semi-autobiographical tale of Charlotte Bronte's unrequited love for her professor. The main character, Lucy Snowe, is an English orphan who flees England for the hope of adventure and a better life. She ends up in Villette, a fictional town that represents Brussels, where she takes a position in a girls' school as a teacher. She suffers an unrequited passion for one man, but ends by falling in love with another, who is ultimately a much better match for her.Lucy is telling the story, but we are still kept in the dark quite a bit as she proves to be an unreliable narrator. Her refusal to acknowledge certain truths about herself, even to herself, helps to keep her audience confused and mystified by events. All in all, I think this is a book that has hidden depths, and I feel that my own assumptions caused me to miss some of these layers of meaning. I need a re-read to really appreciate all that is there. When will that be? I have no idea, but I won't be able to do the book justice until then..", "This was a really beautiful journey which often left me puzzled, but in the end I absolutely loved it.

A lot readers will start Villette expecting a rehash of Jane Eyre\u2014a novel which I enjoyed but wasn't particularly taken by\u2014which is a pity given that the narrative of Villette takes its reader through a much more labyrinthine path that the straightforward Bildungsroman of Jane Eyre.  \u201cNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness. Happiness is not a potato, to be planted in mould, ant tilled with manure. Happiness is a glory shining far down upon us out of Heaven. She is a divine dew which the soul, on certain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the amaranth bloom and golden fruitage of Paradise.\u201d  From the first few chapters I fell in love with Villette.Bront\u00eb's writing is so insightful that it is hard not to highlight, or make a note of, every single paragraph. She has a way with words, managing to orchestrate long yet fluid phrases, that beautifully convey the many nuanced feelings and thoughts of her protagonist as well as the different landscapes she navigates. She offers her readers intricate and sharp observations, vivid descriptions, thoughtful asides and complex character studies that struck me for their realism.Villette's plot rests upon its narrator's interior struggle. In fact, this novel, is all about Lucy Snowe. A study of her psychology and of her shifting sense of self. Yet, even upon a third reading, she remains somewhat unknowable to me as she is careful to keep her feelings in check, and on more than one occasion she refrains from sharing certain knowledge with her readers (speaking of, there is an almost meta aspect to her narrative as she directly address readers and refers to scenes occurred in previous 'chapters'). Her self-division \u201cOh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I lived, little as I spoke, cold as I looked, when I thought of past days, I could feel. About the present, it was better to be stoical; about the future\u2013such as a future as mine\u2013to be dead.\u201d Her unreliability seems a natural outcome of her not wanting to reveal herself completely to us and others, and perhaps by lying to her readers, she can also deceive herself. We never know why she has become so alienated from her feelings but given that even as a child she was self-possessed and quiet observer, it seems that it is merely an aspect of who she is. This divide between duty and self-fulfilment, reason and feeling, is the main focus of the narrative. Bront\u00eb\u2019s Lucy, similarly to her more famous literary sister Jane, is a woman living on the social margins of her society: an orphan with few living relations and or friends, she lacks conventional beauty and the wealth necessary to be respected by society.Lucy minimises the loss of her family, not wanting to dwell on how this affected her nor on the difficulties she experienced as an orphan, dismissing that period of her life as \u201ca long time\u2014of cold, of danger, of contention\u201d. Her hardships go unheard since \u201cto whom could [she] complain?\u201d and so she grows accustomed to solitude believing that \u201cthere remained no possibility of dependence on others\u201d . The narrative that follows will see her confronted with different forms of femininity and womanhood  which are often embodied in the women she meets in England and in Villette. \u201cWhen I looked, my inner self moved; my spirit shook its always-fettered wings half loose; I had a sudden feeling as if I, who had never yet truly lived, were at last about to taste life: in that morning my soul grew as fast as Jonah's gourd.\u201d One of my favourite scenes sees our narrator rejecting ideals of femininity in a museum. One painting features a Cleopatra-like figure whose sumptuous body makes our protagonist at ill at ease; the other one demonstrates the traditional life of woman: a young and demure bride, a wife and mother, and finally a widow. Lucy, in the course of this maze-like narrative will demonstrate a headstrong will in that in spite of the concealment of her feelings she remains true to her self. Her character is so real that I was inevitably drawn to feel what she felt: I wanted what she wanted, for I couldn't stand to see her unhappy.\u201cMy state of mind, and all accompanying circumstances, were just now such as most to favour the adoption of a new, resolute, and daring\u2013perhaps desperate\u2013line of action. I had nothing to lose. Unutterable loathing of a desolate existence past, forbade return. If I failed in what I now designed to undertake, who, save myself, would suffer? If I died far away from\u2013home, I was going to say, but I had no home\u2013from England, then, who would weep?\u201d The ending is ambiguous and somewhat open-ended yet those last bittersweet pages soften the story's final blow.The cast of characters is not necessarily likeable but I grew fond of them nonetheless, Lucy's banter with a certain professor and a rather spoiled pupil made for some truly entraining scenes. I appreciated how imperfect and sometimes idiosyncratic these characters were as these things made them all the more believable. This novel is a beautifully written character study that plays around with Gothic and Romantic elements. There is great character development, shifting dynamics between friends and acquaintances, a painfully concealed and unrequited first love, and a series of feverous experiences which blur the line between reality and fantasy...Villette is a compelling portrait of a woman's shifting individuality.DISCLAIMER: this novel is decidedly of its time so expect a lot of phrenological references (or viewing someone's physiognomy as indicative of their character), the majority of Catholics in this novel are definitely a wee bit fanatical, many annoying remarks\u2014usually by men, but sometimes by women as well\u2014regarding women (the weaker sex etc...), a major character owns a plantation in Guadeloupe and no one bats an eye about it (I definitely recommend Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy for those interested in postcolonial sort of retelling of Villette, it is a short but truly captivating read), people from France and Spain are often portrayed as 'other', even 'alien', and a little girl with learning disabilities is referred to as a 'cretin' and some other unpleasant terms. .", "I wonder what Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s project was, when she was writing this novel: the narrator is not unsympathetic, but she suspects the reader of being very much so.

Paul will be returned safely.What more to say.Actually I decided there is quite a lot more to say - reading Villette, and then attempting to respond to the whole, required me to consider - what exactly is the nature of a review?I think the basic response - is that I want everyone else to read and enjoy the book as much as I did, and then to contact me and tell me all the pieces they loved, hated, wanted to change, couldn't improve upon, how it related to them etc. etc. etc. If my followers experience different emotions, a different rationale then no problem - the point is to read and appreciate her, and also I think because she's one of the Very Best. The experience of reading Villette will ultimately give you a more referenced and perceptive vision from which to read other novels - be it from the 19th, 20th or 21st century, and certainly you can go back in time to - when the Novel begins - mid 18th century? Tristram Shandy - by Laurence Sterne. Any suggestions folks?So to Villette - Bronte is an intellectual writer - and she writes in the style of her contemporaries which require that your abilities as writer be constantly reaffirmed. To this end, the text is full of references - to the Bible, Old and New, Greek philosophers, contemporary, and notable greats, English History - and surprisingly to Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles published in 1891. If you are not familiar with these noteworthy tomes and other writers - then yes it can be off putting - but we have the esteemed Tony Tanner, (a Fellow of King's College Cambridge, and Reader) who provides the End Notes and an Introduction. Can anyone explain the Tess reference, considering Hardy didn't create her until - 38 years after Villette? Nevermind - the esteemed Tanner also translates the heavy use of conversational French - although I generally preferred my own, and only used his when I struggled with vocab. All of this can be a little intimidating - Do not be put off. Ms Bronte applied mid-19th century writerly style, mixed with her own and being a woman, she needed to establish her credentials not to mention maintain her assumed status as Currer Bell.If you're a Bible reader then you will love Bronte's references to the Holy Works - try this:Chapter 19: Note 8. (p.280) Nebuchadnezzar's hottest furnace: the miraculous deliverance of three Israelites from one of these furnaces, whither they had been despatched by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (for refusing to worship a golden image), converted the king forwith to Judaism. See Daniel, iii.The note refers to words spoken by M. Paul to Lucy - a comment on her integrity of character.Or try this:  Chapter 25: Note 4. (p.370) too solid flesh: the phrase is from the first line of Hamlet's first soliloquy: O! that this too solid flesh would melt, Thaw and resolve itself into a dew; (I, ii 129-30)This is Paulina referring to her dear Papa - M. Home de Bassompierre as being immutable. He is an intractable character unwilling to change his mind - a good Scotsman in my opinion - one of the few characters - who quickly and easily sums up Lucy's position. Which is what he does when Paulina asks Lucy what she does - Lucy replies: 'I am a teacher,'...Our narrator provides a careful lead in, culminating in the Count's reply:He did not know much about Lucy Snowe: what he knew, he did not very accurately comprehend: indeed his misconceptions of my character often made me smile; but he saw my walk in life lay rather on the shady side of the hill; he gave me credit for doing my endeavour to keep the course honestly straight; he would have helped me if he could: having no opportunity of helping he still wished me well. When he did look at me, his eye was kind; when he did speak, his voice was benevolent. 'Yours,' said he, 'is an arduous calling. I wish you strength and health to win in it - success.'  His fair little daughter did not take the information quite so composedly: she fixed on me a pair of eyes wide with wonder - almost with dismay. 'Are you a teacher?' cried she. Then having paused on the unpalatable idea,... 'And why do you go on with it?' Her father looked at, and I feared, was going to check her; but he only said, 'Proceed Polly ... Well Miss Snowe, why do you go on with it?' 'Chiefly, I fear, for the sake of the money I get.'Actually in this tiny section - there is the whole plot - Lucy's struggle to establish herself as a person equal to those around her - and when I use the word equal - Bronte and I share terms - we mean equal in character, intellect, ability, morality. But I would also like to point out - how simple is her style when - it comes to the crunch. There are plenty of examples of what I would call highfalutin language - but we'll skip those.Let's focus on the plot. Here is the point at which she must return to the Rue Fossette to Madam Beck's Pensionnat and her work as a teacher. Dr John/Graham has promised to write to her and to maintain his family's relationship with her.'And will Graham really write?' I questioned, as I sank tired on the edge of the bed. Reason, coming stealthily up to me through the twilight of that long, dim chamber, whispered sedately, - 'He may write once. So kind is his nature, it may stimulate him for once to make the effort. Lucy has allowed herself to hope that there will be a continued interest in herself and her circumstances from Dr John, and indeed his mother Mrs Bretton, who is in fact Lucy's Godmother, and her only semblance of family.The conversation between Lucy and Reason continues for several pages, she wants to write to Dr John, allow him to see the real her, but Reason answers:At your peril you cherish that idea, or suffer its influence to animate any writing of yours!' 'But if I feel, may I never express?' 'Never! declared Reason.At the end of this bitter argument - with herself, Lucy is found in the classe, huddled by the stove trying to imbibe some warmth into her frozen mind and body - and interesting it is M. Paul who finds her thus:'Mademoiselle, vous etes triste.' 'Monsieur, j'en ai bien le droit.' 'Vous etes malade de coeur et d'humeur,' he pursued. 'You are at once mourneful and mutinous. I see on your cheek two tears which I know are hot as two sparks, and salt as two crystals of the sea. While I speak you eye me strangely. Shall I tell you of what I am reminded while watching you?' 'Monsieur, I shall be called away to prayers shortly; my time for conversation is very scant and brief at this hour - excuse -' 'I excuse everything,' he interrrupted; 'my mood is so meek, neither rebuff nor, perhaps, insult could ruffle it. You remind me, then, of a young she wild creature, new caught, untamed, viewing with a mixture of fire and fear the first entrance of the breaker-in.'And he means 'breaker-in' to her heart not something else, automatically considered by modern readers.Our narrator often describes M. Paul as gnome like - but here the sense of his ability to discern exactly what she is feeling borders on the other-wordly - a true elf, gnome, magi - he is not privy to Lucy's past or recent excursion to La Terrasse the comfortable home of Graham and Mrs Bretton, and yet he reads Lucy absolutely.Which woman - out there has not yearned for a man -or mortal to address her so? To observe with the naked eye and yet see beyond what is on the surface? This is extraordinarily racy for present times - more so for 1853 - and yet M. Paul is no demon lover or celibate priest or any other incarnation he could be - but simply a man, aware of Lucy struggling to retain all her desires beneath a smooth facade. All the normal desires of a young woman, to have friendship, love, security, status, comforts - a pleasant life, with excitements as well as work and struggles.As M. Paul identifies after Lucy's performance in the school play \"vous etes une petite ambitiouse\". Yes - she is clever. She has desires and aims, but are these Needs any different from any woman young or old in any time period?Lucy's particular historical time setting means - she cannot advance in society through work or employment. In the early 19th century, her only way forward is to marry. This is the essential difference therefore, between then and now - her options are extremely narrow, but she battles on. Severely tried, she makes her way but will not use the wiles of certain ones - such as Ginevra Fanshaw. Nor does she have the fine breeding and background of Paulina - or her looks. Lucy's only advantages are what lie internally - her morals and intellect, her character - and it is on these that Charlotte Bronte builds her novel. Lucy chooses to believe, no matter how arduous the journey that - through her own strength and determination she will find a measure of happiness and success - and indeed she does..", "10/26/16 \"Forget the modern debate over 'likeable' female characters - Lucy is prickly, repressed, untrustworthy, unattractive, judgmental, in constant denial of her own feelings, desperate for affection, violently anti-Catholic - in short an IMPOSSIBLE female character.

She has no hope of power of pleasing, but this does not mean she has stopped wishing that she had it.\" -from Mallory Ortberg's introduction I had a difficult time reading Villette. The first few chapters and the protagonist, Lucy Snowe, never really captured and held my attention. I ended up finishing it by listening to the audiobook and reading along. But then the ending blindsided me, and the introduction, which I read afterwards, made me cry.I recall my great love for Jane Eyre happened after I reread it. And I feel my love for Villette can only grow. Lucy and Jane are very much alike, but Lucy is far more real than Jane. Lucy is solely concerned with survival and often succumbs to despair. She only rarely allows herself to daydream about the thing Jane craves: love. Lucy never asks for love; she has only known grief and does not want to go through another unnecessary bout caused by the loss of it. I very much see parts of myself in Lucy and feel very kindred to her, especially since my days far more closely resemble Lucy's than they will ever Jane's, with all their excitement and promises.Lucy's story doesn't reward you for listening to it, but there are rewards to be found in listening to Lucy Snowe.8/25/17 For the most part, this rereading experience was not very enjoyable. I think, on the whole, I will always find the first part of Villette a slog to overcome. There is a lot of the French language and many new, unlikable characters to meet and hear about, and many unsettling settings to discover. During the first part, too, we barely get a chance to understand Lucy, who she is, how she functions. She makes an effort to hide herself from the reader.During the rereading, I saw through a few things that Lucy intended to hide from the reader, and I looked on a couple male characters differently - oppositely - than I did when reading it for the first time. I enjoyed knowing I knew Lucy better than she perhaps wanted me to. Overall, however, Villette is not a happy book. Lucy is not a happy person and her life is not easy or full of pleasurable things. She's an outsider most of the time and is rarely, truly a part of someone else's life. This is a book about the pains of solitude, unrequited love and unfulfilled love. It is full of unwelcoming characters and places. It is a story that desperately tries to keep you at arm's length.But after all that, Lucy feels like a friend.One day this will get a true 5 stars from me - when I find enjoyment in the first part of the novel. Until then I will continue to reread Villette and never forget Lucy Snowe.7/14/19 this was a more enjoyable reading experience, though I\u2019ve dropped my rating to three stars. This novel continues to have too many unlikeable characters for me to love and a plot that feels pantsed more than planned. I always enjoy CB\u2019s writing, though this book has some of her most complicated language and extended metaphors that can be confusing. I enjoyed seeing the small details in the text and making connections I hadn\u2019t before.

Viewers are confronted with impressive fabrications\u2014TIE fighters, droids, a landspeeder, the Millennium Falcon, the Mos Eisley cantina, and the Death Star\u2014all to the end of camouflaging bad dialogue and weak acting. Certainly we give ourselves over to the film's charms, but Star Wars uses its setting to disguise its weaknesses.Less common are examples that use science fiction as a means to approach social issues from a perspective divorced from a reality that may be overladen with presuppositions and biases. These stories extrapolate worlds that may someday exist in order to speak to present concerns. Gattaca, A Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984 each use their setting for the purpose of something more than simply providing an engaging entertainment.Hisae Iwaoka's Saturn Apartments is somewhat enigmatic then in that it seems to fit neither of these categories. While the book does include a number of set pieces that provide fantastic viewscapes (notably, some gorgeous illustrations of the earth from outside the book's principal space structure), these have no narrative inadequacies to cover up. And while the book does present a world in which the strict class systems common to some dystopian fiction exert negative influence on its cast, making social statements seems to be the least of Iwaoka's concerns. (That may change as the story evolves, but as of the first two volumes, he doesn't seem overly interested in addressing social inequity.) Instead, the futurism and social state of Saturn Apartments seems in place wholly to the end of presenting a fully forged world in which Iwaoka's small story can take place.When I say small story that is only to say that this is not a book devoted to national or interspecies struggles. This is not a series about the end of the world (in a way, that already happened). This is not the story of good vs. evil, the rescue of a princess, or a race to recover a lost treasure before it's lost for all time. It's just the story of a boy who's just joined the workforce and is trying to come to grips with who he is in the shadow of his father's death five years early. And in that way, Saturn Apartments may actually be a bigger story than Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. After all, every person is an expansive universe of interests, motives, stories, treacheries, and dreams. And each of these universes is governed by an entirely unique set of forces, every bit as sovereign as gravity and entropy.In Saturn Apartments, the earth, for reasons as yet untreated had been abandoned for decades, existing now as a global nature preserve. Whether due war or pollution or a humanitarian attempt at a Babel-like house to scrape the heavens is, seemingly, apart from the interests of the series. All that matters is that the earth has been abandoned and all the remnant humanity dwells on a great ring encircling the earth in low orbit, pretty much smack in the middle of the stratosphere. While never explicitly referred to within the text as the Saturn Apartments, the ring does make the earth resemble Saturn a bit. Or at least maybe Uranus. The ring itself is divided into three strata, upper, middle, and lower sections. The middle section is devoted to public works such as schools, parks, government, and scientific endeavors. Elites live in the upper reaches of the ring while everyone else is shuffled into the lower division.Saturn Apartments primary narrative conceit (I mean, beyond the ring itself) is that somebody's got to was all those windows. Dwellings that sit on the epidermis of the ring have windows that look out into the reaches of space (everyone else has to content themselves with artificial light and skies) and, even in space, a film of dust gradually accumulates. Those with the money to do so, hire window washers to help them keep their perspicuity. As washers require space suits, months of training, and hours to pressurize in order to clean windows, it's rare that anyone from the lower levels have the opportunity to clean their windows; ironically, its these grime-caked windows of the lower levels that face the earth and the spectacular view that such portals could provide.Iwaoka's protagonist is Mitsu, the orphaned son of Aki, a washer who fell to earth in a window-washing accident five years ago. Mitsu has just graduated high school and is accepted into his father's guild, where he encounters all of Aki's old friends and co-workers. Mitsu is both diligent and distracted, the presence of a hard-working father he barely knew weighing heavily on his life and direction. He's a little bit lost, a little bit unformed, and pretty uncertain about his purpose in things. He's eager to find and prove his place within the guild but until he discovers himself for who he is, he'll never be able to confidently chart his own personal destiny. Saturn Apartments charts Mitsu's course through the interpersonal exchanges he experiences with co-workers and clients and then through the friendships he forms as a result. Mitsu's path evolves from one marked by loneliness toward something a bit more rounded with a breadth of human contact. Much of the fun of the series is watching him negotiate these new relationships while he takes cues from those around him in an attempt to understand how normal people interact. He's a great observer and does his best to conscientiously apply the practical knowledge his observations lend him. By having Mitsu looking in on a variety of lives from the outside literally looking in, Iwaoka leaves herself plenty of room to explore numerous story and relationship paths before wearing out her and Mitsu's welcome.One of the charms of Saturn Apartments is its unique visual sense. Iwaoka employs a style of illustration uncommon in, at the least, the manga I've yet encountered. Her character compositions sit far from what we may have come to expect from our Japanese comics, neither favouring the bold dynamism common in sh\u014dnen nor the ephemeral willowiness of sh\u014djo. Iwaoka instead essays what I imagine would have to be some sort of indie manga. Her line is confident in its hesitance, a practiced stutter. In many cases, independent creators have more imagination than they have talent; this is decidedly not the case with Iwaoka's work. She creates big-headed people and her men are often distinguishable from her women by fashion alone\u2014all, I suspect, by design. She also frequently employs visual gags to lighten the mood of what could otherwise be a book too sober by half.Saturn Apartments is an exciting book to take part in as its release gradually unfolds. Generally, I prefer to take in a series once its publication is complete (therefore eliminating the story-hindering two-to-ten-month wait between volumes), but Saturn Apartments is such a quiet pleasure for me that I'm happy to take it in whatever chunks are available to me.[Review provided courtesy of Good Ok Bad].", "Mitsu becomes a window washer.

And it is as a window-washer Mitsu begins to learn about the world, and about the complexity of relationships (neither friendship nor enmity are simple things, and even power comes with its frustrations and consequences.) Moveover, it is in this world, and with a view of the earth, Mitsu's father died, somewhat mysteriously, five years before the action of the novel begins. When Mitsu sees the view his father likely saw the day he disappeared, he is mesmerized by the earth's beauty, and longs to get to its surface some day (where he imagines his father to be.)This is not necessarily a mystery or an outer-space action-adventure novel. It's a carefully drawn exploration of Mitsu's social and emotional world, and of the futuristic social world as a whole, which is not so different -- a place with intense class stratifications and complex friendships. The consequences of poverty are not exactly as they are on earth (those on the bottom of the three tiers are on the low end of the socioeconomic spectrum and the only ones who have a view of the earth, but not if the windows are not regularly cleaned. And hiring people to clean windows take money. Those on the top tier, the wealthy, are the only ones who have enough natural light to keep them from getting sick.)Mitsu has friends and enemies and then there are the people who are clearly important but mysterious, too.

I don't know if the problem is with the translation, the way it's written or drawn or is it just me, but most of the stories collected here just went by without leaving any sort of impression. Most characters seemed a bit flat and their stories weren't that interesting.I did really like the general atmosphere of this soft sci-fi existential mundanity, though \u2014 the book feels like a companion piece to (much better) Planetes in its tone and the way it emphasises individual character perspectives, and the whole setting of this ring hovering above Earth is a very neat idea that just begs to be explored further and in more detail.

And I'm not going to lie, this is more babbling than a forward review. Also I'm writing this at 3 am. I am tired. So feel free to ignore this and read something more intelligent.I've read a lot of science fiction. A lot. Even have an entire bookshelf full of Gibson, Haldeman, Heinlein, etc. And yet I don't really consider myself a fan, and I'm always a little cautious about what science fiction books I'll pick up next. For the longest time I figured there has been something I have been resistant to about the genre, and I thought maybe I just secretly found the genre boring unless sword heaving robot kings or Terminators were involved.But I figured it out while reading Saturn Apartments. Iwaoka has this amazing ability to balance good characters and world building. Each chapter is fully character driven, and the art does a great job of showing us how this world surrounds the characters instead of just leaving it as a back drop for some random adventures. At the same time, the world building never takes precedence over character development.In fact I think there's plenty of comics out there that excel at this, especially manga. I feel like I could say the same about A,A', To Terra, I might argue Akira even fits the bill. But I'm not sure I could say the same about a lot of the prose sci-fi I've been devouring since I was a teenager.I really do think it's that balance I'm missing. There's just so many books focused on the world building or the high concept that it leaves the characters a bit flat. Of course, I can think of several books that do a beautiful job of balancing both (I'm partial to some of Le Guin's work myself). I'm just saying I think I know the sort of books I'll be hunting for in the future. .", "The Earth is a nature preserve. The population has been moved to a massive building that rings the world.

There aren't, as of yet, any brave rebels fighting against the social order. This is just the backdrop.The real story is about Mitsu, window washer. In orbit, washing windows outside is a dangerous task. Mitsu's father fell while washing windows, and now that he's graduated from school, he'll try to take his father's place in the window washers' guild. And so we have a series of quiet stories about life in orbit, with the science fiction setting serving as a backrop and a catalyst for recognizable, small human dramas. One of the stories is about a bride who saves so she can have her window washed on her wedding day. Yes, it's entirely slice-of-life in a distant future.The stories are engaging because of the characters, vivid and realistic even if they only show up on a few pages. Mitsu, our lead, is one of the most engaging. Lonely, hardworking, more sympathetic to the situations of others than to his own.The art won't be for everyone.

All humans live there, having abandoned the Earth to keep it as a nature preserve. Mitsu's father died doing the same job, and the story (so far) mostly revolves around Mitsu's attempts to learn more about his father by following his vocation.Saturn Apartments is kind of like Makoto Yukimura's Planetes in that it focuses on the lives of working class people in a science fiction setting. It's more about characters than human colonization of space, though, especially as Mitsu begins to interact more with his coworkers and their families, and upper-class clients of his window-washing company.The art is a little funny, with characters of all ages drawn with toddler proportions, i.e. big heads, small bodies. Older characters do look a little less toddler-y than junior high graduate Mitsu, so I adjusted pretty quickly. It's more than made up for by the amazing perspective work with rooms, both large and small, and the exterior of the station during work shifts. Several times I had to stop just to gawk at a specific panel.The personal growth, relationships, and vignettes about people on the station are so intriguing that I would have been happy reading this series just for that for more than its seven books. However, a larger plot started emerging later in the series where some working-class people on the station began a project to drop a manned craft down to Earth. Without spoiling, I can say that this project ends up intersecting with the class tensions on the station in an interesting and dramatic way that involves every character we got to know over the series.

For middle school. I absolutely love Jin, he acts so grumpy but he really cares about Mitsu and his wife.I wonder if this will explore all the inequality there is in the ring, what with window washing only being affordable for the rich, the groom in the one story not being able to get a good job because he was a low level-er and all the rest. I also wonder about Jin's friend's wife. Why did she not help Jin? Or would he have refused charity as he would have seen it?It's very interesting how their are drawbacks shown to all levels of the life they live as well. The three characters we meet from the upper levels are alone in huge rooms/apartments and seem a little lonely. They also mostly want things that did not work out for them, such as the biologist wanting to give his beluga whale an ocean show. It was Mitsu and Jin who did that, and the engineer who wanted to make a window washing robot, but found out no robot could do better than a human. Jin's friends wife also wanted to give her husband open sky and freedom, but could not. It was Jin who did. Contrasted with this is the lower level life. Sure, it is crowded and there is very little natural light, but look at any scene set there and no one is alone. The window washers are in their guild headquarters together. The Kagayamas are together with their daughter (or she sneaks into Mitsu's apartment) Jin has his wife, there is always someone there to watch out for you.Window washing is dangerous for many reasons, but the window washers are usually healthier because they get more natural light than mist low level residents.A story that gently teaches everything has two sides, good and bad, light and dark.I'm sad the library only has this one. .", "I really, really loved this.

I think what makes Saturn Apartments so memorable, is the use of the large science fiction setting to provide a world where Mitsu's story can take place.

The overall concept echoed one I read recently in the short story \"The Lollygang Save the World on Accident\" by Jay Lake in Extraordinary Engines: The Definitive Steampunk Anthology. Juxtaposing the wide-reaching worldbuilding with the specific central group of characters, I felt Lake failed to give either story the weight, reach, and time it needed. I believe I noted in my review there that he needed a whole book, not a short story, to explore that world, and--well, here someone's done that. Plenty of conceptual differences persist, but Iwaoka manages--perhaps through utilizing the comic medium?--to show both the huge, overall world and the specifics of the characters' lives. Everyone proves generally likable, if falling into specific tropes, and the world has a gritty, Blade-Runner-ish feel. With a twist of Japanese culture.I find myself also thinking of the webcomic Alice Grove (rough-concept-wise), the anime Sword Art Online (for the distinct layering of society--or perhaps that episode of Doctor Who? Gridlock?), and the Aqua, Volume 1/Aria, Volume 1 series for its admiration of the planet Earth (or perhaps Stellvia Volume 1? I've seen images of the Earth from above in manga before, is my point).

There's is multiple symbols in the book, and I found one of the symbols in the book is the most relatable to me. I believe the suits that the characters symbolizes how human always create new technology to make impossible possible. But at the same time, it symbolized that human is depending to much on the technology, and which humans won't be able to survive without them. The author uses the suit to tell people that technology can be a good thing, but it can also be a bad think if we over rely on them.4.

With nothing to do, Joan Scudamore ends up assessing her life and facing some unpalatable truths. Sounds less than thrilling, and yet... Christie writes in such a manner that even an unlikeable main character is rendered fascinating. The reader is enticed to gather all the clues of this life, especially the details in between the lines, to put together the picture of this woman and her influence, like an investigation. Not only this, there is a feeling of urgency growing through the pages - what will happen?Absent in the Spring was Christie\u2019s most satisfying work - \u201c...the book that I had always wanted to write, that had been clear in my mind. It was the picture of a woman with a complete image of herself, of what she was, but about which she was completely mistaken\u201d - and she does this masterfully, offering us a dramatic and intriguing psychological study. One can\u2019t help wondering if Agatha felt something similar when her fist husband left her, turning her life upside down. Everyone wonders where the author disappeared for those 11 days, but did she do just that - find herself an isolated spot and analyse her life, especially the signs pertaining to her husband that she had refused to see...

Amazingly, it is a pretty good story even though there is not a single murder in sight! The story follows Joan Scudamore, a middle-class wife and mother who is returning from a visit to her daughter in Iraq and is stuck in the middle of nowhere, in a desert, because of the railway lines being flooded. Oh, the irony. Anyway, Christie fabulously uses Joan's isolation to let her reflect on her life and ponder over her relationship with her husband and with her daughter. The crux of the story is that Joan's perception of herself and of the people around her are as much an illusion as the mirage she experiences when out walking in the desert.  The question, however, that keeps the story quite tense is whether Joan will realise this by the end of the book. I found myself reading this book with some apprehension as I had no idea what to expect. Of course, the biggest surprise was that I could hardly put the book down once the characters had been introduced and Joan's dilemma became clear. \"What was it Blanche had said?

As the past unravels, Joan feels the cracks in her life reveal themselves till she realises that from her family, from her friends, and indeed from the rest of the world, she has indeed been absent in the spring. This is a strange novel in that not a lot happens. It is almost entirely a character study of Joan. This is why the story is so compelling and so chilling. Perhaps Joan is in all of us. How many times do we promise ourselves that we will turn our lives around and then convince ourselves that everything is fine and that we can go on as before? When Rodney prays that Joan never learns how alone she truly is, it is a truly ironic and disturbing slap in the reader's face. The era may have changed but human nature has not.

Instead of a murder mystery, it\u2019s an elegant character study that reminded me most of The Enchanted April and The Rector\u2019s Daughter. Joan Scudamore, traveling back to London from Baghdad after a visit to her grown daughter, encounters bad weather and misses her train, which leaves her stranded in the desert for a few days that feel more like weeks. She remembers what Blanche Haggard, a school friend she unexpectedly ran into on her travels, said to her in reference to never having time to relax and do nothing but think. What might Joan discover about herself? Blanche teasingly wondered. Joan dismisses her promiscuous friend\u2019s words, offering up a pharisaical prayer: \u201cthank thee that I am not like that.\u201dJoan quickly runs out of books to read and tires of omelettes with tinned beans and fruit for three meals a day. She escapes from the rest house to take walks in the desert and the self-examination she\u2019s been putting off indefinitely proceeds. Christie makes full use of dramatic irony as we\u2019re led back through scenes from Joan\u2019s earlier life and realize that she\u2019s utterly clueless about what those closest to her want and think. Her husband Rodney wanted to be a farmer, but she pushed him to become a lawyer instead. Her older daughter was in love with a married man they drove her away from; their younger daughter married young just to get away from home.Rather like Olive Kitteridge, Joan is difficult in ways she doesn\u2019t fully acknowledge. Like a desert mirage, the truth of who she\u2019s been and what she\u2019s done is hazy, and her realization feels a little drawn out and obvious. But the question remains: once she gets back to London, will she act on what she\u2019s discovered about herself and reform her life, or just slip back into her old habits? I thought also of Anne of Tyler\u2019s Ladder of Years and its key word, inertia: it\u2019s so hard to change when you feel like you\u2019ve been doing well enough.

It was the picture of a woman with a complete image of herself, of what she was, but about which she was completely mistaken.\u201dI wonder if that is how she felt about her first marriage. If she thought they were completely happy and in love, had the perfect family\u2026 If she, years after her divorce, realized how nothing really was as she had assumed, how she had missed details, how she had \u201cknown\u201d things and had \u201cforgotten\u201d them.I don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed this book without having read her bio first. The main character is a pain. She has only one chapter of absolution, only one chapter when you root for her. But still, the book is wonderfully written. I was never bored..", "Oh. My. Word.

An 'About the Author' was included on my DVD so I clicked on it to learn a bit more about Agatha Christie. I learned that she also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott. I was gobsmacked; I had no idea. So of course I started down the rabbit hole of searching for the books written by Mary Westmacott, were they available at my library? (no), were they still in print, were they at my favorite bookstores, which should I read first? After looking at reviews on GR, 'Absent in the Spring' caught my eye. Now to search for an available copy.As an aside, I read a book once in which the bookshop owner would prescribe books to his patrons who came in looking for a book to read. I didn't like that book (dear heart that story meandered and lost its way) but I do like the premise of books being prescribed. Somehow, I felt that 'Absent in the Spring' had been assigned to me.So back to my search and my rabbit hole. I came across an audio version and the sample sounded just right. Sold! I'll buy it. Audible has it! BUT NOT IN MY COUNTRY - what is that all about? Chirp didn't have it so I looked for used CD's. I found used cassette tapes... I was going deeper and deeper into my rabbit hole and somehow I felt that I needed to listen to this book. It was assigned to me! I finally found an online version which was free but not ideal. I couldn't bookmark where I stopped listening and when I went to listen again the book started at the beginning and I had to scroll down through the chapters to figure out where I left off. But I persevered. And now I feel a bit exposed. Am I like Joan? Always so insistently helpful and well-meaning. Or am I like Leslie; a bit disheveled but thoughtful and observant about life and others. It seems we've all met Joans, and Leslies, and Rodneys, and the children in our life. But this story is about Joan (who is all alone).Why did (Mary Westmacott) Agatha Christie write this book? Was it about her? Was it about someone close to her? Was it cathartic to write? I think it is brilliantly written and quite an accomplishment. To write a novel which is mostly someone's inner thoughts and not have it be just rubbish is amazing. Joan had her Road to Damascus experience in the desert...Yet, she was a short-term convert. Or did she really change and apologize to Rodney but the book ends before that happens?I would highly recommend this book but it is not a book to be read lightly. As I said, I listened to it (Ann Beach did a superb job of reading it) and I now will continue down my rabbit hole to find a hard copy so I can underline in it. Perhaps I'll also find an audio version. This is a book to be re-read on occasion.SHAKESPEAREFrom you have I been absent in the spring,When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smellOf different flowers in odour and in hue,Could make me any summer\u2019s story tell,Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:Nor did I wonder at the lily\u2019s white,Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;They were but sweet, but figures of delightDrawn after you, \u2013 you pattern of all those.

We hear Joan\u2019s thoughts about her husband, her three children, her marriage, raising the children, and a little about people in their lives. While Joan states her views on these people and what a good wife and mother she is and marriage she has, it becomes rapidly clear that the people around her have very different and much more realistic impressions of the woman Joan actually is. Joan\u2019s insistence on her views, her lack of sensitivity, compassion and insight have caused a lot of harm to her relationships, to which she is completely unaware. That is, until she has too much time on her hands. And then it all comes down on her, her pretty pictures revealing themselves to be quite different. Christie\u2019s slowly revealed portrait of a utterly self-centred person is beautifully and devastatingly done. .", "This novel has made me introspective.

Of course, the rest house is managed decently well, and Joan doesn\u2019t have to worry about her safety or food. However, she has too much time on her hands. A woman used to being busy at all times finds herself doing nothing. Her meeting with Blanche, her childhood friend, before being stranded puts her in a contemplative mood. As Joan thinks back about her seemingly perfect life with a happy and successful husband and lovely kids, she realizes that the truth is different from her perception. Joan doesn\u2019t want to accept this new view of her life, but she can\u2019t help it. The more her unease grows, the more she realizes that her idea of perfect might have done more harm than good. Was Joan a competent and wise woman with a good head on her shoulders, or was she someone people endured for the sake of it? As a diehard fan of Christie, I extend the same love to the books she wrote as Mary Westmacott. These are more personal, introspective, and heavy with melancholy. Absent in the Spring is hard to categorize into a particular genre. Those who put it in romance couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Drama comes closest, I suppose. The first 30-40 pages are enough to give us an idea about the theme. We know the direction the story will take. We even know what it\u2019ll do to the lead character, Joan. But we still want to see if our assessment is right or not. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure how to review this one. It\u2019s bittersweet; frustrating at times because you cannot help but want to shake some sense into Joan. Annoying at times when Joan does nothing but delay her introspection. Yet, it is compelling because you can\u2019t help but continue reading to see if she\u2019ll notice and realize what you did. You can\u2019t wait for the ending because you hope for a positive beginning but know deep down that it may not happen. Oh, you\u2019ll come to hate Joan, pity her, and even hope for her. But can you love her? \u201cYou are alone and you will always be. But, please God, you\u2019ll never know it.\u201dTo sum up, Absent in the Spring is a must-read if you like analyzing characters and people. It is a must-read if you want to go introspect on your life and look at it from another perspective. The book has given me greater satisfaction than some of her mystery novels (and I\u2019m saying this as a fan of the author and a mystery lover). *****P.S: A reviewer mentioned Christie called this book her most satisfying work, and I can see why.*****PPS: I read the paperback and can say that it did make a difference to my reading experience. .", "Are you who you think you are?

I get why, besides being extremely prejudiced about others, Joan avoids everything real that might hurt her to a certain degree and is highly skilled at pretending her life is perfect; even though it's quite the contrary. She is extremely detestable because she is probably one of the most real characters you'll read about (at least in my experience). It's quite confronting to read this book actually. As others already stated: Everyone is a bit of a Joan Scudamore.A glimp of the story: Joan gets stuck in a resthouse in the middle of the desert with absolutely nothing to do, except to think. She revisits memories and slowly gets confronted with the real Joan Scudamore, who is not so perfect as she had thought herself to be.What I disliked?Not much. Though I feel a bit as if we could have learned more about Joans youth. Isn't someone's youth the time personality traits get shaped? But I have to admit it isn't a huge miss. The story is pretty perfect how it is, it's just something I'm curious about.(view spoiler)[I also felt the train chapter was a bit unnecessary. It didn't really add that much I think? Except Joan being able to express her feelings more clearly of course. Maybe I would have to let the story sink in a bit to understand everything though; or reread it sometime in the future. (hide spoiler)] What I liked?The way Christie describes the human mind is stunning. It's quite funny as well, her writing style from her detective novels is clearly visable. It's almost a bit like Joan is finding herself (the criminal) through pieces of evidence she is examening in her mind. Note that Christie's writing style is extremely light. Even though the story which is told is quite heavy, she described it in an extremely easy to read way.I felt dissapointed when reading the ending, but that's most likely the point of it. It was probably the best ending this story could get. I get why people would dislike it, but any other ending would have been unrealistic, really. (So yes, in a way I actually prefer the ending of the book over any other possible endings)ConclusionThis book is great if you're in the mood for some self discovery. It's a book with a very real story, but written in an enjoyable writing style.

That\u2019s what I kept thinking while reading this brilliant psychological novel. I spent the entire book immersed in the thoughts of Joan Scudamore and was given no other perspective, no other information. AND YET, while Joan was blind to what really happened, I was able to figure it out immediately. How could Joan tell me something that she herself didn\u2019t know? After rereading those passages I still don\u2019t know how Agatha pulled it off.

During her time there, she re-assess her life, her beliefs, attitude and relationships; how she views the world, how others view her, and how she views herself.Joan believed her life is perfect, in denial of the unpleasant, fearful of any true confrontations, avoiding it at every twist and turn, confrontations with her husband, children, friends, and more importantly herself.

Was it manipulative of her to use of her \"woman weapons\", the child in the crib and the child she bore to force her husband into a career he didn't want, a passion-less, tiresome lifestyle? Did her children truly love and respect her? Was she too strict and practical? Was her strictness as a parent, a display of a mother's love and affection or was it plain slavery, not to take her children's thoughts into account? Why did she feel superior to everyone else? Why did she actively pretend that she didn't?

It tells stories on the haunting of unsought dreams, and the curse of falling prey to our instant desires and impulses; balancing life with \"discipline\" but not too much \"discipline\".\"She hadn't. She hadn't known a thing! because quite determinedly, she hadn't wanted to know.\"Though the likability of Joan Scudamore is a matter of opinion, her relatability is not. There is a little bit of Joan Scudamore in all of humanity.

Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.\" The book reminded me of this quote from a movie called Harvey. For when Joan came to this shattering realisation, it was time to take action. However, knowing something, and doing it are very different. This is the part of the book, which explores the terrifying aspects of change. My favourite part was facing other people's expectations. Despite Joan's intentions, upon her meeting with her daughter, Averil, she was less inspired as she can physically and mentally see her daughter not expecting any change out of her, and henceforth, didn't share with her the new revelations she reached. I have to say, the ending line in the book is simply a slap in the reader's face.(view spoiler)[  'I'm not alone.

She is in the position of a person who has had the upper hand all her life and is now uncomfortable at the thought that she deliberately brushed aside negative reactions and anything that didn't suit her plans. This evaluation that Joan embarks on and what it reveals to her is such a brilliant examination of the human psyche in a way, especially those parts of ourselves that we keep hidden even from our own thoughts. As she sees a different perspective to everything, Joan is distraught with no one to confide in.I wondered how it would end and was happy to see that it was anything but cliched or conventional once again! Her spiralling thoughts and her attempts to comfort herself while reminiscing are just as absorbing as the intricate plots that Poirot reveals in the earlier books.

Not a problem, since I like well-written romance fiction, and the other instances I\u2019ve come across of writers who write both romance fiction and detective fiction (Georgette Heyer and MC Beaton/Marion Chesney come to mind) have been mostly rewarding. And Christie, anyway, is usually very readable. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d end up hating the book, at any rate.I plunged into Absent in the Spring without knowing anything about it. It turned out to not be a romance, after all, but it was a story which really gripped me and made me think.Joan Scudamore is the protagonist of this novel, a woman in her late forties, heading back to England from Baghdad, after having nursed her married daughter Barbara back from an illness. Along the way, Joan runs into an old schoolmate, Blanche, who has lived the sort of scandalous life Joan looks down upon\u2014and who, to Joan\u2019s horror, doesn\u2019t seem to be at all embarrassed about it, or repentant. Joan travels on, and soon finds herself stranded in the middle of the desert, waiting at a Rest House near a railway line for a train which may come nobody knows when\u2014rains have caused breakdowns all along the way.While she waits, for several days, Joan exhausts her meagre supply of books and then, for want of anything better to do, begins to go for long walks, during which she reminisces about her past. Her marriage, her children, her husband, their friends. Herself. And she comes, slowly and finally, to the painful realization that she, the very good Joan Scudamore, may not be quite as wonderful as she\u2019s imagined herself to be all these years.It wasn\u2019t difficult to draw parallels between this novel and most of Christie\u2019s detective novels: she makes no attempt to change her writing style, so is easily recognizable. Also, some elements that are so common in Christie\u2019s detective fiction find their way in here: the secrets that families harbour, the rancor and bitterness that lurks beneath the surface of even, seemingly, the most solid of relationships. The human nature that Miss Marple was so good at using as a reference to solve pretty much every case that came her way. But Absent in the Spring is, all said and done, very different from any of the detective novels. So refreshingly different, and so good. It unsettled me, and made me rethink my own life (especially since I am pretty close to the same age as Joan Scudamore!), and made me wonder if I was as self-righteous and as blind to my faults, as smug as this woman. Very readable, very hard-hitting in its way, and overall a memorable book. And yes, the ending was perfect. .", "I had apprehensions about reading my favourite author outside her genre and I'm disappointed.

She did and gave what she could and lived how she knew best, being kinder to her children and husband than they were to her ; certainly loving them and being loyal. No one should be expected to be a telepath ceaselessly living to please and serve. After all, however shallow her life seems it was not wicked. She did not live a lie like the rest of her family chose to live - enablers, concealing their feelings and thoughts, weak and afraid to talk to each other, glad to have someone to blame and despise. I can see Joan, with all her flaws, in a better family that appreciates her..", "It\u2019s slow and very, very different from Agatha Christie mysteries. But the way it leaves you feeling !

You had to know this would be part of the deal for this review. So, now that I have gotten it out of my system, (it is out, right?) we can proceed.When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist.It was a word that Barbara Bush might have had in mind when she described Geraldine Ferraro, her husband\u2019s opponent for the Vice Presidency, in 1984. \u201c\"I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich,'\" she said, later insisting that the word in question did not begin with a \u201cb,\u201d but a \u201cw.\u201d Sure, whatever. But in this case, I suppose both might apply. Circe is indeed the first witch in western literature. And many a sailing crew might have had unkind things to say about her. Madeline Miller - image from The TimesOur primary introduction to Circe (which we pronounce as Sir-Sea, and even Miller goes along with this, so people don\u2019t throw things at her. But for how it might be pronounced in Greek, you know, the proper way, you might check out this link. Put that down, there will be no throwing of things in this review!) was that wondrous classic of Western literature, The Odyssey. Given how many times this and its companion volume, The Iliad, have been reworked through the ages, it is no surprise that there have been many variations on the stories they told. Circe\u2019s story has seen its share of re-imaginings as well. But Miller tries to stick fairly close to the Homeric version. Be warned, though, some license was taken, and other sources inspired the work as well. But it is from Homer that we get the primary association we have with her name, the magical transmutation of men into pigs.George Romney's 1782 portrait of Emma Hamilton as Circe - image from wikipediaWe follow the life of our Ur-witch from birth to whatever. She did not start out with much by way of godly powers. Her mother, Perse, daughter of the sea-god Oceanos, was a nymph, and her father was Helios, the sun god. Despite the lofty position of Pop\u2019s place in things, Circe was just a nymph, on the low end of the godly powers scale. This did not help in the family to which she had been born. Not one of her parents\u2019 favorites, she was blessed with neither power nor beauty, had a very ungod-like human-level voice, and her sibs were not exactly the nicest. Kinda tough to keep up when daddy is the actual bloody sun. Years pass, and one day she comes across a mortal fisherman. He seems pretty nice, someone she can talk to. She\u2019d like to take it to the next stage, so she lays low, listens in on family gatherings, and picks up intel on substances that might be used to effect powerful and advantageous changes. She asks her grandmother, Tethys, (very Lannisterish wife AND SISTER to Oceanos) to transform him into a god for her, but Granny throws her out, alarmed when her granddaughter mentions this pharmakos stuff she had been looking into. Left to her own devices she tries this out on her bf, making him into his truest self. It does not end the way she\u2019d hoped. (Pearls before you-know-what.) Not the last bad experience she would have with a man. Levy\u2019s 1889 Circe - image from wikipediaHer relationships with men are actually not all bad. Daddy is singularly unfeeling, and can be pretty dim for such a bright bulb, and her brothers are far less than wonderful, but there is some good in her sibling connections as well. She has a warm interaction with a titan, Prometheus, which is a net positive. Later, she has an interesting relationship with Hermes, who is not to be trusted, but who offers some helpful guidance. And then there are the mortals, Daedalus (the master artist, the Michelangelo, the Leonardo da Vinci of his era), Jason, of Argonaut fame, Odysseus, who you may have heard of, and more. There were dark encounters as well, and thus the whole turning-men-into-pigs thing. Brewer's 1892 Circe and Her Swine - image from WikipediaMiller has had a passion for the classics since she was eight, when her mother read her the Iliad and began taking her to Egyptian and Greek exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It made her a nerdy classmate but was a boon when she got to college and was able to find peers who shared her love of the ancient tales. It was this passion that led her to write her first novel, The Song of Achilles, a reimagining of Achilles relationship with his lover, Patroclus, a delight of a book, a Times bestseller, and winner of the Orange prize. It took her ten years to write her first novel, about seven for this one and the gestation period for number three remains to be seen. She is weighing whether to base it on Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest or Virgil\u2019s Aeneid. If past is portent, it will be the latter, and should be ready by about 2025.Ulysses and Circe, Angelica Kauffmann, 1786. - image from Miller\u2019s siteThe central, driving force in the story is Circe becoming her fullest possible self. (I suppose one might say she made a silk purse from a sow\u2019s ear. I wouldn\u2019t, but some might.) This is the story of a woman finding her power and, as part of that, finding her voice. She starts out really unable to say what she thinks and by the end of the book, she\u2019s able to live life on her terms and say what she thinks and what she feels. - from the Bookriot interviewMost gods are awful sorts, vain, selfish, greedy, careless of the harm they do to others. Circe actually has better inclinations. For instance, when Prometheus is being tortured by the titans for the crime of giving fire to humans, Circe alone is kind to him, bringing him nectar, and talking with him when no one else offers him anything but anger and scorn. She is curious about mortals, and asks him about them, going so far as to cut herself to experience a bit of humanity. Carracci's c.\u20091590 Ulysses and Circe in the Farnese Palace - image from WikipediaLivestock comes in for some attention outside the sty. Turns out Circe\u2019s father has a thing for a well-turned fetlock, so maybe she comes by her affinity for animals of all sorts, albeit in a very different way, quite naturally. Her island is rich with diverse fauna, including some close companions most of us would flee. An early version of Doctor Doolittle? Scholars have debated whether Circe\u2019s pet lions are supposed to be transformed men, or merely tamed beasts. In my novel, I chose to make them actual animals, because I wanted to honor Circe\u2019s connection to Eastern and Anatolian goddesses like Cybele. Such goddesses also had power over fierce animals, and are known by the title Potnia Theron, Mistress of the Beasts. Not be confused with  The BeastmasterCirce and Odysseus. Allessandro Allori, 1560 - image from Miller\u2019s siteWhile she has her darker side (she does change her nymph love-rival Scylla into a beast of epic proportions, which gets her sent to her room, or in this case, island, and there is that pig thing again) she is also a welcoming hostess on her isle of exile, Aiaia. (Which sounds to me like the palindromic beginning of a lament, Aiaiaiaiaiaiaia, which might feel a bit more familiar with a minor transformation, to oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy). I mean, she runs a pretty nifty BnB, with free-roaming wild animals, of both the barnyard and terrifying sort, a steady flow of wayward nymphs sent there by desperate parents in hopes that Circe might transform them into less troublesome progeny, a table with a seemingly bottomless supply of food and drink. And she is more than willing to offer special services to world-class mortals, among others. I mean, after that little misunderstanding with Odysseus about his men, (Pigs? What pigs? What could you possibly mean? Oh, you mean those pigs. Oopsy. How careless of me.) she not only invites everyone to stay for a prolonged vacay, but shacks up with the peripatetic one, offers him instructions on reaching the underworld, suggests ways to get past Scylla and Charybdis, and probably packs bag lunches for him and his crew. She is not all bad. Barker's 1889 Circe - image from WikipediaCirce struggles with the mortals-vs-immortals tension. Her mortal voice makes her less frightening to the short-lived ones, allowing her to establish actual relationships with them that a more boombox-voice-level deity might not be able to manage. Of course, it is still quite limiting that even the youngest of her mortal love interests would wither and die while she remained the same age pretty much forever. Knowing that you will see any man you love die is a definite limiting factor. Yet, she manages. She certainly recognizes what a psycho crew the immortals are, even her immediate family, and respects that mortals who gain fame do so by the sweat of their brow or extreme cunning, (even if it is to dark purpose) not their questionable godly DNA. Reinforcing this is her front row seat to the real-housewives tension between the erstwhile global rulers, the Titans, and the relatively new champions of everything there is, the Olympians. I mean, perpetual torture, thunderbolts, ongoing seditious plots, the nurturing of monsters, wholesale slaughter of mortals? She knows a thing or two, because she\u2019s seen a thing or two. My thoughts about [Circe as caregiver] really start with the gods, who in Greek myth are horrendous creatures. Selfish, totally invested only in their own desires, and unable to really care for anyone but themselves. Circe has this impulse from the beginning to care for other people. She has this initial encounter with Prometheus where she comes across another god who seems to understand that and also who triggers that impulse in her. I wanted to write about what it\u2019s like when you to want to try to be a good person, but you have absolutely no models for that. How do you construct a moral view coming from a completely immoral family? - from Bookriot interviewCirce Offering the Cup to Odysseus \u2013 by John William Waterhouse \u2013 1891 - image from WikimediaOf course, there is a pretty straight line between the sort of MCP hogwash Circe had to endure in the wayback and recent events that have been getting so much attention of late \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to write Circe\u2019s story in a modern way\u2026 I was just trying to be true to her experience in the ancient world.\u201d\u201cIt was a very eerie experience. I would put the book away and check the news. The top story was literally the same issue I had just been writing about \u2014 sexual assault, abuse, men refusing to allow women to have any power ... I was drawn to the mystery of her character \u2014 why is she turning men into pigs?\u201d \u2013 from The Times interviewThere are plenty of classical connections peppered throughout Circe\u2019s tale. Jason and Medea (niece) pop by for a spell. She is summoned to assist in the birthing of the minotaur (nephew) to her seriously nasty sister. She is part of Scylla\u2019s origin story, interacts with Prometheus (cousin), gives shit to Athena, even heads into the briny deep to take a meeting with a huge sea creature (no, not the Kraaken). Hangs with Penelope (her bf\u2019s wife) and Telemachus (bf\u2019s son), and spends a lot of time with Hermes. She definitely had a life, many even, particularly for someone who was ostracized to live on an island.For Circe, I would say the Odyssey was my primary touch-stone in the sense that that\u2019s where I started building the character. I take character clues directly from Homer\u2019s text, both large and small. I mentioned her mortal-like voice. The lions. The pigs. And then when I get to the Odysseus episode in the book, I follow Homer obviously very closely\u2026 - from the BookRiot interview\"Circea\", #38 in Boccaccio's c.\u20091365 De Claris Mulieribus, a catalogue of famous women, from a 1474 edition - image from wikipedia In terms of sources, I used texts from all over the ancient world and a few from the more modern world as well. For Circe herself, I drew inspiration from Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses and Apollonius of Rhodes\u2019 Argonautica, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid,\u00a0the lost epic Telegony (which survives only in summary)\u00a0and myths of the Anatolian goddess Cybele. For other characters, I was inspired by\u00a0the Iliad, of course, the tragedies (specifically the Oresteia, Medea and Philoctetes), Vergil\u2019s Aeneid again, Tennyson\u2019s Ulysses\u00a0and Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida. Alert readers may note a few small pieces of Shakespeare\u2019s Ulysses in my Odysseus! - from Refinery29 interviewCirce \u2013 by Lorenzo Garbieri - image From Maicar Greek Mythology LinkMadeline Miller\u2019s Circe is not a lovelorn, lonely heart desperate for connection in her isolation, but a multi-faceted character (not actually a human being, though), with inner seams of the dark and light sort, with family issues that might seem familiar in feel, if not in external content, with sins on her soul, but a desire to do good, and with a curiosity about the world. She may not have been the brightest light in the house of Helios, but she glowed with an inner strength, a capacity for mercy, an appreciation for genius, beauty and talent, and a fondness for pork. This is the epic story of a life lived to the fullest. Circe is an explorer, a lover, a destroyer, and can be a very angry goddess. This transformative figure is our doorway to a very accessible look at the Greek tales which lie at the root of so much of our culture. If you have a decent grounding in western mythology this will offer a delightful refresher. If you do not, it can offer a delightful introduction, and will no doubt spark a desire to root about for more. Madeline Miller may not have a wand with special powers, or transmogrifying potions at her command, but she demonstrates here a power to transform mere readers into fans. Circe is a fabulous read!

I was very privileged to go a very good high school where I was able to study The Iliad and The Odyssey for a class my freshman year. And fourteen-year-old Melanie fell in love. To say I was obsessed was an understatement, and more and more my heart was filled with love for Odysseus, Athena, and a certain love affair with the witch-goddess Circe. (Beautiful art by Kevin Nichols) Even upon finishing that class, I still couldn\u2019t get enough of Homer\u2019s words. And to this day, The Iliad and The Odyssey are the only books that I collect many editions of. All my loved ones and family correlate these epic poems with me, and always bring me new editions from their travels, and give me gifts for special events and holidays the same way they do with Harry Potter. One of the most prized possession I own is an edition of The Odyssey that was given to me by someone who meant a lot to me, at a very important time in my life. And these two tomes will always be a big part of my identity, and I will always recognize that they not only shaped me as a reader, but they shaped me as a human being, too. So, when I found out that that Greek mythology retelling queen, Madeline Miller, was writing a book centered around Circe, I knew it was going to end up being one of my favorite books of all time. And it ended up being everything I wanted and more. I hate to throw around the word masterpiece, but if I had to pick a book to give that title to, I\u2019d pick Circe. \u201cOdysseus, son of Laertes, the great traveler, prince of wiles and tricks and a thousand ways. He showed me his scars, and in return he let me pretend that I had none.\u201dAnd even though Odysseus plays a huge role in this story, this book is Circe\u2019s and Circe\u2019s alone. We get to see her growing up in Oceanus, with her Titan sun god father Helios, and loveless nymph mother Perse, and her three more ambitious siblings, Ae\u00ebtes, Pasipha\u00eb, and Perses. We get to see her living her life of solitude, exiled on the island of Aiaia. We also get to see her make a few very important trips, that are very monumental in Greek mythos. But we get to see all of Circe, the broken parts, the healing parts, and the complete parts. We get to see her love, her loss, her discovery, her resolve, and her determination. We get to see her question what it means to be immortal, what it means to be a nymph in a world ruled by gods, and what it means to just live. Her journey is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read before, and probably unlike anything I will ever read again. I have no combination of words to express how much her life and her story means to me. But I promise, I\u2019m not the same person I was before reading this book.\u201c\u2026All my life had been murk and depths, but I was not a part of that dark water. I was a creature within it.\u201dThis is ultimately a story about how different the tales will always be told for a man. And how the ballads will always be sung for heroes, not heroines, even if a woman was truly behind all the success the man greedily reaped. How the light will always fall to vilify the woman and showcase her as a witch that needs to be tamed, a sorceress that needs to be subdued, or an enchantress that needs to be defeated. Women, no matter how much agency they carve out in any male dominated world, will always be a means to an end to further the achievements of man. Always. And Circe displays that at the forefront of this story. Circe is most well known for turning Odysseus\u2019s men into pigs when they come to her island in The Odyssey, but Madeline Miller does such a wonderful job weaving all this Greek mythology into a fully fleshed out, brand-new tale. She has created something so unique, yet so breathtakingly good, I think so many readers will find it impossible to put this new-spin of a story down. I was completely captivated and enthralled from the very first line to the very last line. This book just feels so authentic, I felt like I was in the ocean, on the island, and traveling right beside Circe throughout. And I never wanted to leave her side. \u201cIt was their favorite bitter joke: those who fight against prophecy only draw it more tightly around their throats.\u201dOverall, I understand that this is a book that is very targeted to me and my likes. Not only is this a character driven story, with a main protagonist being a character I\u2019ve been in love with for over a decade, but the writing was lyrical perfection. I\u2019m such a quote reader, and I swear I would have highlighted this entire book. This book is also so beautifully feminist that it makes me weep just thinking about the things Circe had to endure. And it showcases the unconditional love of found families, yet also between a mother and her child, while simultaneously abolishing the notion that blood is worth more than anything else in any world. This book heavily emphasizes that you will never be the mistakes that your parents have committed. The entire story is a love letter to love itself and reveals all the things we are willing to do in the name of it. And most importantly, this is a book about how we are truly only ever in charge of our own stories, even though our actions may change the fate for others around us. Please, pick this masterpiece up, and I hope it changes your life, too. Thank you, Madeline Miller, I will carry your Circe in my heart for the rest of my life. \u201cThat is one thing gods and mortals share: when we are young, we think ourselves the first to have each feeling in the world.\u201dTrigger/Content Warnings: Violence, gore, murder, torture, physical abuse, child abuse, thoughts of suicide, brief scene with cutting, graphic childbirth scenes, mention of bestiality, mention of incest, animal sacrifice, death of a sibling, death of a child, death of a loved one, death of an animal, rape, adultery, and war themes.

Why do you guys like this book so much? I am going to go through one potentially good thing by one ultimately disappointing thing and see if any of them click.1) Because it\u2019s a cool retelling?This is why I was excited for this, as someone who loves retellings. Recycled plots? Old-timey magic and Revenge and mean dads and royalty and dashed love stories that make women turn witchy? Sign me the hell up! But this wasn\u2019t really a retelling. It felt like if I were like \u201cI\u2019m going to rewrite American history, but from the perspective of some random chick who happened to be there for/sexually involved in a bunch of it.\u201d It didn\u2019t feel like one cohesive story at all. It felt like me writing a series of vignettes about a woman who had a crush on multiple founding fathers.2) Did you all like Percy Jackson?Is this Percy Jackson for the now-kind-of-grown-ups who once read Percy Jackson? Were you all the weird 11-year-olds who thought they were Greek mythology professors because they read about Logan Lerman\u2019s quirky sea-based summer camp misadventures? (Sorry I mentioned the movie. I know you guys hate that.) I read those books in elementary school, too, but even then I was extremely cool and quirky and unique and had tons of unpopular opinions and wasn\u2019t a big fan. So maybe it\u2019s that?3) Let\u2019s talk about Greek mythology except with one woman instead of a bunch of men?This is another reason I was excited about this, because I cannot think of a single instance in which a single witchy woman is not a million jillion times better than 100 interchangeable White Men Of History Or Fake Magic History. Well, now I can think of a single instance. If that woman spends the whole book basically on one island, even if that island is near monsters, even if that woman gets the occasional visit from a minor god or two, that is so much more boring. Because even with some significant editorializing, that woman is still witnessing maybe 7% of what\u2019s going down. And it\u2019s not really the fun 7%.4) Let\u2019s talk about Greek mythology except make it feminist and take out the girl hate?Another thing that I was excited about and then all of the excitement was brutally eked out of my soul over the course of like 400 hours of listening or however long this book was. Circe f*cks a married man or two in this book, and uh. Last time I checked...not the most feminist? Also, she\u2019s not exactly awesome to the spouses of these dudes. Double also, I feel like Penelope (Odysseus\u2019 wife) was a pretty blank slate and could\u2019ve been made into a real badass. Instead she, like so much of this book, was boring as hell.5) Because there\u2019s a badass female protagonist?This was like the single biggest selling point to me, and therefore THE MOST WRENCHING DISAPPOINTMENT. I truly feel -- and maybe I\u2019m the only one who feels this way -- like this was not so much a badass female protagonist as a woman who spends an (immortal, neverending) lifetime with a series of men. I did not want a series of romances. I wanted a badass, vengeful woman with witchy magical powers. Bottom line:What I wanted: Feminism! Mythology! Retelling! Badass cool protagonist!What I got: Boring. Island. More island. ----------currently-reading updatesme: ok time to write an essay!this traitor book: or - and here me out on this one - you could not do that and read insteadme: hm...compelling.", "4.45/5 \u2b50Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf \ud83d\udc3a\u201dWitches are not so delicate\u201d.Witches are raw power.

And raw power through its definition is not delicate.Being honest right now, I have never been a huge fan of Greek mythology. I used to be obsessed with Egyptian mythology and fascinated by the Celtic one. But Greek mythology seemed all Greek to me (pun intended!). Not because it was unattractive, but just because I never understood it properly. I felt like it was a never-ending tale, too elaborate for my capacity of understanding. But this book written by Madeline Miller, Circe, helped the eyes of my mind flush open with understanding and for this I am thankful. Circe is introduced to us as a nobody. She is neither a full Goddess, in the true meaning of the concept, nor a mudblooded mortal. She is a Goddess, the daughter of the mighty Sun, the Titan Helios, and the beautiful nymph Perse, but the mundanity of her voice and the inutility of her presence made her a lesser Goddess in other Gods' point of view, even lesser than universally considered. She is an outcast even in her own family and as hard as she wants to change this, she\u2019s bound by unseen powers not to (Fates, duh!).The book expands some universal and social ideas: the road of an outcast hero, searching for love in a loveless life, feminist actions abnormal for the collective mentality of the time, vengeance and forgiveness. So many more.Starting with the road of an outcast hero, all is there to say is if you are not outcasted, then you don\u2019t suffer and if you don\u2019t suffer you have no drive to make something worth out of your life. In this case, an infinite, immortal life. Circe\u2019s exile on the isle of Aiaia makes her realise the infinite power that she possesses within her and everywhere around her. It all starts with a plant. It all ends with the same plant.Pharmaka is associated in the book with witchcraft. The power of the herbs to heal is magical. In my native language, Romanian, there is a word similar to the word pharmaka and its meaning from the book. We say farmece, witchery spells. When someone does farmece to you, that person casts an unseen and unfelt spell over you (both metaphorically and practically speaking). Circe\u2019s power is to tame the so-feared pharmaka and use it without being afraid. Circe is a powerful individual, but she gains this power from her wisdom, the wisdom of time: \u201d\u201dYou are wise\u201d, he said. \u201dIf it is so\u201d, I said, \u201dit is only because I have been a fool enough for a hundred lifetimes\u201d\u201d. She is a free spirit and she has her father\u2019s roots of pride. She is her own master and she doesn't agree with the ancient etiquettes, sung by bards and stuck for eternity in people\u2019s minds: \u201eHumbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets. As if there can be no story unless we crawl and weep\u201d. This shows the power of freedom she raised in herself.Circe is powerful, yes. Circe is unique. Circe is herself. She gives us a valuable lesson on how to live free and how to live sufficiently. She is a figure of self-respect and self-care and she says, with unspoken words, that if you want to live happily, you have to live true to yourself. And as to paraphrase a quote from the book as my own strong impression of Circe, however gold she shines, do not forget her fire.(Book-inspired).", "You threw me to the crows, but it turns out I prefer them to you.My words are not as good as the ones in this book.

She has such a way with words that it is absolutely impossible not to be engaged in her storytelling. The thing that brings this whole novel together is Circe\u2019s character. She is a woman who has done awful, evil things, and yet remains unfailingly human. She is lonely, and harsh, and hiding herself in sarcasm much of the time. And there is not a moment in this novel in which I didn\u2019t adore her. Madeline Miller does such an amazing job developing this character, weaving her thoughts into the narrative without manipulating you into feeling a certain way, keeping the narrative wide yet keeping it focused around Circe. Throughout this novel I developed such a deep level of admiration for both this author and this character, this character I\u2019m sure will stay with me forever.This novel is so interesting because at its core, it is an exploration of the voice of women in Greek mythology. Circe is a character we see nothing of in the narrative of Greek mythology, a character with seemingly evil intentions and little motivation \u2013 and all this despite showing up in several different stories. There\u2019s something supremely excellent about seeing a character like this who is essentially a plot device be given a story. I know I have a tendency to repeat the term \u201cnarrative agency\u201d but it beats repeating\u2014I absolutely love giving characters who have been given no agency the agency they deserve.I mean, everything about this book was just brilliant. I loved the myth interpretation: Penelope and Odysseus are both written perfectly, and seeing Jason basically get called an asshole while Medea stood on being young and morally grey and in love was so fantastic. And the exploration of gods vs. mortals is just brilliant: You cannot know how frightened gods are of pain. There is nothing more foreign to them, and so nothing they ache more deeply to see.I loved the relationships \u2014 just as a special note, the relationship between Circe and Telegonus made me want to cry. I basically loved everything. I mean, I think you guys have gotten pretty easily why I liked this so much \u2014 a morally-grey-character-driven retelling revolving around agency is basically my entire what-I-like bio. This did all the things I like and I want to reread it daily and hourly. I very well might.

I'm not sure if that's because my tastes were different back then, or if it was just because the plot had more of a romantic focus than Circe. But, w\u201cWitches are not so delicate,\u201d I said.I absolutely loved this. If you enjoy Greek mythology, complex heroines, and a generous serving of adventure, bloodshed, betrayal, magic, and monsters - both literal and figurative - then hell, READ THIS BOOK.To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of Miller's The Song of Achilles when I read it a few years back. I'm not sure if that's because my tastes were different back then, or if it was just because the plot had more of a romantic focus than Circe. But, whatever the reason, I had no such problem with this book. I was absolutely captivated from start to finish.Circe is part beautifully-written literary fantasy and part divine Greek soap opera. This strange combination makes for a book that is extremely quotable, rich in description and detail, and also a pageturner. It moves seamlessly between the broader scope of the world and its many gods and monsters, to the more narrow focus of the nymph-turned-witch, Circe, and her daily life before and after she is exiled to the island Aeaea.Circe becomes a powerful witch, but the strength of her story is in all her relatable flaws and weaknesses. We follow her as a naive lesser nymph, longing to be accepted and loved. We stay with her as she believes the lies of others and, later, becomes hardened against such deceivers. Her compassion constantly battles with her rage. Understandably.There is some grim satisfaction to be gained as this woman who has been bullied, belittled and trod on her entire life slowly claws out some vengeance for herself. The pain she endures along the way means that her successes are bittersweet. In the end, Circe might be full of fantasy, backstabbing and murder, but it is first and foremost the story of one woman's life - through pain, love, desire, heartache and motherhood.I did not go easy to motherhood. I faced it as soldiers face their enemies, girded and braced, sword up against the coming blows. Yet all my preparations were not enough.Other Greek myths play out in the background - that of the Minotaur, and of Icarus, as well as many others - but it is Circe's personal tale that hits the hardest. I just hope we don't have to wait another seven years for Miller to write another novel like this.TW: Rape; graphic violence.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube.", "This is a beautiful book; it is flawless and intelligent.

I loved it!Circe chronicles the life of a lesser god. She is the daughter of the mighty God Helios, the living embodiment of the sun. She is born without any particular talents or powers. She exists in the shadows of her more developed brothers and sisters. She does not shine in such spectacular company. However, gifts come in many different forms and those with hidden talents are overlooked and devalued. More often than not quiet people are forgotten about and there worth ill-considered in all walks of existence. Circe\u2019s family never saw what she could become. Power is important, though sometimes having none teaches one a greater lesson: nothing is worth having unless it has been earned. As such Circe wills herself into power as she discovers her affinity for witchcraft, especially the art of transformation.Her family banish her from their company for her use of such a lowly art, and in doing so they set her free. She finds herself in her exile. On her island home she finds a paradise not a prison. She becomes one with nature and finds company with lions and wolves. Centuries pass, ages pass, and eventually some rather important characters come her way. She meets Hermes and Athena, Icarus and his farther Daedalus, and Odysseus, a man who changes her life and causes her to make a very powerful decision that leads this book into such an excellent conclusion.\u201cBut in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.\u201d Circe offers a huge story, a story that spans generations and includes many Greek heroes and gods. Such is the nature of godhood, of immortality. When life goes on forever many notable people cross one\u2019s path. And despite the huge number of famous characters here, none of it felt forced: it all slotted perfectly into Circe\u2019s life. There are so many myths that intertwine with Circe, like the story of the Minotaur and the fall of Icarus, though despite the famous nature of many of them they don\u2019t for a second overshadow her. She met Prometheus when she was young and decided that her life would not be the same as the other gods: she was going to be her own woman. And this is a book about her finding the most ultimate form of freedom. I could not recommend it more highly. I really liked The Song of Achilles though this surpassed it in every way. I really hope to see more from this author in the future.

But, I digress.If Miller's ultimate goal is to introduce Greek mythology to a new generation of readers, then, I think she succeeded. However, that's ALL she achieved.This story about an inferior but immortal nymph called, Circe, who is a progeny of not one but TWO Titans -Helios and Oceanus- is decidedly underwhelming, trite, and overwrought with both too many characters yet very little story progression. Presumedly, the author had a checklist of events (and characters) that simply had to make an appearance in the story, even if the tangent was superfluous and unrelated:Prometheus, and the banishment. CheckScylla, the six-headed monster. CheckPasiphae, Daedalus, the Bull of Poseidon, and the horror that was Minotaur. CheckLet's not forget, Odyssey.And HermesAnd AthenaAnd many others who (please listen closely) WERE NOT REQUIRED TO MOVE THIS STORY FORWARD. Think I'm making this up? Well, let's see what the story's about shall we?1. Circe is so dull and uninteresting that2. Pretty much everyone ignores her; that is, until... 3. She uses her magic to turn Scylla into the six-headed monster. 4. Consequently, she's exiled to an island5. Where she at times turned unsavoury sailors into pigs6. Eventually leaving the island only after having lived there for centuries.7. The end.All in all, I think if you're new to mythology then this is for you; but even then I'd recommend reading Greek Mythology: A Captivating Guide to the Ancient Gods, Goddesses, Heroes, and Monsters instead..", "\"Next time you're going to defy the gods, do it for a better reason.\"Circe has always known that she does not belong.

They, in turn, have never ceased to remind her that she is the lesser daughter of greater sires. So when she displays an affinity for witchcraft and is exiled to a remote island, she jumps at the chance. Here finally is the opportunity to live life on her own terms.Told in her trademark lyrical prose, Madeline Miller weaves a tale that is at once familiar and brand new. Circe has always been a minor goddess in Greek mythology, but in this book, she shines bright as the star of her own tale. It was fascinating to see so many familiar events\u2014Scylla, Jason and Medea, and the infamous Odysseus\u2014made fresh again through her eyes.You would think a story like this might feel remote and otherworldly and be hard to relate to. After all, I'm not a goddess (well, only in my head). But what's amazing about this story is how utterly relatable it really is. Miller manages to portray Circe in sharp relief, and she is a compelling figure. Her search for purpose and belonging, her loneliness, her mistakes and sacrifices, and ultimately her redemption, all coalesce to drive home her humanity and fragility. It makes for a mesmerizing tale, one I could not look away from.In comparison to The Song of Achilles, I found both to be wonderful in their own right. Which you will enjoy more will depend on personal preference. For me, The Song of Achilles has a better arc just based on source material, with the story relentlessly building up to the Trojan War. Circe does not have the luxury of a huge war at its end, so the story ebbs and flows depending on the current narrative. That isn't to knock Circe, but rather speaks to Miller's masterful skill that she was able to make this story just as riveting as its predecessor.In just two books, Madeline Miller has become a favorite of mine. It must not be easy to take a classic that has been told again and again, and to infuse something thrilling and new into it. Yet she does just that, shaping these myths into tales appealing for the modern audience, while still retaining all of their old-world charms. I cannot wait to see what she comes up with next.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Song of Achilles~~~~~~~~~~~~.", "OH.MY. GOODNESS. WHY? WHY? And WHYYYYY did I wait too long to read this!

This was one of the most amazing, beautiful, intricate, captivating books I have had the pleasure of reading in my entire life. I have been a bookworm since I was barely walking, and yet this book, this gorgeous retelling, has impacted me so profoundly that I genuinely do not know if I will ever be entirely the same.It is a common saying that women are delicate creatures\u2014flowers, eggs, anything that may be crushed in a moment\u2019s carelessness. If I had ever believed it, I no longer did.As a child, I loved Greek mythology, and though I lost some of that knowledge through recent years, when I heard that this story was releasing, I knew I just had to read it. I thought it was going to be the story from Circe\u2019s point of view, but ultimately, I expected it to revolve around Odysseus; I had no idea that I was in for such a treat, though, as he is only a small portion of the immortal Circe\u2019s life. This isn\u2019t a retelling, it\u2019s an origin story, a history, a tale of centuries\u2019 worth of loves and losses, griefs and triumphs.The thought was this: that all my life had been murk and depths, but I was not a part of that dark water. I was a creature within it.From the very start, we see that Circe is so vastly set apart from her fellow gods and goddesses; as a nymph with the reedy voice of a mortal, she is told she is wholly useless, but it\u2019s evident from the beginning that she is this brilliant, clever, strong woman: a force to be reckoned with in every way. I knew I would love her, but I couldn\u2019t have predicted how fast or hard I would find myself rooting for her to succeed. But of course I could not die. I would live on, through each scalding moment to the next. This is the grief that makes our kind choose to be stones and trees rather than flesh.Of course, Circe\u2019s exile on the isle of Aiaia is bound to be an unhappy story, and that\u2019s a common thread throughout Circe: you always know something miserable or painful is on its way, but the moments in between those travesties, and the ways Circe handles the hand of cards life has dealt her, makes it so incredibly worth the ache. Perhaps the greatest thing about watching her struggle is how much relatability it lends to her character; despite being a goddess, an immortal, and a witch, Circe at her core is a spurned woman who has lived too long under the heels of spiteful, power-hungry men, and a wicked society that values beauty over strength. But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.Of course, Circe\u2019s tale is not entirely a desolate one, but her joys are often her curses, as she loves mortals and sees in them the same potential that cursed Prometheus to his rock. Throughout her life, we get to see relationships come and go, and I was enthralled by how incredibly sex-positive and sure of herself she remains. Rather than selling herself away to the highest bidder, Circe\u2019s primary focus is to never let her pursuit of pleasures and companionship win out over her need to be her own person. \u201cIt is not fair,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot bear it.\u201d\u201cThose are two different things,\u201d my grandmother said.It was so enjoyable to watch the different characters cycle in and out of her memories, whether it was Daedalus and his loom, or Hermes and his messages and antics, or\u2014of course\u2014Odysseus, who we saw in a much more realistic light, as Circe portrayed an image of him that was far less heroic or noble than many of the legends would have one believe. There are even mentions of Patroclus and Achilles, and what became of them, though I was pleased to find that prior knowledge of The Song of Achilles was not at all necessary to fully enjoy this book. I would look at him and feel a love so sharp it seemed my flesh lay open. I made a list of all the things I would do for him. Scald off my skin. Tear out my eyes. Walk my feet to bones, if only he would be happy and well.Of all the things Madeline\u2019s writing had to offer me, though, the one that meant the most to me was wholly unexpected: the perfect, beautiful depiction of motherhood through Circe\u2019s relationship with her son. As a mother to a wild little boy of my own, I related to so many of her thoughts and fears, but most of all, to the utter authenticity of the love she describes for him. It consumes her entirely\u2014for better or for worse\u2014and her need to protect him holds such ferocity that she worries it will destroy her at times. Many of the thoughts she held for him gave me chills or brought tears to my eye, and throughout it all, I just kept thinking that I had never felt like motherhood had been so perfectly described as it is in this book. You threw me to the crows, but it turns out I prefer them to you.Truly, I could gush for days, but I\u2019m going to cut myself off here and just ask you to please, please pick up a copy of this beautiful book. I sound like a broken record, but it meant so much to me, and has earned such a warm place in my heart that I know I will reread it over and over in the coming years. Whether you are a mother, or a lover of Greek mythology, or just a bookworm looking for a story that will capture you so wholly, you\u2019ll never want to leave its embrace\u2014this book is flawless, utter perfection, and I cannot possibly recommend it highly enough.All quotes come from an unfinished ARC and may not match the finished release.

Everywhere you turn, you see that magnificent cover (honestly, that cover work is DIVINE and I\u2019ve had the MOST fun photographing it for the Bookstagram). Twitter and Instagram are as we speak packed with Circe references and Miller interviews and, within all of that, Circe has found itself wrapped in all of the fluff and buildup and publicity of a typical ultra-hyped, big-named publisher release. Let\u2019s be serious\u2014most of us LOVE these kinds of releases and all the hysteria involved, even if we shy away from actually reading the hyped release itself. It can be a book lover\u2019s dream--a book with all the fanfare of a blockbuster, silver screen release. I, too, was swept up in the craze, yet another smash hit from the publisher who brought us fan favorites like Twilight and whom I once interned for in London. But, in the end, I couldn\u2019t ride the Circe wave all the way through. Let\u2019s get one thing clear from the very start: Madeline Miller\u2019s follow up to The Song of Achilles is an epic in the years spanned but not necessarily in the execution. To me, it read far more like a long story than an \u201cepic.\u201d When I think of that four-lettered word, I think of a novel that\u2019s monumental and moving. I think of The Odyssey and sweeping sagas like A Song of Ice and Fire, even novels that are gripping and complex, long and treacherous as a Hajj like A Little Life. But Circe did not touch me in that way. In fact, there were moments\u2014those times when the novel resorted to recounting the tales of the mythology we all know so well rather than putting the reader in the moment of these tales\u2014where I was bored to skimming. In Circe, pages upon pages passed of one character telling another a \u201cstory\u201d of others\u2019 happenings, travels and wars: Telemachus telling Circe about Odysseus, Circe recounting the story of Hermes, and on and on. Who wants to hear second- and third-hand about the chronicles of these larger-than-life names within a novel that calls itself an \u201cepic?\u201d I\u2019d rather feel and live the stories of these mortals and gods alike. Wouldn\u2019t you?Circe\u2019s life is a true saga, and Miller\u2019s research and background in the Classics shines through in this novel and serves her well. But, there are gaps between the breadth and notoriety of the mythology she incorporated here and the skill with which the novel was actually written. There is only so far that building a modern-day epic on the backs of known names and legends could go; Miller needed to take us the rest of the way to make Circe a contemporary wonder, to make this a saga all her own. This novel didn\u2019t quite make it across that bridge for me.Circe offered up a world full of color, a world of eternal life and leviathans, of clashing gods and witchcraft, all while tying in mythological tales that\u2019ve been handed down for ages. Perhaps it\u2019s only fitting, in that case, that it was overwrought with linguistic hyperbole\u2014The sound was a piercing chaos, like a thousand dogs howling at once\u2026She beat the cliff-side, howling her frustration. This novel was full of both drama and melodrama, only one of which is necessary for a sweeping epic. Yet, I had to appreciate the scale of story Miller told and the breadth of her knowledge in the Classics. Circe was a great story for sure, but I was never fully moved by how it was told. 3.5 stars.*** FOLLOW ME HERE:Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Get a Copy of My Book | Book Editing, Author Coaching, Submit Your Book to Me .", "\u201dIt was true what Hermes said. Every moment mortals died, by shipwreck and sword, by wild beasts and wild men, by illness, neglect, and age. It was their fate, as Prometheus had told me, the story that they all shared. No matter how vivid they were in life, no matter how brilliant, no matter the wonders they made, they came to dust and smoke. Meanwhile every petty and useless god would go on sucking down the bright air until the stars went dark.\u201dSculpture by Nicolas-S\u00e9bastien Adam in the Lou\u201dIt was true what Hermes said. Every moment mortals died, by shipwreck and sword, by wild beasts and wild men, by illness, neglect, and age. It was their fate, as Prometheus had told me, the story that they all shared. No matter how vivid they were in life, no matter how brilliant, no matter the wonders they made, they came to dust and smoke. Meanwhile every petty and useless god would go on sucking down the bright air until the stars went dark.\u201dSculpture by Nicolas-S\u00e9bastien Adam in the Louvre.Meeting Prometheus in chains, very briefly, before he was taken to the mountain side to begin his punishment had a profound impact on Circe. He had given man fire, and in the process had angered the Gods. He was condemned by Zeus to have an eagle rip his liver from his body each day and eat it over and over again for all eternity. Mortals paid attention to the Gods more when they experienced more suffering. Fire reduced their offerings to the Gods. One might say that fire made them need the Gods less. Gods are fickle, childish creatures in need of constant reassurance. Circe was a daughter of Helios. \u201dAt my father\u2019s feet, the whole world was made of gold. The light came from everywhere at once, his yellow skin, his lambent eyes, the bronze flashing of his hair. His flesh was hot as a brazier, and I pressed as close as he would let me, like a lizard to noonday rocks. My aunt had said that some of the lesser gods could scarcely bear to look at him, but I was his daughter and blood, and I stared at his face so long that when I looked away it was pressed upon my vision still, glowing from the floor, the shining walls and inlaid tables, even my own skin.\u201dShe was the oldest daughter of the nymph Perse, and she was quickly followed by three siblings. When Zeus discovered they were all witches, he ordered Helios to slake his lust elsewhere. Maybe that was when Helios started turning himself into a bull and fucking his herd of precious cows. I\u2019m not sure if that was bestiality or if it deserved some new moniker to describe such perversity. Painting of Circe by Joseph HerrinCirce could never win the approval of her father because she was simply not as beautiful as she should be. Her voice was too thin, like a mortals, and her chin was too sharply made. When I looked at a picture of the Roosevelt family with all those attractive features, broad shoulders, and waspish waists, Eleanor Roosevelt stood out. She was Circe amongst all that beauty. In a normal family, attractive attributes could be noticed about Eleanor, but standing in the midst of the Roosevelts she was a flower with too few petals. Circe\u2019s siblings and cousins made her life a godly hell. They lived forever, and spite and vindictiveness were the slings and arrows of idle hands. She was lonely and made more lonely by the fact that no God would marry her, and mortals were simply not good enough for the daughter of Helios. She was discovering that she had powers. The very witchcraft that made the Gods shift uneasily in their thrones. She could transform an iris into a rose or a bee into a mouse. Then she met the mortal fisherman Glaucos. What she does to him confirmed all the fears that the Olympians had trembled over before. Her powers were a wellspring not yet beginning to geyser. Oh, and she turned the bitchy Scylla into a more representative version of herself. *Shudder*.Circe was banished to the island of Aiaia. *Sigh*. Perpetually misunderstood. I liked the way Madeline Miller tied in Circe\u2019s encounter with Prometheus, who sacrificed eternal torment for humanity, and what would turn out to be her lifetime fascination with mortals. Chicks dig scars, and Circe was no exception. After growing up with Gods whose skin, despite what hazards are encountered, remained unblemished, those scars on mortals were fascinating to her because they told the story of their lives in every livid slash and puncture. They might have worn their scars on their skin, but Circe bore hers on her soul. She wanted to help mortals, but found that usually when she tried to help, she made things worse. Not that there weren\u2019t bobbles in her relationship with mortals. After all, she did spend many years turning them into pigs, but then she was only bringing to light the least attractive part of their inner selves. She may have loved the mortal Odysseus the most, which brought her into conflict with: \u201dShe struck the room, tall and straight and sudden-white, a talon of lightning in the midnight sky. Her horse-hair helmet brushed the ceiling. Her mirror armor threw off sparks. The spear in her hand was long and thin, its keen edge limned in firelight. She was burning certainty, and before her all the shuffling and strained dross of the world must shrink away. Zeus\u2019 bright and favorite child, Athena.\u201dOdysseusOdysseus might have been the cleverest man of his generation, but Circe would have had to be even more clever as she harnessed what power she had to outwit a God that wished to have Odysseus at all cost, but also wished to bring harm to Circe\u2019s son, as well. A wonderful, reimagining of an ancient tale that was deftly brought to life by the assured, clear, precise writing style of a gifted writer and researcher. Don\u2019t tarry any longer. Experience the pleasure of epic triumph and tragedy spun in the threads of Daedalus\u2019s loom and wrapped in the magic that only Circe could conjure.

Still, I find myself being overly cautious when reviewing a Madeline Miller's book, as I can't bring myself to spoil this captivating book in the tiniest possible way for future readers.\"Watching Zeus and Helios negotiate is always good entertainment. Like two volcanoes trying to decide if they should blow.\"With Circe, Miller selects another unique character - just like she did with TSoA - who isn't usually portrayed as a main character. True, she's a lot more popular than Patroclus in Greek Mythology, but until now, I only came across Circe as a villain, normally during a small part or a subplot of other stories. But I assure you, after finishing Circe, she will be one of your all time favorites characters. The story begins with the onset of Circe's life, and then flows through her different life stages using the author's mesmerizing narrative, allowing us to live through all her experiences. Events are described so delicately, and intricately, but never making reader feel the least bit bored. Everything is beautifully written, and you'll feel like being under a spell, fully immersed and devouring every word. \"They never listened. The truth is, men make terrible pigs.\"\"It is youth's gift not to feel its debts.\"The book is divided between major events of Circe's life, each stage getting more interesting than the one before. However, even with all of them been quite interesting on their own, what made me fall in love with this book the most is not the plot itself, but the way Miller narrates everything. It's hard to explain, but there's just something about her style of writing, hooking the reader from very beginning, which has gotten even better than TSoA. You simply can't stop once started. A lot of the times, I found myself reading unusually slow, for I wanted to make sure I'm not missing even the smallest of details.\"That is one thing gods and mortals share. When we are young, we thing ourselves the first to have each feeling in the world.\"\"War has always seemed to me a foolish choice for men. Whatever they win from it, they will have only a handful of years to enjoy before they die.\"For readers who are already familiar with Greek Mythology, portrayal of the Greek gods in Circe is going to be a little shocking. Some of the favorites gods are not going to have their usually interpretation from the viewpoint of Circe. I think it's only fair, as Circe never was a favorite when the stories were about the Greek Gods. On the contrary, I believe it makes things far more interesting.\"Of all the mortals on the earth, there are only a few the gods will ever hear of. Consider the practicalities. By the time we learn their names, they are dead.\"And finally, I believe we have to give the author credit for selecting these amazing vantage points, to view parts of Greek mythology in very original ways. When comparing with TSoA, for me, Circe felt far better, and improved in everyway. So even if you weren't a fan of TSoA, don't miss reading Circe: you're missing out on a lot!. This unforgettable 'autobiography' now has a spot on my all time favorites. And I hope they'll keep on coming the author...\"In a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth.

I can\u2019t wait for her next work already.I guess I can officially say with no reservation that I\u2019m a fan of Madeline Miller\u2019s books now. Many readers have raved about her books for almost a decade now, compared to them, I definitely can be considered a new fan of Madeline Miller. I finished reading The Song of Achilles almost two months ago, and despite my previous hesitancy\u2014I talked about why in my review of the book\u2014to read that book, it blew me away how good it was. Right upon finishing it, I knew I had to give Circe a read as well, and although I slightly loved The Song of Achilles more, I cannot deny that Circe is another incredible book by Madeline Miller.\u201cIt is a common saying that women are delicate creatures, flowers, eggs, anything that may be crushed in a moment's carelessness. If I had ever believed it, I no longer did.\u201d When I was starting The Song of Achilles, I was afraid that my knowledge of Achilles and the Trojan War would diminish my experience on Miller\u2019s take on the story. As it turns out, knowing about Achilles and how his story ended actually deepened my enjoyment of reading that book. When I was going to start Circe, it was the other way around; I knew about Odysseus and his journey, but I admittedly remembered very little about Circe\u2019s tale. In fact, what I remembered about Circe was only that Odysseus met her, and she also turned Odysseus\u2019 men into pigs, that\u2019s it. I was afraid that my lack of knowledge about Circe would actually decrease my enjoyment; there was no need for any worry, after all. Circe is beautiful, empowering, and well-written. \u201cHumbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets. As if there can be no story unless we crawl and weep.\u201d Circe\u2019s characterization is simply wonderful. It was easy for me to find myself invested in her story, and the more I read about Miller\u2019s take on her character, the more I grew to care about her. She\u2019s a kind-hearted and innocent individual who has to learn things the hard way but never let the difficulties, betrayals, and loneliness she faced throughout her life changed her core virtues. Her character\u2019s development was gradually developed. This is also what made Circe such a compelling character to read; she\u2019s powerful, and I\u2019m speaking this not just in terms of her literal power as a witch, but it\u2019s her perseverance, defiance, and strong mentality that I found to be inspiring. The cruel events that have happened to Circe could\u2019ve easily led her to think that all male is evil, but this didn\u2019t happen to her; Circe judged people, regardless of their genders and affiliations, equally through their actions. Good people receive kindness, bad people deserve retribution. \u201cYou have always been the worst of my children,\u201d he said. \u201cBe sure to not dishonor me.\u201d\u201cI have a better idea. I will do as I please, and when you count your children, leave me out.\u201d Greek mythology\u2014along with Norse and Japanese mythologies\u2014are some of my favorite myths to read about. I loved reading Miller\u2019s Greek retellings. After reading The Song of Achilles, it somehow felt comfortable to me to be reading another standalone story by Miller within these eras. It was great to witness Scylla and its origin; Prometheus and his torture; Daedalus and Icarus; Odysseus\u2019 and his family; the Greek gods behaving as childish as possible, and many more. These, and heroic actions, are all the kinds of things that made Greek mythologies fascinating to read, and Miller continues to nail the executions. The part with the Trygon\u2019s Tail was something that I haven\u2019t heard of; this could be Miller\u2019s own rendition on this story section, and it fits the narrative she tells. \u201cYou cannot know how frightened gods are of pain. There is nothing more foreign to them, and so nothing they ache more deeply to see.\u201d Both The Song Achilles and Circe has proved that Madeline Miller is a blessing for literature and Greek mythologies. Feel free to consider me a fan of her books now, I heard that her next novel will be about Pandora, and I\u2019m super excited for it. Honestly speaking, though, I loved reading Miller\u2019s beautiful prose so much that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind if she decides to retell everything in Greek mythologies with her creativity and writing. \u201cBut in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth.

I tried really, really hard to like this book but there was just too many bits that didn't work for me.For the bits that worked: I did really like how the author breathed life into these myths. So many times I pick up a Greek mythology book and I'm puzzled by the actions of the gods and goddesses. They just don't make logical sense but when I read the myths I was familiar with, I was nodding along with Circe's logic and actions. For the bits that didn't work: For the longest time, I had difficulties articulating why I couldn't get into this book.Whenever I reread a tale that I knew involving Circe (i.e. when Homer's Odyssey gets to her island house), I could connect to the book and I was LOVING what was happening on the page.But, if I hit a myth that I didn't know about ahead of time...I felt so...apathetic. It was strange. Cause I could go from being 110% INTO this book to -10%. I don't think I've yo-yo'ed like that in years, if ever.I think, that without knowing the myth that I had a hard time following what was happening. Figuring out who was who and what event was occurring on screen. And all of that went away as soon as I had a decent baseline of knowledge to frame my interpretation of Circe-the-book's version of events.All in all, this book wasn't terrible but I'd definitely recommend being a familiar fan of Circe's tale before picking this one up.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads.", "in the house of miller, goddess of written word and mightiest of storytellers, a masterpiece was born. again, i am blown away at the beauty that is madeline millers writing. her words have a way of invoking a sense of delicate peace in my heart. i read her stories and it fills that longing for something more. circe was an absolute delight from start to finish, and i cant express the extent of my gratitude for something so breathtakingly compelling to have been created and shared with the world. in the house of miller, goddess of written word and mightiest of storytellers, a masterpiece was born. again, i am blown away at the beauty that is madeline millers writing. her words have a way of invoking a sense of delicate peace in my heart. i read her stories and it fills that longing for something more. circe was an absolute delight from start to finish, and i cant express the extent of my gratitude for something so breathtakingly compelling to have been created and shared with the world. \u21a0 5 stars.", "\u201cHumbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets.

I grew up on the Greek myths and if anyone tells me that a book is Greek mythology-inspired, it\u2019s an instant add to my overflowing TBR. #SorryNotSorryMoreover, I love villain origin stories, and as Circe is portrayed as one of the many villains in the Odyssey who stood in the way of Odysseus\u2019 voyage home to Ithaca\u2026I thought that this book would be perfect for me. In addition, Madeline Miller is such a highly acclaimed author, following the release of the tragic love story between Achilles and Patroclus in The Song of Achilles. However, it appears that it wasn\u2019t meant to be. No matter how many five-star ratings this book has received\u2026I just don\u2019t think that they were deserved. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. Miller is a wonderful author, with such a lush writing style that I felt as if I were reading a piece of epic literature. But she made Circe so\u2026boring?I saw a lot of references to Homer\u2019s Iliad, Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, Apollonius\u2019 Argonautica, Euripides\u2019 Medea, and even Telegony (one of the lost instalments of the Epic Cycle, about Circe and Odysseus\u2019 son, Telegonus, that we only have a summary of) and I absolutely LOVED how in depth Miller\u2019s research was. I\u2019m in awe, really. The one that really surprised me was her including storylines from Telegony, as most people haven\u2019t even heard of it because of its status as a lost Greek epic. One would presume that she\u2019d only include the more well-known epics, so I really want to give props to the detail that went into this retelling. Bravo!\u201cI thought: I cannot bear this world a moment longer. Then, child, make another.\u201dCirce is a titaness. A witch, or pharmakis. A mother. A daughter. A sister. A lover. And most importantly, a woman. This is the most feminist interpretation of Greek mythology that I\u2019ve ever come across, and for that, I am truly thankful. Too often, women are the victims or the villains in Greek mythology. Medea is the scorned woman who drives Jason to suicide. Medusa is the evil that Perseus must defeat. Ariadne is the damsel in distress, needing to be saved by Theseus. Helen is the pretty face that \u201claunched a thousand ships\u201d, who leads men like Hector and Achilles to their deaths. Megara is the innocent wife who is killed in a fit of madness by Heracles. Penelope is the faithful wife who awaits Odysseus\u2019 return home. Abused. Raped. Enslaved. Mutilated. Murdered. On and on, countless women are considered to be inferior or insignificant, in comparison with their male counterparts, the so-called heroes. Miller goes on to show that Circe isn\u2019t a strong character DESPITE being a woman. She\u2019s a strong character BECAUSE of it. Miller humanised an often-overlooked villain and empowered her in such a feminist way. Circe\u2019s embrace of her womanhood is both wonderful and painful, dramatic and tragic. And best of all, Circe is unapologetic for it. What a queen.In addition, Circe was definitely\u2026Cirsassy at some points: \u201cYou have always been the worst of my children,\u201d [Helios] said. \u201cBe sure to not dishonour me.\u201d \u201cI have a better idea. I will do as I please, and when you count your children, leave me out.\u201d \u201cFor a hundred generations, I had walked the world drowsy and dull, idle and at my ease. I left no prints, I did no deeds. Even those who had loved me a little did not care to stay. Then I learnt that I could bend the world to my will, as a bow is bent for an arrow. I would have done that toil a thousand times to keep such power in my hands. I thought: this is how Zeus felt when he first lifted the thunderbolt.\u201dIn all honesty, this novel began amazingly and had me entranced. There were so many gods, monsters, and heroes woven into this tale that I recognised. We meet Prometheus and see his punishment for giving fire to the mortals. We see Helios in his divine glory and his white cattle. Daedalus and Icarus also make appearances before they meet their tragic ends. After, there were Scylla and Charybdis, making the waters deadly to all who traversed there. Then, came Pasiphae, the mother of not only Ariadne, but also the Minotaur, who managed to cement herself in history. In addition, there was Aaetes, who also had the gift of witchcraft, but is most notable for fathering Medea \u2013 MY GIRL! Many beloved Olympians also grace Circe\u2019s island of Aiaia, including Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. \u201cThe truth is, men make terrible pigs.\u201dIt was near the middle, where the adventure slowed down, that my interest began to wane and I was projected into a reading slump. The best and arguably most iconic scene is when Circe invites men \u2013 who are lost at sea \u2013 into her home, sheltering and feeding them. While they ask her to kill her pigs for them to eat, she refuses, but does serve them food and wine. After her hospitality, they proceed to thank her by sexually assaulting her, prompting her to transform them into pigs and killing them. The chapter ends in an empowering moment, when she says, \u201cAs it turned out, I did kill pigs that night after all.\u201d You go, girl! After rejecting her divine relatives and disassociating herself with them, she embraces a simple and quiet life on the island that she was banished to, after her powers of witchcraft threatened Zeus. When Odysseus and his men wander upon her island, I thought that the novel would pick back up, much like the faster pace of the beginning, but that did not seem to be the case. If anything, it slowed down even further. Not only did I not enjoy the characterisations of Medea and Odysseus, but I found her daily routine to be a bore. In fact, I even read more than SEVEN novels in between this time. I was THAT unenthused. But the most boring part to me\u2026and I have no idea why\u2026was Circe\u2019s experience with motherhood. I\u2019m not certain if Miller was trying to portray post-partum depression, but I ACTUALLY fell asleep here. It just wasn\u2019t holding my attention. Circe was a pretty awful mother and Telegonus was a terror of a child. Miller said in an interview that \u201cI wanted Circe\u2019s experience of motherhood to speak of things that are often excluded from ancient epics.\u201d Having said that, I wish that Miller hadn\u2019t included it. It\u2019s what dropped this book\u2019s rating from a five-star to a three for me. \u201cHe showed me his scars, and in return, he let me pretend I had none.\u201dI was pretty \u201cmeh,\u201d about Circe\u2019s casual relationship with Odysseus. I much preferred her pure affection for Daedalus early in the book or her mature bond with Telemachus later in the novel. Miller made my hero, Odysseus, to be utterly reprehensible, and she portrayed my favourite ancient Greek figure, Medea, to be a spoilt brat. How disappointing\u2026Regardless, the book turned around in the end, thank goodness. Once Telegonus grew with na\u00efve innocence, bringing Telemachus and Penelope to Aiaia, after having accidentally slain Odysseus, the novel picks back up to its faster pace in the beginning. Penelope finds her own path, Telegonus goes on his own adventure, and Circe and Telemachus travel the world together. The end was extremely satisfying and I was enjoying it so much that I didn\u2019t want it to conclude. In fact, my exact thought upon finishing the novel was, \u201cTHAT\u2019S IT?!!!\u201d If only the middle of this novel was of the same quality as the beginning and the end.From what I\u2019ve heard, Miller is currently writing a retelling of the Aeneid, centred around Dido, the first queen of Carthage, so I\u2019m really excited for that. I\u2019ve never come across Dido in literature, outside of the Aeneid itself, so I can\u2019t wait to see what Miller does with her story. I\u2019m also really hoping for a cameo from Telegonus, as he should be in the general vicinity, as well. So how long do I have to wait? 2020? 2021? Hopefully, not too long!!!.", "Circe is a fine book. I can easily see why many give it 5 stars. And, I imagine that it is very popular with people who enjoy mythology.

I hope if you do give it a try, you find yourself saying, \u201cAH-HA!\u201d a lot.But, then things came to a screeching halt. About halfway through until there was about 5% of the book left, not much really happened. I kept thinking that the adventure and story was just taking a break and would get going again, but it was more of a permanent break. As I previously mentioned being in the minority when it comes to my feelings on this book, I am sure many will have no clue why I felt this way. But, for me, it just flat-lined.If the book had kept things going the same the whole way through, I would have gone 5 stars. Maybe Circe\u2019s life ran out of 5-star material at a certain point so the author did her best to work with what she had. I will emphasize again that, in this case, I don\u2019t want my 3 stars to deter you. There are other times that I would stress proceeding with caution if I give a book 3 stars, but I don\u2019t feel very passionate about that in this case.

So what to do? How to describe my love for this book in words that would do this masterpiece (and yes, in my opinion it truly is a masterpiece) justice? \u201dI felt myself tremble, but I would not let him see it. Great gods smell fear like sharks smell blood, and they will devour you for it just the same.\u201dI guess I might start with what it is not. \u201cCirce\u201d is definitely not like \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d! To be honest those books couldn\u2019t have been any more different even if they tried. Whilst the main topics of \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d were the Trojan War and the undying love *weeps* between Patroclus and Achilles the major themes in \u201cCirce\u201d were her solitary life in exile and her encounter with Odysseus. This setting alone makes for an entirely different story and sets a completely different pace. The tale of Circe is slow and unfolds over time, the many centuries that pass away giving the reader not only a good sense of the change of the world but also an insight to our heroine\u2019s lonely life. Just like the love between Patroclus and Achilles was almost tangible in every single page from \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d Circe\u2019s solitude is palpable in every written line. \u201dI had no right to claim him, I knew it. But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.\u201dThe remarkable thing about her is that she didn\u2019t let it get her down. She might have been in exile and shunned by her family but she never got bitter because of it. Quite the contrary. She took what she had and changed it according to her needs and she adapted to her new life and made the best out of it. And even more important, she defied the gods by doing so. It might have been small gestures and little actions but with every breath she took she refused to give them any satisfaction. Circe was a strong-willed, skilled and formidable woman and I couldn\u2019t help but love her for it! \u201dWe lit no tapers. The room was dark and warm from the day's heat. Shadows draped the bed. No frogs sounded, no birds called. It was as if we had found the still heart of the universe. Nothing moved except for us.\"Despite her bravery and strong will it\u2019s undeniable that she was a very lonely woman though. This however doesn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t know love. There were quite a few lovers and mortals she didn\u2019t only take to her bed but also into her heart and whenever she did it; it left a mark on her soul. Circe loved deeply and gently and she always felt compassion for those men that came to her island and crossed her path. Well, at least until one day that changed everything. \u201dThey moaned and squealed, and pressed their snouts to the earth. We are sorry, we are sorry.Sorry you were caught, I said. Sorry that you thought I was weak, but you were wrong.\u201dAnd tell you what? I could understand her anger and wrath, because I think this was the first time she truly realized what had been done to her. The gods didn\u2019t intervene on her behalf and left her to her own devices instead and the trust she had given to those who had needed her help was betrayed in the worst possible way. Add to that her acute loneliness and you get a goddess that becomes embittered and vindictive. \u201dAnd so,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich do you change, and which do you let go?\u201d\u201cI change them all,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have come to my house. Why should I care what is in their hearts?\u201dHe had smiled and lifted his cup to me. \u201cLady, you and I are in accord.\u201dWho knows what would have happened if Odysseus would have never come to her island? Which kind of person would she have become? I guess we\u2019ll never find out and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s good the way it is. And here comes another scene that brought me immense joy, the moment Circe and Odysseus meet for the very first time. XD Gods, I loved their conversation so much! The tension and the way they tried to gauge each other\u2019s reactions by talking about seemingly simple things! This was so masterfully done, I can\u2019t even! One of the best book moments ever, I swear! <333 \u201dI confess I'm in awe,\" he said, \"they're never so quiet for me. You must have had quite an effect on them.\"I heard a humming, like before a spell is cast. His gaze was a honed blade. All this had been prologue. As if we were in a play, we stood.I\u2019ve always loved Odysseus and I\u2019ve been a huge fan of him ever since I read the Odyssey. I know he is a hero with many flaws and more morally grey than anything else, but this was always the reason why I loved him so much. He\u2019s human, he\u2019s intelligent, skilled, sly, he\u2019s honourable (most of the time) and he knows how to manipulate people in order to get what the wants. Some might say he\u2019s a dangerous man and they\u2019d be completely right with it. So what\u2019s not to love? *lol*\u201dThe world was made of mysteries, and I was only another riddle among the millions. I did not answer him, and though he pretended frustration, yet I began to see that it pleased him in some strange way. A door that did not open at his knock was a novelty in its own right, and a kind of relief as well. All the world confessed to him. He confessed to me.\u201dWell, anyway! Those two meet and they clash! And yes, I savoured every single moment of it. Their conversations were really intriguing and it\u2019s obvious Odysseus had a notable impact on Circe\u2019s life. In more ways than one, I might add. ;-P Considering the circumstances this actually sounded kind of dirty now. *lol* Never mind my particular choice of words. XDConclusion:It\u2019s undeniable that Madeline Miller has a way with words and no matter which kind of story she tells, she always seems to be able to turn it into gold. I loved how she managed to weave so many different parts of Greek mythology into \u201cCirce\u2019s\u201d tale and I adored that our heroine was a constant part of it all. The pacing of the book might have been very slow, but this didn\u2019t take away any of my enjoyment. Whilst the ending of \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d made me ugly cry, \u201cCirce\u2019s\u201d ending had an entirely different effect and gave me a sense of contentment and peace. This was definitely another one of Madeline Miller\u2019s masterpieces and all that\u2019s left to say is that I can really recommend it! ;-)P.S: Last but not least I want to thank the \"amazingly awesome and adorable Aoife\" (yes, that's supposed to be an alliteration ;-P) for buddy reading this book with me! <3 I know our lives didn't make it easy to go through with our BR but it was a lot of fun and I hope we'll go for another one soon! XD_______________________________Let\u2019s start the \u201cHow many books of my TBR 2019 can I pack into the last 5 weeks of the year\u201d challenge! ;-P The first book is \u201cCirce\u201d! Obviously! *lol* I should have read this gem ages ago but I was procrastinating too much and now I\u2019m trying to catch up! XD Since I loved \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d I have no doubt that I\u2019ll enjoy this too. Madeline Miller just has a way with words and I can\u2019t wait to dive into this! Hopefully I won\u2019t be as heartbroken as I was after reading TSoA though. >_<Please be gentle with me, Madeline!

But I\u2019ve decided to go with my personal rating, since that won\u2019t affect the overall strong reviews it\u2019s received. When I view this as a standalone story, Circe starts off strong with a lot of potential to subvert the misogynistic tropes of Greek mythology. The summary makes it seem like an epic story of a goddess standing up for herself, defying her family, and claiming her individuality. The actual results were lacking for my expectations: the plot was quite slow in which she spends majority of the time on her island and having sexual conquests with various men that visit her. There is a lot of name-dropping for other gods and mortals that I did not care for because they did not enhance the story in my eyes. I wish this had been a reimagining instead so that the feminist themes could have been explored more deeply; I would have loved to see the handmaids on her island play a more prominent role rather than read about her sexual conquests with other men, because the concept of an island filled with women who have been exiled by the gods is super interesting and would allow them to reclaim their own power and individuality. I also wish I had seen more resistance from Circe to her family, since the beginning of the story made it seem like she was going to be the black sheep that would overthrow them and made her a great character to root for in that aspect. I felt lukewarm about the story overall because the hype and raving reviews made it seem like an amazing feminist story, but those opportunities were not seized for the sake of staying exact to the source material. Otherwise, I think this would have been a great chance to redefine the genre with an updated reimagining..", "*The gods and their incomprehensible rules.*This is exactly what the book means.

We follow Pat Moore as he tries to make a new life for himself in London.

We stand on doorsteps with Pat as he makes a modest living, and share his thoughts as he re-evaluates the various aspects of his existence. The title reverberates throughout the novel as Pat, and others, find themselves alone in life and in situations.

That said, it is true that this is not a conventionally \u2018enjoyable\u2019 read. Leigh takes a very minimal approach to plot and character development. The focus is all tension and atmosphere. This book makes you think\u2026 but doesn\u2019t tell you what to think. It\u2019s powerfully emotional, but not in the way we are used to, with every feeling articulated and spelled out. Instead it\u2019s a splinter jammed under your skin and left to fester.At its centre is the quest for the (now mythic) tiger, a creature that may as well be the mascot for human devastation wreaked on the natural world. And so, the \u201cTHEMES\u201d and \u201cREFLECTIONS\u201d seem to me to resound much louder now than they would have done 20 years ago, when The Hunter was first published.

As is my want I used to haunt the bookshops, mostly 2nd hand, when I was able. With that I picked up this novel about a hunter looking for the last existing Tasmanian Tiger, or thylacine as it is also known. Apparently this is a novel of a sub-genre called Tasmanian Gothic, or at least that is what the book seller told me. This read is in a dark descriptive style with the fear and dread that Gothic literature entails and to be honest Tasmania is the perfect place to have such a sub-genre. It has a dark history from the days of British colonialism that made Van Diemen's Land a place of convict dread. Add to that the near genocide of the indigenous peoples up to such recent events as the Port Arthur Massacre. On my journeys through the state I am never anything but amazed at the road kill. I sometime think I have seen just about every native Australian creature dead on its roads and that can be a very disconcerting view of the road considering the sheer idyllic beauty of the vast majority of the country side. And as to the thylacine its extinction is debatably caused by human intervention. The authorities once had a bounty on its head because it was considered a sheep killer. Which leads to this strangely dark novel. The major character, an individual called M, is on a disturbing mission to take out the last known thylacine. With that we get a chilling take on his hunters mind. He is a cold and calculated individual who, for most of the time, cares little for anything but his hunt. His generally cold and cool dealings with all he comes into contact with, along with his detached inner thoughts, are methodically told in sparse 3rd person prose that could leave the reader disheartened about the innate indifference of a man. M stays with a family in between hunting that had difficult circumstances. The reader should have had sympathy, and empathy, for the family but a certain cold sparseness in the writing about them made for an almost neutral feeling in terms of any warmth. \u201cA muscular and robust novel, yet with tremendous delicacy\u2026..\u201d says The Australians Book Review. I agree with the term muscular and if I had not known the author was female I would have said this was a very masculine novel. As to delicacy? I have to disagree. The family, for example, were hardly described with any form of delicacy. This all sounds like criticism but it is not meant to be so. I actually think that the author has set out to achieve the effect it has had on me in terms of understanding the Hunters mind so with that it is a worthy read for anyone interested in the subject and the sub genre. Just don't expect to be entranced..", "Under an assumed identity of Martin David, Naturalist, M arrives to hunt down the last Tasmanian tiger rumoured to exist within Tasmania.

On the edge of the wilderness, he will soon slip into an untouched world of silence and stillness. Hunting the last thylacine, an animal extinct since the 1930\u2019s, but a sighting has been reported.Julia Leigh, born in 1970 in Sydney, Australia, has received critical acclaim even though she has had a very small writing career so far. The Hunter in 1999; a novella in 2008, Disquiet; and then she wrote and directed the 2011 movie Sleeping Beauty (not to be confused with the fairy tale). I tend to think that most of her acclaim came from people expecting great things from her after she was selected to be the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winning author Toni Morrison in 2002 as part of the Rolex Mentor and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Arts international philanthropic programme.The Hunter is an interesting novel because it follows a post colonial narrative which is unheard of for an Australian novel. When it comes to Australian adventure novels, most of the time characters just get lost in the wilderness not go hunting dangerous animals. This leads to an interesting portrayal of the thylacine, which I will look at later. The Hunter may be a stripped back quest narrative but it feels very American and masculine for an Australian female author. American in a sense that the hunt narrative could be compared to Moby Dick, Old Man and the Sea and even The Bear, comparisons which she has acknowledged. Masculine in the way she gives approaches this novel with detachment, contempt and control over the death hunt subject matter. You could compare the paired back minimalist prose to something found in hard-boiled fiction, but not quite.M is the archetype of a hunter, a figure that inhabits the story rather than one the lives in its world. There are not too many details of this character, but he seems to have similar characteristics as the hero in a spaghetti western. Ruthless, cold, calculating and inhuman but never unethical; though the lack of character development is an important part of this book. It forces the reader to keep him at arm\u2019s length so we can study him. It\u2019s almost like Julia Leigh has been taking active steps so that we never warm to him.He is never a role model or anti-hero; he is just a faceless man in pursuit of the last remaining thylacine. What does the thylacine represent in this book? Imagination, hope for the future, guilt of the past, living in harmony with nature or a biotech ghost in a Tasmanian gothic novel? It\u2019s up to the reader to decide, but while we are on the subject of the thylacine, does this animal both represents the Australian wildlife, an animal going extinct to raise global awareness as a form of Ecocriticism or is it supposed to be an animal that could harm or kill the hunter? These are the questions that I believe Julia Leigh wants us to ask as readers.Julia Leigh setups a situation where the reader has to reason with their imagination and emotions in order to get the reader to think about what the author might be saying. I really like how you can read The Hunter as an adventure, a Tasmanian gothic or as ecocriticism. No matter which way you read this you are not wrong. I thought of this more as a western; just with the way the protagonist was portrayed and the people drinking in the bar reminded me of those rednecks drinking in a saloon in those spaghetti western films. I\u2019m interested to see how people read this book and just see what they got out of it.The review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/....", "From IMDb:Martin, a mercenary, is sent from Europe by a mysterious biotech company to the Tasmanian wilderness on a hunt for the last Tasmanian tiger.", "(*Tentatively) This was...OK.

This is not your typical hunter though, the purpose of his hunt is not bloodlust or thrill, it's something much more noble, something much more subtle. Because of the nature of the storyline (that's a pun by the way) this book emits a kind of eerie stillness. For the vast majority the narrative is just M and the Tasmanian wilderness and his thoughts therein. Credit where it's due, if this book does one thing well its create the atmosphere of being alone in the Tasmanian wilderness; A snapped twig, a owl hoot perhaps. Even the writing style seems to have the volume turned down really, really low. This could have worked, but rather than creating a tension Leigh just creates a sense of boredom. This doesn't lull you into a false sense of security. It lulls you into somnambulism. It's not that the writing is bad, it's quite evocative in parts, but all it seems to invoke is stillness and silence. Like visiting an abandoned holiday destination on a dismal winter day. There are added complexities. Leigh leaves a lot of the plot misted in uncertainty and I quite enjoyed the books gaps and ambiguities. There are perhaps interesting questions in this book about the nature of human kind's place in the world, specifically in relation to the increasingly small places in the earth we might call 'wilderness'. But these questions are quite subtle, you sort of have to dig for them. This isn't bad in and of itself, but I was often left feeling that some of the concepts in this book could have been explored more fully. You're sort of led halfway down the path. Perhaps that was Leigh's intention, but it feels like she was shying away from complex questions rather than leaving their natures ambiguous. The thing I liked most about this book was that it played with your expectations. I think people who pick it up who identify with 'green' politics will finish it feeling alienated. It may not provide the resolution for which you hoped or expected. All that said, this book was just sort of...average. No character, setting, or aspect of the narrative was quite intriguing enough to leave any significant impression on me. If a friend asked me to recommend a book, Australian, ecological or otherwise.

This turned out to be one of those times when the movie was actually better, though the book is plenty good, too.I've tagged this \"Aussie\" but it actually takes place in Tasmania, where the supposedly extinct thylacine has been spotted. A shady multinational corporation of some kind hires a fixer and sends him to Tasmania with orders to find the thylacine, kill it, take blood and tissue samples, and bring them back. They believe there is something in the animal's biology that will be greatly valuable to them. In the movie, it's a (non-existent) toxin. In the book it's left oblique. This fixer, a hunter known only as \"M\", takes lodging in a ramshackle home where a grieving drug-addled widow and her two remarkable kids--a boy and a girl--live. He introduces himself as \"Martin David\" and gives them the attendant spiel that he is a naturalist from University there to study Tasmanian devils. Much of the book takes place out in the bush, with \"M\" setting his traps, making his observations, marking his maps and so forth. Sounds dull, but it isn't at all. He spends 12 days out, then 2 back at the house, a cycle repeated several times. For a while it seems as if there may be something between the controlled, cold-blooded hunter and the woman, or if not her, then with her kids. But it passes like a breeze and \"M\" remains cold and distant to the end. Does he find the thylacine? That would be telling. I will say that the ending is different in the book than in the movie.

Obsession and masculinity have some moments in here but I am, again, not quite sure what statements are being made in the end. You know how sometimes when you read male authors writing female characters you can tell and not in a good way? I was thinking the reverse thing here that Leigh tries to give us a crude but in that sense regular guy but it didn't always ring 100% authentic to me, a bit too much here and there (as in on the one hand he doesn't seem that interested in relationships and sex but then as soon as the lady of his lodging house talks to him wonders what \"her cunt looks like\", not quite sure I buy that juxtaposition). Then again, the writing has an indeed hypnotic quality, the hunt for the last Tasmanian Tiger, our narrator's thoughts and how he approached his business, his interactions with the family he is staying with during that time: it was all rather intriguing but also aloof in certain way. That's how I would describe this short novel: hypnotic, intriguing, aloof.I expected a kind of wow or click moment from the ending, it is the kind of tiny, quiet novel where you expect the ending to put everything into a specific light and I feel like that didn't happen. Probably just didn't get it but it was not the outcome I expected. I was here for complete downward spiral of our protagonist and we get the start of that but it doesn't go anywhere. I also expected the question as to whether there is an actual Thylacine running in the wild to stay more mysterious.

M\u2019s character is very interesting and draws you, almost like a drug, you want to learn more about him, you want to discover his past but even as we draw closer to the end of the short novel. He is near emotionless and has \u2018cleansed\u2019 his soul of any attachment or relationship to anything. All he feels is the exhilaration of the hunt and this is strengthened through the silence and him reverting to more primitive senses. His relationships with others is also another focal point of the novel. Because he doesn\u2019t feel emotions unlike the family he resides with he can\u2019t form strong bonds with the Armstrong family but through his intelligence, he can deduce how they are feeling and this leads to some very interesting interactions between them. All in all \u201cThe Hunter\u201d is a great read, its bleak and obsolete feel make it powerful and compelling..", "25/04/2019I read this for school and it took me over a month to read it, if that tells you anything about how much I appreciated having this on my reading list.

Page 166 (of the American first edition) \"he pulls out the uterus- intact- a plump slimy thing.\" Thylacines like all marsupials had/have two uteri. The author makes it sound like she believes the thylacine has only one uterus like a placental mammal. Page 166. \"A [thylacine] egg, he knows can be fertilised with the sperm of a semi-compatible organism like a lynx or a wolf.\" WHAT????? A thylacine is a marsupial. A lynx or wolf is a carnivora placental. A wolf or lynx is much more closely genetically related to a sperm whale or a Clydesdale horse or any other single eutherian mammal than a marsupial like a thylacine. Saying spotted quoll or tasmanian devil sperm, maybe with artistic license. But this is totally bonkers. I don't think the author understands the marsupial/placental divide.Page 48. \" Young women were afraid to go for afternoon strolls in case they crossed your [a thylacine's] path. You'd drag babies out of their frilly cots and wolf down frilly girls whole... Really, it's no wonder, is it, that the government of the day offered a one-pound bounty for your hide.\" [ellipsis in original] NO, all wrong. There was never a documented case of a thylacine attacking a person ever. There was no historically documented fear of thylacine attacks. The last place a thylacine would go would be into a human's house to steal a baby. Maybe the author is getting the thylacine confused with man-eating leopards in India. The thylacine was noted for its extreme shyness around people. The bounty was offered for fear it would attack sheep at night. Page 27. \"Maybe he'd wandered off to die, like the leopard found at 60,000 feet on Kilimanjaro.\" While not a thylacine error, this really got me confused. The peak of Kilimanjaro is only 19,341 feet. 60,000 feet is in the mesosphere at more than twice the peak of Everest. Any leopard that tried to live up there would simultaneously have its blood boil, asphyxiate and freeze to death. No wonder he died. I think she means 6,000 feet but another zero crept in.Anyway the book is of middling artistic merit. But as a thylacine lover this book is pure drivel.

Of course the most haunting and almost 'sublime' thing in this novella is the loss of the beautiful Tasmanian Tiger, the thylacine, whom our protagonist here, a nameless hunter is sent by some bio-corporation to find and kill for DNA, Jurassic Park style--the supposed last living tiger (not actually a tiger, a marcupial I think, with a huge jaw, google it). What have we done? The guilt that accompanies the extinction of this animal haunts Australia, we killed them all. Such beautiful creatures, it heartbreaking. Have we learnt much? I guess for many this won't sound interesting but for all my Gothic readings in exotic castles, this strikes me by how easily it wielded suspense -- I also love books that have rythme to them, and deceptively simple writing (I love convoluted 18thC writing too though).

In an attempt to understand the animal\u2019s psyche, M immerses himself in the environment of the Tasmanian highlands, embracing his animalistic instincts, therefore isolating himself from his own humanity.The Hunter by Julia Leigh, is a novel which is follows the Julia Leigh\u2019s The Hunter (1999), an environmentally centred novel, showcases Martin David\u2019s, or M\u2019s, tracking of the last remaining Thylacine in the Tasmanian wilderness in order to harvest its genetic material (Hughes-d'Aeth 2006, p.19). In an attempt to understand the animal\u2019s psyche, M immerses himself in the environment of the Tasmanian highlands, embracing his animalistic instincts, therefore isolating himself from his own humanity.The Hunter by Julia Leigh, is a novel which is follows the journey of Martin David (M), as, on appointment by \u2018The corporation\u2019, a biotechnology company, he travels to Tasmania in order to hunt, and eventually slaughter, the last remaining Thylacine in order to harvest its genetic material. Under the guise of a naturalist studying \u201cthe devils\u201d in Tasmanian high country (Hughes-d\u2019Aeth 2006, p.21), M uses the home of Jarrah Armstrong, a naturalist who disappeared whilst searching for the Thylacine, as his base camp. As a result of this, M develops a relationship with Jarrah\u2019s children, Sass and Bike, along with his wife, Lucy, who since his disappearance, has become reliant on inebriants in order to cope. The biographical narrative is split into two sections, one detailing M\u2019s arrival in Tasmania and his initial voyages into the wilderness and the second occurring after M\u2019s return from an eight-week hiatus to the mainland, both of which take place in chronological order from the perspective of M. The character Martin David alienates himself from the constrains of humanity in order to transition into the \u201cnatural man\u201d.Although M is initially drawn to the concept of rescuing the struggling Armstrong family, he alienates himself from his feelings, choosing to focus solely on his mission to capture the Thylacine. Due to his interactions with Lucy, Sass and Bike, M adopts the role of Jarrah within the family, a natural man possessing the ability to \u201clisten as well as talk\u201d (Hughes-d\u2019Aeth 2006, p.24), contented with domestic life along with the masculinized wilderness asserted by his name. Soon, M becomes enamored with the idea of being the family man, romanticizing the idea of domesticity, \u201calways look[ing] forward to hovering over the steaming stove\u201d (Leigh 2011, p.72). However, according to Brewer (2009, p.6), \u201cthe house\u2026is\u2026never straightforwardly idealised as a refuge from the hunt\u201d, serving both as a place of human solace and of \u201ca continuation of the battle: \u2018he returns from the front line, only to find himself in the blood-soaked, rat-infested trenches\u2019\u201d. Like the Armstrong home, which is engulfed by \u201cweeds, mainly a sunny yellow ragwort\u201d (Leigh 2011, p.5), M recedes back into nature, estranging himself from his self-imposed conflicting feelings surrounding the family. Additionally, within the novel, M is likened to the lead character of the Terminator film series (Hughes-d\u2019Aeth 2006, p.25), a hero with the emotional sterility of an android. This is apparent through M\u2019s literal termination of his relationship with the family. This is acknowledged through Leighs use of the Terminator II catch phrase: \u201c\u2019So you\u2019ll be back soon,\u2019 says Lucy. \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll be back\u2019 mimics Bike in a thick German accent\u201d (Leigh qtd in Hughes-d\u2019Aeth 2006, p.25). As communicated by Leigh (Leigh qtd in Hughes-d\u2019Aeth 2006, p.26), \u201c[M] comes to think of his fondness for Lucy and the children as an aberration, a monumental lapse in judgement, and his vision of growing old and happy in a bluestone house seems to him near laughable . . .\u201d. Thus, by alienating himself from his human emotions, M allows himself to fully embrace his animalistic nature. In order to locate the Thylacine, M alienates himself from his own humanity, opting to physically and mentally metamorphise into his target. This change first occurs through M\u2019s rejection of the established world, also known as, the \u201cdecrepit amalgam of fast-food joints, demountable housing, weeds, and rusted out car wrecks\u201d (Hughes-d\u2019Aeth 2006, p.21), withdrawing into Thylacine\u2019s natural environment: the Tasmanian highlands. He makes \u201chis home between the boulders\u201d in which he presumes is the Thylacines lair, gradually forming a boundary made solely of animal carcasses, \u201cfence posts at the back of his lair\u201d (Brewer 2009, p.4). M refers to the den as his own further asserting his transition from man to beast. The fluidity of M\u2019s identity is further emphasized through his dream-like physical metamorphosis into the Thylacine (Leigh 2011, p.91):Lying there on the hard ground inside his tent he performs his favourite trick: he changes shape, swallows the beast. The eyes in his head are no longer his own, short thick fur runs along the back of his neck, and his spine grows thick and strong, right out of his back, out into a long stiff tail. He hangs his body off this strong spine, hollows out his belly, shrinks his gangly limbs. His arm is bent at the elbow, and a paw, not a hand, rests against his bony convex chest. Said transition of M\u2019s physical self leads to his mental transformation into the Thylacine, disregarding the human ability of free thought, embracing the beast\u2019s fatalistic mentality, for \u201che does not want to open his mouth\u2026 he wants to listen\u201d (Leigh 2011, p.107). Given M\u2019s shifting identity, he becomes estranged from the experience of being a contemporary human being, therefore, like Pilgrim becoming an \u2018alien\u2019 within human society.ReferencesBrewer, S.R., 2009.

I absolutely abhor overwrought prose that reads like the author sat down with the intention of writing the next Great American Novel and therefore had a certain number of adjectives and metaphors to fit on each page to prove their work was worth the accolades it was sure to get with sentences like: \"Swamp water is still and dark, having swallowed the light inits muddy throat. Even night crawlers are diurnal in this lair. There are sounds, of course, but compared to the marsh, the swamp is quiet because decomposition is cellular work. Life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff; a poignant wallow of death begetting life.\"There is beautiful imagery, and then there is pretentious cobbling together of SAT words and figurative language so it seems deep but really isn't. For me, this was the latter. And so much of the book is just that overly flowery language barfed over every page for no reason, saying nothing or not making a lick of sense with what it does say. But it sounds pretty! So! Art!Then there was the massive eye-brow raising I did when I discovered this was taking place in North Carolina. The dialect. AGHHHHH!!!! This is why authors shouldn't use dialect when they write. You have to know a place so well in order to do that. Southern hick does not equal southern hick does not equal southern hick. There are (at the very least) five different dialects spoken in North Carolina. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone. The majority of my professors could tell which region each NC native was from by a couple sentences. I had a few who could get within two counties of where they were born after hearing them speak. Yeah. Kya's father's dialect would be exceedingly different from everyone else in their community as he is from the mountains and they are in the Outer Banks. Those are so distinctive and nothing alike. No one else in the world speaks like the Pamlico Sound people of NC. And it is rather hard to capture its cadence and brogue on page so just don't try. You will fail. (Owens totally failed.) Is that nit-picky? Maybe. But I'm more concerned with how the dialect was used. Every \"good\" person in the book overcame their dialect to learn to speak \"proper\" (ugh I hate even typing that word) English. Are you telling me Kya, who didn't have TV or radio as influence, lost her dialect with no practice and no outside influence because she was just...smart??? Good???? Same with Tate. But Chase kept his so we knew he was bad and a threat. There's some classist nonsense imbedded deep in that, and I am not here for it in any way. It's particularly annoying as it reads the way I imagine people pretend to speak when they're speaking \"southern hick\" to be mockingly superior but have never actually heard a real human in the south speak.**Then I reached the part on p57 where Kya's dad says of his family:\"They had land, rich land, raised tobacco and cotton and such. Over near Asheville. Yo' gramma on my side wore bonnets big as wagon wheels and long skirts. We lived in a house wif a verandder that went a'the way around two stories high. It was fine, mighty fine.\"I actually took a screenshot and sent it to my husband who was born and lived his entire life \"near Asheville\". His response, \"What in the world?\" What in the world indeed. A. No one from western NC talks like this. And Kya's father didn't move to the OBX until he was an adult, so he would still have his home dialect. Any student of language knows you don't shed and switch an accent easily once you're in adulthood. It takes practice. And even then the results are dodgy. Also this is not how Pamlico people speak anyway. See my rant about dialect above.B. Does Owens know Asheville is in the mountains??? (Tobacco was grown in the mountains though not nearly as much or as successfully as in the Piedmont. Cotton is waaaayyy harder. It gets too cold and rains too much. Also there's just not enough flat, arable land to make it worth the effort. I know there was a cotton mill in Asheville at the time, but I've never heard about people growing the cotton around there. If they were, it had to have failed more than half the time and not because of weevils. It's just not hot enough long enough. And no one was getting rich off agriculture and building plantation style houses there with slaves as was mentioned later in the book. Western NC was not like the Deep South. Because it is MOUNTAINS. Anyone who has ever driven to Asheville from the Piedmont knows exactly how mountainous. It's like flat flat flat whoa we're going UP. There's not enough flat land for plantations.) Then there was the part where Tate's mom went to ASHEVILLE for a bike because they didn't have it at the local store. Like WHAT??? She didn't try Wilmington? She drove past Greenville, Raleigh (the capitol), Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, missed exits to CHARLOTTE (the largest city), to drive up a mountain for a bike? Literally no other city in NC had it? it takes SIX HOURS to drive from the Pamlico Sound to Asheville on a good traffic day in the year of our Lord 2019. Do you know how long it would've been in the 50s??? Good Grief, what is this woman's obsession with Asheville? And does she believe it is somewhere near the coast rather than on the complete opposite end of a rather long state?Which is how I knew no matter how smart she sounded or how much she might know about science and wildlife, Delia Owens didn't bother to research squat about North Carolina. Or she did and then disregarded it for whatever reason. Maybe she thought the Outer Banks and Asheville as NC's top tourist destinations were the names she needed to drop to make her book sound authentic??? \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Huge parts of the novel are a giant snooze fest of nature this nature that and here's some more nature. And also grits. Because this is SOUTHERN y'all. In case it hasn't been hammered in yet.There were some freakin' awkward sexual scenes. Then there were the long drawn out court scenes that were just so tedious. I gathered from these scenes Owens is also unclear about travel times from the Greenville to the OBX. (Also I\u2019m not sure if there ever was a Piedmont Hotel in Greenville, which is in the coastal plain and not the Piedmont. However, there IS one in Waynesville, which is also not in the Piedmont. Waynesville is in the mountains near.....guess where....Asheville.) Someone buy the woman a freakin\u2019 map since she clearly doesn\u2019t know what Google is. The working of the town vs Kya also bothered me. It's like Owens knows that the OBX people are a difficult community to become a part of without truly understanding the whys and hows of it all. Kya's character development was just so frustrating overall. And some of the stuff she accomplishes requires a tremendous suspension of disbelief. Owens definitely wanted the reader to see her a certain way. She is a manic pixie dream girl in a marsh until suddenly she isn't...(view spoiler)[ I was SO MAD about that. Because I hate when men write manic pixie dream girls. But when women do it? I'm enraged. Way to take it to your own gender. Then it turns out Kya should have a shirt that reads, NOT YOUR MANIC PIXIE DREAM GIRL in fluorescent letters. When I got to the end, I was so angry. Because the Kya we got a glimpse of those last couple of pages, WHER THE HECK WAS SHE THE ENTIRE BOOK? I want to read a book about that complicated, brilliant girl and recognize her as such through the whole thing. Ugh. Give me the Kya who can cold-bloodedly commit a well thought out murder, convince a jury she didn't, make a good portion of the community feel guilty for even suspecting her in the first place, and live a happily contented life forever after. It would have been way more interesting than what came up to that point. I FEEL SO CHEATED. And you know it's just because Owens wanted the element of surprise. But it wasn't really THAT surprising. Why wasn't I allowed to appreciate Kya for the vengeful goddess she was in planning that and executing it beautifully. Don't give me this knowledge with no insight AFTER SHE'S DEAD. Let me SEE ALL OF THAT.  (hide spoiler)]And finally rant-wise, Owens doesn't seem to know quite what she wants this book to be. Is it an ode to nature? Is it a crime novel? Is it literary fiction? It's kind of like she wanted to write the crime novel but genre writing is too plebeian, so here comes the overwrought language and navel gazing. Because ART. The nature part was her falling back on what she was comfortable with I think. *Crayfish do, I learned from my research, make a noise but we don't often hear it as they can make it underwater as well as out of water. It sounds like tap dancing. No singing even remotely flirted with. Where the Crawdads Tap Dance doesn't have the same ring I guess. And also doesn't narrow things down geographically. I did wonder why it wasn't called Where the Cicadas Sing. Because those sing. And are on a 17 year cycle. Which would have fit PERFECTLY with the timeline of the book. So color me confused. I know NC can be overrun with cicadas, but I'm not sure if the Pamlico region has them or not. Still would have made more sense than the actual title. (Again, it sounds flowery and important. Doesn't mean it has depth or meaning.)**My husband decided at age 13 to get rid of his accent. He worked long and hard at it. He did it by listening to network TV anchors and copying their speech patterns. It took years of concentrated effort. It's still not completely gone though he can pass for not being southern in other parts of the country. And when he's home? It comes back full force with all its dialectic eccentricities. I've lived the majority of my life in the Southern Appalachian mountains. Everyone here still knows I'm an outsider the second I open my mouth despite the fact my midwestern relatives swear up and down I have an accent now. And people here in eastern Tennessee are uncertain about my husband because he sounds kind of like them but not quite. (He's let his accent come back more since settling here because it helps with the not being considered an outsider. That's as important in southern Appalachia as it is in the OBX if you want to be embraced by the community.) But a single gorge changed the dialect between eastern TN Appalachian and western NC Appalachian just enough natives here recognize his accent as being not quite theirs. BY THE WAY my husband was just as smart after training out his accent as he was when he had it at its thickest. He knew he needed it gone to be a journalist, so he got rid of it. He was literally asked to \"speak southern\" by people in Michigan when we lived there briefly more than once so they could laugh about it. Which is f***ed up. Southerners speak the way they do for cultural and geographical reasons and it has nothing to do with the amount of intelligence or righteousness they have..", "9/8/20 note: Dear Goodreaders, If you loved this book, I'm very happy for you.

So I won't be joining conversation in the comments. If you disliked this book, you may enjoy having some company in your opinion. --Betsy RobinsonThe Review (November 18, 2018)Normally I would not finish let alone review a book I disliked as much as I did this one, but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club, I\u2019ve decided to say what I think:I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully split\u2014almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case, since the author\u2019s an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya, left alone in the marsh to fend for herself, starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul\u2014I loved, felt, and smelled the land, sea, air, and dense plants. But when people started talking, the writing became stilted, overwritten, and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad, and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids\u2019 scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned, like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version of Law and Order, where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example, a deputy says to his sheriff:\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go by the diner on the way out there.\u201d \u201cWell, get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town\u2019s pretty riled up. Chase Andrew\u2019s murder\u2019s the biggest thing\u2019s happened \u2019round here, maybe ever. Gossip\u2019s goin\u2019 up like smoke signals.\u201d\u201cWell, keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne\u2019er-do-wells can\u2019t keep their mouths shut.\u201d(61)Why not just, \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime? In real life, people do not say everything they\u2019re thinking or narrate everything that\u2019s happening or is going to happen. In fact, most of us lie about what we really think\u2014if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts, leaving gaps in truth, and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.I found the character development absurd: Simply put, there are no authentic, complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat, which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances, one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated, sophisticated, poetry-reciting biologist, knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard, etc., and the other, a sexual relationship where she doesn\u2019t even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.I finished this book by skimming large sections, starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent, sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun, but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya\u2019s character. Sorry, friends who adore this book, I\u2019m an outlier on this one, I guess..", "Seeing as to how I skipped most of the second half of the book, I have no choice but to give it one star.There are so many things wrong with it, I hardly know where to start.

Courtroom drama? Murder mystery? I rather suspect that the author had the idea, first and foremost, to weave a story around how human behavior imitates that of wildlife, was fascinated by the marsh area of NC and fashioned a story around this. As a result the book neither flies nor swims. We might, on one page, get a lot of scientific information about insects, birds and plants, then we are back to the romance style of \u201cher cheeks burned,\u201d \u201cher groin throbbed as if all her blood had surged there.\u201d \u201cher long hair trailing in the wind\u201d and \u201che reached out and ran his fingers across her firm breasts.\u201d Did I mention that she had black hair and red lips? And that she spontaneously recites poetry out loud on the beach?Some books have unlikely coincidences, some have downright contrived ones and others have those that are highly unlikely and therefore plain unbelievable. In the first and second cases, a book can still make it if the characterisations, settings and plot are well done. In the third case, unless you are talking about a fairy tale, you have to be either really romantically minded or you just go along with whatever for the sake of entertainment. \u201cCrawdads\u201d falls into the third category.It is rather unbelievable that, even with an abusive and alcoholic father, the rest of the family would simply abandon their six-year old daughter and sister, unless they were totally depraved, which the author portrays them as not. It is unbelievable that not one single adult in the nearby town would know that the girl was in the marsh by herself and thus make some effort to help her. I will put the rest of the \u201cunbelievables\u201d at the bottom in a spoiler alert. Aside from them, there are the errors and other annoying facets.Such as the author\u2019s use of the vernacular, but only for the bad folks. The good folks all speak proper English. Such as the author\u2019s fascination with southern food, especially grits, black-eyed peas and turnip greens, which are mentioned ad-nauseum.Spoiler alert: Unbelievable that the girl, who did not learn to read until age 14, would then go on to become a self-educated scientist and artist and even write several books, all while being entirely on her own in the wilds. It is unbelievable, since she wasn\u2019t that far from town, that she would never seek out any contact with anyone besides her two suitors and an old black couple. Especially since she was a \u201clooker\u201d and wore white cut-off jeans (really??) when she went to town to buy groceries. How could everyone be so mean to her unless she was plain weird (which we are assured she was not). No, it was that all the town\u2019s people were just narrow-minded and mean\u2026except for of course the one golden boy with the golden locks..", "All the Stars!!!!!Can I just say that I loved everything about this book and leave it at that!?!Where the Crawdads Sing is a story of resiliency, survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, desperation, prejudice, determination and strength.

Soon, all her siblings followed suit, leaving Kya alone with her often absent, drunk, and abusive father. She is left to care for their home, to cook, clean and take care of both of their needs. How her situation pulled on my heartstrings. She had to learn to shop, to cook and to provide food for herself in her father's absence. All while dealing with loneliness, feelings of abandonment and loss. Always wondering when and if her Mother will ever return.

There are several characters who give and show kindness including, Tate, the cashier who gives back too much change and the couple who make sure Kya has what she needs. What is the saying? Those that have the least to give, give the most! There is a police investigation and court room drama and some twists and turns I did not see coming.This book is beautifully written and contains poetry and vivid descriptions of the Marsh.

Here you\u2019ll find sentences that read like poetry, with a lyrical rhythm that sways the reader like the gentle rocking of a boat. Yet it is not showy nor over-the-top --- but pretty perfect. Owens doesn't tell us what to think, but alludes to each message through writing so alive you can almost hear it breathing. She carries us through her dense, atmospheric tone and persuades us to seek and find; discover and examine, all on our own. She allows her striking imagery to guide us as the marsh has guided Kya, and I felt as though I could smell the sea and taste the sweetness of new love.

My apologies to everyone who loved this, but unfortunately, I did not, and no one's sadder than me.Reading Where the Crawdads Sing was like stepping back in time to high school, when class-assigned books meant lots of award-winning fiction. Sure, there were plenty of literary merit found in these pages, but little joy was actually experienced from reading them.Starting at the age of six, Kya was slowly abandoned by everyone in her family, until she was the sole person left living in a little shack at the edge of town. As the years went by, shunned by the entire town, she slowly became known as the \"Marsh Girl,\" a wild and lonely creature that few knew and most feared. This is her story. And when the town's golden boy dies, old prejudices flair up, and Kya finds herself at the receiving end of the town's anger and suspicion.This story is descriptive prose at its most verbose, and no detail\u2014the marsh, waterways, bugs, trees, animals, and sea shells\u2014was too small to be included. But the story has little plot and even less character development. Especially in the beginning, when Kya didn't talk to or interact with a single person, the monotony of the writing almost did me in.The other big issue is that the story is pretty hard to believe. We're supposed to accept that Kya is able to fend for herself, which includes cooking, cleaning, going to the store, buying things, and coming up with ways to make money, all at the age of six. That is way beyond the realm of possibility, let alone probability. There's only so far my beliefs can be suspended, I tell you.That's not to say I didn't enjoy a single thing here because I did. I found the middle of the book to be the most engaging. That was when Kya started interacting with others and the writing became a little bit more interesting as a result. Tate and Jumpin' were my favorite characters, and every scene they were in grabbed me. But the juxtaposition of their scenes (alive and compelling) against the ones without them (descriptive and unchanging) made the latter feel even more dull and plodding by comparison.In the end, this book just isn't for me. Everything that others loved are all the same things I didn't. I prefer my books to have interesting plot advancement, nuanced character growth, and zippy writing, none of which this book had. Instead, the plot is straightforward, the characters all remain stubbornly the same throughout, and the writing is long-winded enough to deflate even the most enthusiastic of readers..", "I seem to be finding myself in the minority a lot these days.

Anyway, after my attempt at weak humor, let me resume in a serious note to say I was expecting so much more than I got here.Kya is a mere ten years old in 1952 when she is deserted, albeit gradually, by all the members of her family and left to make it alone in the marsh country of North Carolina. She forms a real attachment and understanding of her environment, which would be a necessity to survive in such a place, and she mostly works that to her advantage. When a young man who was once a friend of her brother finds her alone and begins to offer some help and company, she learns to read and her life begins to take a turn toward something more than isolation and running barefoot through the woods.That part of the story was interesting to me. I was interested in how she would survive, whether she would connect with the outside world, and of course how she would tie into the parallel story of the 1969 murder of a young man from the neighboring town. Then, in what seemed an abrupt change of tone, the story devolved into what I would deem chick lit. The plot became shallow and the author seemed to me to have lost the thread of her story and veered into another realm.I am sorry this didn\u2019t work for me. I wanted it to, indeed I thought it was going to. Perhaps it is me. Since it is a group read, I am anxious to see what the other members of the group saw that perhaps I did not.I had originally rated this a 3-star read, but after reflection I find that I strongly feel it was only \"OK\" and therefore I have revised the rating to 2-stars.

The author is a nature writer and those sections were undoubtably well-written. But I don\u2019t care for overly descriptive writing. And then there's poetry. I skipped over those as well. Everything other reviewers say they enjoyed were things I intensely disliked. I struggled with believability. I won't list them all, but the implausibility of every single plot point was something I couldn\u2019t get past. To make things worse, romance is not a genre I enjoy and the romance in this book had a very YA feel to it. Finally, I found the use of dialect distracting to read and often in the same paragraph a character would switch from local dialect to proper English.Sometimes my love of the story or the strength of the writing is enough for me to ignore implausibility and move past a few things I don't like. This wasn't one of those times.Recommended for readers who enjoy long, descriptive nature writing, and those who have no trouble suspending disbelief.

She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn\u2019t come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gulls not wanting them to fly away and leave her too. Heartbreaking how she is neglected and abandoned, remembering the beatings, trying to figure out a way to eat. Atmospheric is an understatement, and I don\u2019t use that word often because it seems overused sometimes but this place, the marsh permeates just about everything that is meaningful in this story beginning with Kya\u2019s realization \u201cAnd the marsh became her mother.\u201d The marsh becomes her life, her livelihood, the essence of who she becomes through her self learned expertise of the insects and the birds, her art.

I love the writing, fabulous descriptions of the marsh. The marsh and its inhabitants, the insects, the fish, the birds which pique Kya\u2019s curiosity, give her so much joy and company, and allow her to become the expert she does become on the marsh and marsh life. But is that enough to make Kya whole after so much hurt and loneliness?There\u2019s a murder mystery, not my usual fare, but I was totally engaged, trying to come up with who the murderer was, totally engaged in the courtroom scenes.

I don\u2019t often cry over books, but this one definitely brought me to tears at a number of places. Overall it was such a fabulous read, heartbreaking in so many ways, with wonderful writing and characters, a stunning portrait of a place, of the trauma of loss and loneliness. My heart was always broken for Kya, a character to remember. An unforgettable ending. This was a monthly read with Esil and Diane and as always I appreciate their thoughts as we read together.

I was entertained by the story and found it very easy to follow. It was a bit of historical fiction with some mystery involved eventually rounding off with a little courtroom drama. One of my favorite phrases to use when applicable is that \u201cheart-strings were pulled\u201d, and there was definitely some of that happening here. I think if you like a good, well-told story you will like this one. Who do I recommend it to?Historical fiction fans for sure. Especially those interested in mid-20th Century American fiction. Issues of race and public perception at that time are key to the plot.I am not sure there was enough mystery/courtroom drama to interest fans of those genres if that is specifically what you are looking for. But, there is enough if you just need to satiate a small hunger.Also, while only a little steamy at times, I think fans of stories with some romance will enjoy this one. Again, if you need a lot of hot a heavy in your romance, you will not find it here, but the relationships in the story should be of interest.Should you read it?I feel like this story has a little of a bunch of genres and not too much of any. Because of this, I think it will appeal to a wide audience. So, if you have seen the hype in your feed, too, and have been wondering, I think you should try it out.

For me to rate a book five stars it has to give me something bout of the ordinary, make me feel. Most of all it has to be a book or contain a character or characters that I won't forget. Above all it has to make me feel. This book did all three. Kya, aka Catherine Clark, the Marsh girl is an unforgettable character, abandoned by her mother at she six, her siblings shortly after. By ten she was alone in the Marsh raising herself, her main source of comfort the natural life found in the North Carolina Marsh, the gulls she fed daily. She learned not to trust nor depend on anyone but herself. She was smart, curious, feArless and so lonely. As if this character wasn't enough to remember, there are also some supporting characters that play an integral part in her life. Jumpin and Mabel, a black couple that try to help Kya in whatever way she will accept. Tate, who has known her since she was small, teaches her to read anc much more. What will one do in the face of such loneliness? How much will they sacrifice if they reach out, trust? Prejudice is a big theme, because as the Marsh girl she is considered illiterate, unclean, and none in the village reach out to help. There is of course a villian, who claims to love her, but marries another, breaking her heart . This is there another thread comes in, a story told in alternate chapters, as when he is murdered , she is accused. Also where another wonderful character comes in, a man, 74 years old, a retired lawyer who comes out of retirement to defend her against a town that already assumes she is guilty.I could nitpick a few things, but I won't. I loved and learned much about the natural world, a different way of looking at things. On walks I take along the river I will look at things I ordinarily wouldn't. A survival story, what Kya has to do it not easy, but since she has little choice it is what she does. Making the most of what one has, regardless of how little.

Absolutely wonderful descriptions.The author does a magnificent job creating the character of Kya, with details that make her come alive on the page. This book would have worked fine just as a coming of age novel minus the mystery of the murder.The insertion of the secondary plotline is disruptive and breaks the flow of the story. Part of the problem is the dramatic shift in voice from Kya to the sheriff. Kya is handled masterfully, the sheriff, not so much. These disruptive scenes are kept short but they are still speed bumps that urged me to put the book down. The author is a wonderful craftsman. At about page 150 the author wanted to emphasize one part of a scene and shifted from past tense to present tense just for a few paragraphs. The transition and its impact were wonderful, and done so well it was practically invisible.The story is character driven which is my favorite kind of book, however when handling the mystery part of the story, the protagonist doesn\u2019t dig up the clue. Two different witnesses at two different times, and long after the crime has occurred, comes forward and says, \u201cOh, I might have seen something that night. I just didn\u2019t think it was important.\u201d For me this too is a minor distraction but it could have easily been avoided. The character voice matures as the character gets older and is real and believable. This is difficult to do and the way it is done here is truly an art form.I all but put the book down three quarters of the way through when the murder case was described. I just couldn\u2019t buy it. The quick alternating scenes in that last quarter of the book, the jail and court scenes too often disrupted the fictive dream and tossed me out of the story. There is a definite tone change that comes from a shift in the craft. The voice is lost with the shifting from character to character, too many points of view. And the use of clich\u00e9\u2019s like \u201cI walked into a door,\u201d and \u201cI jus\u2019 didn\u2019t fall off a turnip truck.\u201d didn\u2019t match the wonderful craft in the first three quarters of the book. It almost feels as if the ending had not been planned, or more likely was rushed.The ending was predictable because of the way the protagonist pov was handled (or avoided), and that there really wasn\u2019t any other possibility, no red herrings to choose from so it left only one possible outcome. There wasn\u2019t twist at the end. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all.

Kya will face a challenge like no other, and her fate will rest in the hands of the residents of Barkley Cove, with folks who have taunted her, shunned her, and judged her, her entire life.In 2016-17, there were several stellar novels written, which centered around children or teens raised in a turbulent, \u2018off the grid\u2019 environment, living in harsh conditions and under the care of an unreliable, or unstable father. While they were all quite compelling and effective, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to tackle another one with a similar theme. Yet, with more and more high praise pouring in and one stellar review after another posted by readers, I began to regret my decision to pass on this one. So, obviously, I succumbed, and checked it out of the library. I never doubted the book would be a good one, I just didn\u2019t know if I had the emotional strength right at this moment to tackle the topics of abuse and neglect. But as it turns out, this story isn\u2019t really about the escape from an unconventional upbringing, or about the harsh survivalist or endurance skills needed to cope with an unforgiving landscape, as I had originally thought. While the story certainly drives home the cause and effects of abandonment and the cycles of domestic abuse and violence, this is also a very tender coming of age tale, a story of survival, but also a story of real friendship, true love, and what it means to truly feel free. Kya suffers a great deal of heartbreak, even from unexpected sources, but seems to have resigned herself to a way of life she believes is really her only true option. But, all of it is threatened when a body is found in the marsh, and Kya\u2019s life is suddenly under a white-hot spotlight. The author does a fantastic job with the ecological descriptions and drawing the reader into the beauty Kya sees in her environment. The rich characterizations, especially with Kya\u2019s character study, is another area in which the book excels. There are layers of thought -provoking topics, and a stunning revelation that knocked my breath out, but for those who are sticklers for realistic fiction, this one stretches the boundaries of plausibility in many places. However, you should allow yourself to go along with it, because that is part of the beauty of fiction, and it is well worth any required suspension of belief. Ultimately, I was exceedingly glad I gave this book a try. It was everything I knew it would be, but it was a lot more than I anticipated. As a fan of courtroom drama, I enjoyed the trial scenes, and the mystery elements, but of course it is Kya who stole my heart and made me feel envious for to the kind of freedom and way of life she willingly sacrificed so much to maintain. 4 stars.", "**CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE IN 4 DAYS*** Oh how beautifully mesmerizing this book is.

Well as to the plot I will give you a little information on that, although you\u2019ve all probably read the book blurb.

Then slowly throughout some years her older siblings leave and then finally her brother whom she was very close to and her drunken father. They leave her completely alone in their falling down shack, no provisions and barely any clothing. She was only 14, she was completely alone and had no idea how to survive, but somehow she does. She has an incredible will and she loves the marsh, it\u2019s the only home she\u2019s known. She learns to fish, cook and clean just by remembering how it used to be. Barkley Cove, where she goes for groceries and gas has a store that is run by an extremely kind and generous couple who have lived on the marsh their entire life. She exchanges mussels and then smoked fish for gas for her motor and a few groceries. Mabel gives her used books, shoes, anything that she can get donated. They were her only friends.Kya has two real love relationships in the book. Tate she has known all of her life but now that she is older she views him differently, she begins to feel real love. He teaches her how to read which opens up the world to her. He is in her life for quite a few years and she seems happy, her life is good. She loves the marsh and all that inhabit it. She collects many things and categorizes them. From the books Tate brings her she learns biology, math, how things grow and change and she is fascinated by the marsh. The author describes the marshland so well I felt myself transported there, felt the humid air, the squashing feel when I walked and encountering all of the creatures described in this book.It\u2019s incredible to think that this could happen but I really think there are those people who live in the marsh. Quoting from the book \u201cthis infamous marsh became a net, scooping up a mishmash of mutinous sailors, castaways, debtors, and fugitives dodging wars, taxes or laws that they didn\u2019t take to. The ones malaria didn\u2019t kill or the swamp didn\u2019t swallow bred into a woodsmen tribe of several races and multiple cultures. .. . . . .two hundred years later, they were joined by runaway slaves, who escaped into the marsh and were called maroons, and freed slaves, penniless and beleaguered, who dispersed into the water-land because of scant options.\"After being disappointed in her relationship with Tate she finally decides that perhaps she could be more trusting. She shares things with Chase, a boy from town who tells her he loves her, talks about a future. But everyone always leaves Kya.Then one especially happy day for Kya, she had met with the publishers of her books, two at this time, but gets an awful message from Jumpin\u2019 upon her return, Chase is dead. The sheriff is looking for Kya and there are rumors in town that perhaps Chase\u2019s death was not an accident.Oh my gosh this review is too long and there is so much more to say. I don\u2019t want to spoil any portion of this gorgeous read. There is beautiful poetry and paintings that I felt I could see. Read this book, you will be wonderfully surprised, entranced and feel great about a book again.

Over the course of her life, Kya forms certain connections particularly with two young men from town. When Chase Andrews, a young man from town, is found dead, Kya is a suspect. Did she do it? What happened? This book goes into so many different topics: class, how you can really \"help\" someone, judging someone else, what real love is, what family is, the beauty of relationships and connection. In many ways, this book is relatable. Most people have felt like an outsider at some point in their lives. In this book, Kya was very lucky to find some people who actually cared about her. Also, the author talks about this fear that Kya felt. This is normal. Women are normally afraid unfortunately. Always looking over our shoulder. Always told to not go out at night. Always travel with someone. If anything, I think this book is a good reminder that some things haven't changed in 50 years. Women are still beat by men, and even if they do go through the law, it does not always work out. This book.....Wow! It definitely deserved all of the buzz. That being said, I did NOT like the last 2 pages of the book.

Still, Owens' might be the best writer of the three, and is at her best describing the flora and fauna of the North Carolina wetlands. All three of the books are touted as debut novels (which I guess technically is true), but Owens is already an award-winning and bestselling author of non-fiction wildlife books. Let\u2019s breakdown what I like and didn\u2019t about this novel. Delia Owen\u2019s and her publisher clearly knocked it out of the part with the cover and title. But more important - Owen\u2019s writing is lush and vivid, mostly in setting, but the characters felt fully formed to me as well. The plot was rich, first with a dysfunctional family, then as a survival story, and finally as a murder whodunit. I did like how the author interspersed the beginnings of the murder mystery component in the form of flash forwards, throughout the book, increasing the conflict and intrigue earlier into the book. And while the author left me enough clues to guess the ending, it was engaging until the end. My biggest issue was that the plot was largely predictable. The plot flowing along like a meandering river, not like the twists and turns and tributaries of a dense marsh. The pacing wasn\u2019t bad, but it did get a bit choppy in the middle. I don\u2019t want to leave any spoilers, but let me just say, a few plot points weren\u2019t surprising, but they popped up, out of nowhere, making me feel like I had missed some pages. In addition to the plot, I also never became invested in the characters, maybe because I\u2019m a little burned out on this type of story line. While the swamp and the creatures and the waterways felt real enough to me, the characters themselves, while being well described and true to their motives, didn\u2019t quite pull me in.Big picture, I enjoyed reading the story, never felt bored, but it was as much of the description of the setting and the major plot questions, then it was an emotional investment.

Don't want to glaze over while a botanist explains why the green leaf turns red; I just want to savor the magic that it does, and I want to read Robert Frost aloud when it happens.So, my first 4 attempts to read Barbara Kingsolver were rough. I kept reading her books and kept feeling disappointed by, well, my reaction of really disliking them. How could I not admire a woman who would dedicate a book to \u201cwildness, where it lives?\u201d How could I not love a writer who has spent her impressive career drawing attention to the damage we are doing to our planet?I do love Ms. Kingsolver, I do. I love what she represents, love that she fights for our beautiful, natural world. That's why I've given her chance after chance. But, unfortunately, for four consecutive reads, I found her characters about as unrelatable as psychopaths in an asylum in the 1800s. But. . . even though the protagonists in Prodigal Summer are also unrelatable to me, (lady scientists who think hair brushes are tools for collecting strands of DNA). . . this is the book that FINALLY worked for me. Prodigal Summer is so stunning. It may be the greatest tribute that a novel has ever paid to a single season (two runners up may be Doctor Zhivago or Ethan Frome for winter) and it is a celebration of. . . well. . . procreation.Everybody's doing it here, people: the humans, the moths, the coyotes, the snapping turtles, the salamanders, the birds, the flies.I ruined my copy by taking it, twice, into a cold shower with me.I never knew that blue-green algae could be so. . . sexy.Physical pleasure was such a convincing illusion, and sex, the ultimate charade of safety.I'm finally on board the Barbara bandwagon.

I absolutely loved how the three \"separate\" stories wove together as the novel progressed, so that in the end it seemed everyone in the small town was tied to everyone else by the glorious web of non-solitariness among us. It's almost like a mystery story in the way that Kingsolver drops clues here and there as to how the connections will go\u2014and once you know, you find all these little nuggets you didn't even notice at first. Very fun, in that regard. A really stellar story, a love-song to Nature and to Life. (Caution to some readers: While never very graphic and always respectful, there are a few passages that are definitely sex-charged--one of Kingsolver's points is how Nature is so fueled by sex, the desire to procreate--and that humans are also part of this.) ***************************************************************Another of the summer-themed books I'm cramming to read before summer ends!

Since then, I've discovered authors like Edna Forbes and Alice Hoffman who also both have an interest in the lives of rural women, rich narratives and, sometimes magical realism.

That said, Kingsolver is still very much at the top of this field. However, this book left me somewhat disappointed by the end for two reasons:1. Big themes- without spoiling too much, the theme of this book is that evolution is always going on and that human beings are not the end product of evolution, just a part of it. Perhaps more importantly Kingsolver tries to remind us that evolution is a slow, long, adaptive process. Evolution rarely happens quickly, yet Kingsolver\u2019s characters themselves go though rapid, possibly even radical changes, by the end of this book. Good stuff for drama, but inconsistent with some of the broader themes.2. Narrative Structure- nonlinear storytelling is not accomplished solely through an unconventional conclusion (read: Hollywood happy ending/closure). Kingsolver ends her book in a kind of abstract manner, shifting perspective to some coyotes whose existence in the plot prior to the end point seemed added on. Many minor plot were left unresolved as the coyotes walked off into the Sun, This would have been fine if the rest of the plot has not been so plodding and attentive to every detail in each character's life, but it was. The conventional tale paired with an aspiring, but unresolved ending, just felt incomplete.Along the same lines, the interweaving of characters and narrative voices is great, but about 3/4 of the way through the book every main character had been connected to every other main character in a way that simply felt over the top and a bit trite. Like, we get it, it's a small community and these characters needed to have some kind of theme tying them together, but it got a bit silly by the final connection.Despite these flaws, Prodigal Summer was a good read and brought up a lot of interesting ideas and themes. The dialogue was well written and engaging..", "I think my favorite line of \"poetry\" from this book is \"He made love to me like a farmer!\" She then goes on to talk about milking cows and tilling the land while describing their love making.

This is a book that can make you love coyotes and chestnut trees and even our fellow humans (with all of our quirks and failings and missteps along the way). Here's the final paragraph (it's not a plot spoiler):\"Solitude is a human presumption. Every quiet step is thunder to beetle life underfoot, a tug of impalpable thread on the web pulling mate to mate and predator to prey, a beginning or an end. Every choice is a world made new for the chosen.\"As I expected, I am feeling reader's remorse. There are no more Kingsolver titles out there for me to read. Yet. Write quickly Barbara.

Also in showing how alike all life forms are, differing for the most part only morphologically in niche adaptation with varying subjective perspectives.An example of contradictory thinking depicted is one of the characters believing wholeheartedly in 'Creation Science,' yet trying to improve the disease resistance of a tree species through successive artificial selection \u2014 the same technique Nature employs through evolution. 'Survival of the fittest' has nothing to do with with brutishness, and everything to do with adaptability.\"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.\" ~ Mark TwainThere is more to the story to be sure, with characters fleshed out realistically, some even exhibiting a bit of comic relief, plot-line dots to be connected, and the absurdities, misunderstandings, and caring in extended family and neighbor relations. The essence of the story to me though, is our weedy species inability for the most part to recognize what sustains our being any more than our animal cousins do \u2014 the connectedness of all life.Like humans, \"A bird never doubts its place at the center of the universe.\" [from Prodigal Summer]As an example of the plot, in the first chapter the story begins in introducing the reader to not only a main character, but also to Nature in the randiness of spring as seen through the human umwelt. It's a thread exploited further as the story progresses, spiked with joy, enmity, loss, and irony. What better way to grab the reader's interest than with hormonal enticement, the subjective issues it engenders, and accompanying pleasures and resentments. In my experience, that's the cornerstone of much of literature. I'm not complaining mind you, I'm for whatever might work to hopefully instill a better understanding of the natural world that sustains us \u2014 that for the sake of our futures.What may annoy some in this writing are passages of character thoughts that those reading for entertainment only don't want to think about. Even these character thoughts aren't necessarily dispensed as gospel though, as they may be muddled, even contradicted, further on, leaving the reader to ponder the subjective good vs. bad aspects of the natural world that perplex us. Nature is oblivious to our considered rights and wrongs, adapting life forms in moving on, intent on balancing the paradoxical and symbiotic interactions among evolving life forms in preserving a continuum of physical life.\"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.\" ~ Edwin SchlossbergI thought the story even handed and the ending a nice touch. I also thought the story well crafted in knowing what to leave out.Even to those averse to the natural world being a relevant 'character' in the story though, it can be an engrossing read. Pair this book with reading other quality eco-lit, like that of Wendell Berry, Richard Powers, Edward O. Wilson, Rachel Carson, etc., and there is the potential of a heap of wisdom to be gained. It's our futures that are at stake ;-).", "My first Barbara Kingsolver book. Won't be my last. It is so BEAUTIFULLY written.

It's like Kingsolver's saying, \"We women want to be strong and wyld, but really we're just commanded by our emotions and hormones and the cycles of the moon, and we don't want to admit it. But boy, do we understand how the woods work, because we're *connnected* to it. Right, girls?\" Well, no... not me, at least. I mean, yeah, I was born and raised in the woods myself and feel a huge connectin to nature (that you'd think would be enough to allow me to enjoy the endless catalog of flora and fauna descriptions), but really, my moon cycle didn't make me succumb to men I didn't want, then randomly fly off the handle at them, or get drunk and nearly make out with nephews, or get into no-win debates with Bible thumping stubborn old men.

It isn't loaded with heavy issues (Barbara Kingsolver's \"Poisonwood Bible\" is definitely a heavier chunk o' reading compared to this) but I feel to truly appreciate \"Prodigal Summer\", one must be in the right mindset.This book takes three stories and alternates chapters with three different points of view. If you can pay attention to detail, you won't have trouble picking up on very subtle things the author leaves along the way, like bread crumbs on the trail that weaves through the three tales. However, Kingsolver is not an in-your-face author. She won't nudge you and say \"Didja catch that? Didja?\" It's up to you to find the \"clues\", so to speak.Each story/chapter has it's own title. \"Predators\" is essentially a love story, an older \"mountain woman\" and a much younger hunter meet by chance on a mountain trail. Their story isn't so much love as it is obsession. In terms of nature, their story is very detailed. I love how Kingsolver can describe a tree, a rainstorm, a snake, a bug, a cabin in the woods and each time it's different and beautiful. She doesn't feel like she flipped through a thesaurus and learned new words as she went along. Her language is very easy and flows nicely with the setting of the story. Since Deanna Wolfe is a woman who has lived on the mountain for two years observing the flora and fauna, this type of dialect would come easily to her. The second story/chapter is \"Moth Love\". Lusa Widener married a farmer, Cole, the only brother of five sisters. Lusa is Polish/Arabian and finds herself the owner of a tobacco farm at the foot of the mountains. She is not a farmer herself, but a botanist and a \"bug lady\" and struggles with relating to anyone in her new family. Her ideas about farming get her ridiculed. The third story/chapter is \"Old Chestnuts\". Garnett Walker is a man in his eighties, a retired vo-ag teacher who is grafting a new chestnut tree to withstand the blight that took out all the American chestnuts in the region. He is an extremely focused, uptight, aged man who just wants to be left alone on his farm and in his own routine, except for one thorn in his flesh, his neighbor Nannie Rawley, whose apple orchard, beehives, and gardening techniques cause him agitation and stress.I enjoyed this book even more the second time I read it. The dialect flows easily, the setting is very real, and the stories all tie up nicely by the end. I love the subtlety of this book, and still the complexity of instinct, life, death, rebirth, and finding our purpose here, among nature, to co-exist in some kind of harmony. .", "Kingsolver's artistry is supreme.

It took place in the summer and ends in autumn so it was kind of neat to start it towards the end of summer and end it as fall was beginning. If you've never read Barbara Kingsolver, her books are filled with biology lessons and are so neat to read. This book centers around three main characters leading separate lives in one Southern mountain valley. Their lives revolve around the nature that surrounds them (in some way or another) and in some way, the three are all connected to eachother. I highly recommend this book if you want a novel, a little unknown biology knowledge, and a few things to think about regarding right & wrong with the way we treat our Earth. Characters: Lusa, the young 20-something widow is left to take care of her late husband's farm and still manage dealing with all of her nosy sisters-in-law and country folks who think they know what's best for her. She ends up befriending her young niece and nephew (and eventually adopting them when her sister in law becomes ill) and teaching them all sorts of interesting facts about insects and plants and nature. Deanna, a 40- something who lives alone in a small hut on the mountain working for the forest service. She's fine living in the absence of humans and is huge friend of coyotes--in a world where every farmer is ready to hunt them all. When Eddie Bondo shows up on her mountain, they connect and have a summer long love affair. It came as no surprise to me that she was pregnant when the book ended because of their blatant physical attraction to each other. Garnett, an old 80 something man who seems to be owly and upset with the world. He's hell bent on spraying his pesticides and cannot stand his neighbor, Nannie Rowley, who let's the Beetles fly free. Through the course of the book, we see Garnett start to open up a bit--at first he's really difficult to understand with his old-man thinking. By the end, he and Nannie have formed a friendship which we thought never possible. The three are connected: Garnett's disowned son is the father of Lusa's young niece and nephew (their grandpa). Lusa and Deanna share several deep rooted beliefs about pesticides and nature although they don't know each other. Ironically, the green chair that once belonged in Lusa's in-laws stateroom now adorns the porch of Deanna's little cabin in the woods. Deanna grew up without a mother but her father's long time girlfriend was nannie Rawley, the neighbor of Garnett. .", "This is the second novel by Barbara Kingsolver that I have read, the first being The Poisonwood Bible.

The beauty of the mountain woods along the ridgelines of the Appalachians from Spring through the beginning of Fall cannot be overstated, and Ms. Kingsolver describes them well.

The venue for the story is an area I know fairly well; I worked for three years in Johnson City, TN, a stone's throw from the presumptive locale of her mythical Zebulon County. The beauty of the mountain woods along the ridgelines of the Appalachians from Spring through the beginning of Fall cannot be overstated, and Ms. Kingsolver describes them well. If you have never seen the magical carpet of wildflowers that covers the ground in Spring in the forest before the trees have fully leafed out, do yourself a favor and spend a day on the Appalachian Trail somewhere between the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and the north side of Roan Mountain during that season. The book takes as its continuous thread the return (if it is a return) of coyotes to the eastern mountains, filling the niche vacated by red and grey wolves, courtesy of humans, over 100 years ago. Kingsolver touches on the many other extinctions which have changed the Eastern forests: American Chestnut, Carolina Parakeet, Ivory-billed Woodpecker, and various other insects, songbirds, fish, and mussels. She was, after all, trained as a biologist, and her knowledge of nature and its ecological systems informs the book. For example, she explains why broad spectrum insecticides increase the number of herbivorous insects after an initial application of the poison.But she also knows the people of Appalachia, and her rendition of their speech and habits rings true to me. Lusa, the outsider, is the foil who exposes their distinctive speech and ways through her ignorance of them. Deanna Wolfe is the mountain woman who, like Kingsolver, left Kentucky to attend college and then returned to Kentucky; it is through her eyes we learn about mountain ecology and specifically about coyotes. Her relationship with Eddie is a key part of the book, and without enumerating all the moving parts, Kingsolver does a good job portraying the various shifting alliances and attractions.I enjoyed the story and the message..", "Month of August 2022: Trendy FictionsThis book could have been the perfect segue between last month\u2019s reading topic on ecology, and this month\u2019s topic, trendy fictions.

I don\u2019t read fluffy stuff between the lines and I couldn\u2019t figure out what the moth dream was about. I finally did see one small connection between two families, but it was such a brief point and nothing substantial. The story didn\u2019t really lead up to anything, just the different groups of people casually talking things out each time it was their turn. There was no climax and no ending and I had no feelings or even cared what happened to the characters.It follows three different family\u2019s lives during one prodigal summer. They each had underlying issues and needed a different kind of love, but were highly misunderstood. It was about loving and taking care of the earth, and loving and accepting each other. I will say the author is very knowledgable in regards to nature and how it behaves and functions. She mentions things I\u2019ve just learned about in the last few months. She knows so much about wild weeds and forest animals and birds. She even spoke about the ivory-billed woodpecker, now extinct, which I just learned about just a few months ago. She mentions the highly invasive Japanese honeysuckle that Lusa Widener, one of the characters, had decided, as a city girl, to let grow in-spite of her late husband\u2019s warning. It eventually had taken over the garage. So now, I\u2019m reconsidering removing the first little sprig of Japanese honeysuckle that I\u2019ve discovered this summer growing here on Hoo Hoo Acres.Lusa also talks about her favorite two silk moths: the luna and the lo moths. Now, how bizarre is this? We have lived here for 17 years. And just this past spring, I spotted my very first lo moth on my front door AND my very first luna moth on my living room window screen, both under our front porch. They stayed there, in one spot all day long until 4:15pm when, as I was watching, a bluejay swooped in under the porch and plucked the luna moth off the window. That was my very first and my very last sighting. And every time the author mentions the luna moth, she also brings up the lo moth. Strange!

Well, this was EXACTLY the sound I heard above in the rafters of the chicken coop one day. I was gathering eggs and heard it. Looked up and, lo and behold, the largest rat snake I had ever seen in my life was the length of the coop and slithering in and out around the rafters above my head. That was one my husband relocated down to the bayou. It runs in cycles, just like this novel explains. When it\u2019s a snake year, we see no mice. And when it\u2019s a mice year, that\u2019s because we don\u2019t see many snakes around for whatever reason, except her cause was for the coyotes. So, is this just a fictional story? All the parts on nature were actually very factual..", "The Circle of LifeIn this book author Barbara Kingsolver really takes the liberty within this book to assert her views on the circle of life, nature, the land, plant, animal and human life existing in conjunction to each other.

Nannie is a spry senior citizen running her own apple orchard organically. Her neighbor old Sheldon Walker always has a bone to pick with her natural methods. He at first thinks her a witch. Everyone and everything is effected by nature from beginning to end. This was a bit of a difficult read for me. I actually had to push myself and I could have put it down quite a few times but I was curious. I have enjoyed two other books by this author but this would be on the bottom of the list of her books for me. It seemed to ramble on at times about the names of flowers, trees, plants, insects, moths, wolves, goats.. You name it the research was done this species explained at length. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning as I read, even fiction but this was brimming on overkill in my opinion and I began skimming a lot. It got slightly predictable, pointless and boring. It seems the reason for the stories was to have a place to build her theories too. I don't know what I thought this was going to be like but it definitely wasn't anything I expected. I find it hard to rate this. The knowledge and research should be worth some positive points but the stories were kind of weak and I was really bored the majority of the book. 2 1/2 stars. I may try other fiction by this author considering I did like two other books of hers and this is the first fail. I do recommend anyone who has read her other books or those interested to give it a try maybe you will like it.."], "shelves": ["ashley-s-list", "favorites", "reread", "xx2012xx", "owned", "worthy-of-another-read", "book-club", "books-to-read-during-a-pandemic", "out-of-appalachia", "carolina-in-my-mind", "love-and-marriage", "kentucky-bluegrass", "summertime-and-the-living-is-easy", "all-time-favorite", "literature", "fiction", "favorites-best-books", "adultfiction", "book-club", "eco-literature", "eco-lit", "usa-setting", "fiction", "book-club", "favorites", "2015-best", "fiction", "contemporary-general", "repeatable", "2016", "to-read-again-and-again", "shaped-my-adolesence", "favorites"], "id": 69}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "The Call of the Wild", "author": "Jack London", "avg_rating": 3.89, "review_count": 390112, "url": "/book/show/3987815-the-call-of-the-wild", "description": "First published in 1903, The Call of the Wild is regarded as Jack London's masterpiece.

They try to conquer rather than living in a world of mutual respect; it\u2019s man who has lost his nature, and he imposes such a thing on everything he comes across, but the animals will fight back: \u201cWith a roar that was almost lion like in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man\u201d Buck is kidnapped (dognapped is probably more appropriate) and forced into submission by a brutal overseer. He is forced to be a sledge dog, a life of servitude he initially enjoys. The dogs enjoy the sense of purpose and quickly form their own pack. However, like trade goods, the animals are sold off to a new owner, one who is foolish and inexperienced when it comes to animal care. He pushes the dogs too far; they start to die, and he pushes the remainder even further. He cares not for the fallen, and leaves them discarded in the snow without as much as a second thought: they are nothing to him. It\u2019s this kind of attitude that is almost the death of Buck, but he comes back. For all man\u2019s wickedness, he also has the capability for good. Buck experiences human kindness for the first time, forming the deep bond that dog can have with man. He relishes in the friendship. It\u2019s the only affection he has received in a long, long, time. He doesn\u2019t want to lose it; he become possessive and violent in regards to his master\u2019s attention: he becomes a pet. He fights other dogs for the right to sit by his human\u2019s side. But such a thing is unnatural to him, and what starts to form is an internal war within his mind. He wants to find his true self again. \u201cThere is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive.\u201d Indeed, the importance of this work resides in the title. The real issue isn\u2019t a debate of ethics associated with animal treatment, but the act of being separated from one\u2019s true self. Buck\u2019s innate drive calls for only one thing, to be with his own kind. That\u2019s what human kind has deprived him of. His natural instincts are at war with the obedient behaviour that has been bred into his psyche after domestication. He wants freedom, he longs for it, and the wild calls him home.

He\u2019s between us in bed at this very moment, his head buried down in the blankets, ass up. It\u2019s my wife, then my dog's butt, then me.But socialism. After being about a dog, it's - actually the second thing is it's dark, holy shit. People are like here, kid, here's a book about a dog, kids love dogs, and ten-year-old me cracks it and it's all \"He had killed man, the noblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang. He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily.\" When they're not hunting the most dangerous game, dogs keep getting slashed open to the bone or starving piteously to death. Jack London spent some time grubbing for gold in the Yukon wilderness himself - and he was awful at it, so he knows from hardship. Jack LondonSo the third thing is that London also happened to be a socialist, and as an adult it's hard not to read Call of the Wild as an allegory. You could hardly find a better socialist allegory than a team of sled dogs, right? Everyone harnessed together, running together to pull a mighty load. They grow to love it so much that when one dog gets sick he pulls a Boxer. Buck starts the book as a pampered bourgeois and finishes it as a pack animal.Here's Blair Braverman, the face of modern dogsledding and quite a good tweeter.London also brings in a healthy dose of naturalism, the then-fashionable (now obvious) idea that the environment shapes character. And there's a great deal of somewhat confused Darwinism: London, like lots of other people, has confused evolution for memory, so Buck keeps having dreams about Neanderthals. There's some yikesy stuff about women and minorities, not definitely offensive but you get the idea that if you got him going it'd be definite eventually. (I've heard that it was indeed.)So you see why sometimes you have to remind yourself that this is a book about a dog. It's about a brave dog running in the wilderness. I remember how wild and romantic it seemed to me, when I read it as a child. Now I read it to my dog. Does it awaken, for him too, some wild and romantic memory? Does he hear the faint echoing of that primordial call? He sighs deeply, from under the covers, and farts..", "The Call of the Wild, Jack LondonThe Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London, published in 1903.

Buck, the main dog, goes back through his bloodline, down his ancestry... where he watches a primitive man, all hunched over and furry, peer out the mouth of a cave into the cold blackness of the UNKNOWN. there's some seriously badass jungian shit going on here. spooky and ineffable and just fucking gorgeous. masterpiece, baby, masterpiece. and check this passage in which Buck and the other dogs chase a rabbit through a snowy, moonlit forest: \"All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plains to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to kill - all this was Buck's, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.  There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time. he was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.\"yes. .", "He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars.THE CALL OF THE WILD ~~ Jack LondonWhen I was younger, my mother bought me a copy of The Call Of The Wild.

It was part of a series of books for boys. I wish I had read it back then. It is a marvelous book. I'm only sorry that it took me so long to get around to reading it. Jack London seems to possess an intuition of this dog's life, and, more importantly the dog's heart, an insight which must have come from intimacy and communion with sled dogs during his time in Alaska; I can't help but think that John Thornton is partially based upon London himself. Buck's story is related with a simple, direct, dramatic force which enchains interest; and which is literature at its best. The Call Of The Wild is the story of Buck, a great dog. Buck's father was a huge Saint Bernard, and Buck's mother, a huge Scotch shepherd dog; he was shaggy, big of body, strong of muscle and stout of heart. He was stolen from a California ranch and taken to live in the far glacier land of the North, where he was put in a team with work dogs and made to carry the Yukon mail. During his years as a puppy in California, Buck had lived the life of a pampered pet; he loved the hunt, swimming in the cement pond and hunting, but was ignorant of brutality, hardship and toil. Stolen and taken into the Yukon country, his character changed and he became hardened under the brutal conditions he must endure, a leader and master among dogs, turning back toward savage instincts. As time goes on Buck hearkens more and more to the call of the wild until, at last, he surrenders himself to his primitive instincts\u2014to the call of the wild within himself as he regresses to savagery in the great. London writing on Buck\u2019s spiraling to savage is achieved slowly and is written with absorbing interest. The Call Of The Wild is an absorbing tale of wild life, love, friendship and abounding in striking incidents of frontier town, camp and adventure. London explores society from a dog's perspective. However the deeper, darker messages of unbound greed, ambition and ultimately the necessity of adaptability to change are easy to spot. .", "I remembered discovering either Call of the Wild or Whitefang when I was a boy and really liking it, so on finding this on our shelves I read it to Celyn (12 but too disabled to read).I found myself translating on the hoof as the book was written in 1903 and much of the language is quite Dickensian.

I also took time to precis what had happened every few pages.The book wasn't written for children. It was first published in sections in a national newspaper and satisfied the readers' curiosity about life in the Alaskan wilds during the recent (ongoing?) gold rush. Jack London spent a lot of time out in the wilds with the men, sleds, and dogs, researching for the story, so the technical detail is accurate and serves as reportage.It's a pretty grim tale told with as little anthropomorphism as can be achieved without destroying comprehension. Our hero, the dog Buck, is stolen from a loving home to satisfy the need for sled dogs in the gold rush. We meet a whole succession of some 20+ dogs and (view spoiler)[ every single one of them dies a gruesome death  (hide spoiler)] . Some of the dogs meet very moving ends. The human cast changes swiftly and many of them fare little better.The story structure is unusual and the whole book very short (somewhere in the 30-40,000 word range). It is, however, (or perhaps because) engaging and 'educational'. I thought it was a good read, though now it's reaching for 4* whereas the boy-Mark would have given 5* without a second thought ... though perhaps he read Whitefang instead...

When we are first introduced to our husky headliner, the Buckster is Doggymesticated and living a happy, carefree existence with his kindly owner.\u00a0Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your opinion of how Buck\u2019s life turns out in the end, Buck is puppynapped by an odious offalhead with a gambling problem**.**WHOOOOAAAA there tonto!! As a life long resident of the wholesome, family-friendly City of Las Vegas, I feel the need to pause briefly and toss out some support to my hometown casinos that are currently struggling through revenue declines due to the economic slowdown and remind those of you considering a trip to Sin City that.......Oh, almost forgot. On a related note, I've also been asked by the Institute for Alcohol Awesomeness Awareness to inform you that drinking alcohol can lead to the development of super powers, so go ahead and pick up a twelve pack on the way home and who knows, you may be flying to work tomorrow\u2026........\u00a0Okay, now back on review. This is where things start to go really FUBAR for Buck. Our young hero is shipped to Alaska, where he's sold to a pair of French Canadians to be trained as a sled dog. Having a lot of spunky spirit, Buck doesn't take kindly to being stolen, starved and struck, and so goes into rather violent attack mode when finally released from his cage after the long journey. Sadly, Buck is quickly \u201cbeat down\u201d and seemingly \u201cbroken\u201d as part of his training as a sled dog. In reality (and just between you and me), Buck isn\u2019t broken at all, but learns enough \u201cself control\u201d to act the part while secretly maintaining his desire to be free. You know, like this poor fella: While held by the Frenchies from North of the border, Buck is introduced to other dogs being housed there, and quickly learns the ugly reality of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d by which the dogs live. Eventually, Buckers becomes a pack leader due to his size, strength and intelligence (remember we are talking a big Saint Bernard here):\u00a0Later, Buck is sold to a man named Charles and his family. These people are all kinds of stupid and know exatcly zippo about sledding or surviving in the Alaskan wilderness. They are simply caught up in the fever of the Klondike Gold Rush and trying to strike it rich. Initially, Buck is, sigh, resigned to follow their lead even though he senses their overabundance of incompetence is going to lead to some fugly mishap for him. However, it soon becomes apparent that the family\u2019s bungling stupidity and complete lack of understanding regarding everything from sledding, to the harsh Alaskan environment, to the fact that snow is cold, is leading everyone to a \"DANGER Will Robinson\" moment. Having no comprehension of how long or hard the journey to the Yukon will be, Charles and his family initially waste the food supply by overfeeding the dogs thinking it will make them more able to endure the long work day. Holy Moly Canolli is this a bad idea!! Anyone who owns a dog knows they will continue to eat as long as you continue to feed...even to the point of:As you might expect, the food supply soon dwindles. Charles and the other wizards begin to basically starve the dogs while expecting them to work even harder and sled longer during the day. \u00a0Uh....anyone else see trouble-a-brewing. Eventually (thank the stars), the group runs into an experienced mountain man named John Thornton. I won\u2019t give away what happens next except to say that John rescues Buck from the group and nurses him back to health. This is such sweet, tender moment in the story that I thought it deserved an equally sweet picture, thus:Buck comes to love Thornton and grows devoted to him, though he still feels a calling to be free (no marriage jokes, please....please). During his time with Thornton, Buck begins exploring the wilderness and becomes acquainted with the wolves from the area.*******MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*******MAJOR SPOILER ALERT******* MAJOR SPOILER ALERT******* MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*******...Okay, for those of you still with me, one night, Buck returns from hunting to find that Thornton has been brutally killed by a group of local Indians. As you can imagine, Buck is a wee bit upset at this and decides that maybe the Indians.............And so Buck goes absolutely BUCK WILD (yep, that's where the expression came from, how cool is that). From there, as far as the Indians are concerned, it is:  You mess with Buck's friend and you are just asking for five varieties of trouble.Afterwards, Buck comes to understand that his old life is over and follows the wolves into the wild to live as a part of the pack....*******END OF MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*******END OF MAJOR SPOILER ALERT******* END OF MAJOR SPOILER ALERT******* END OF MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*******FINAL THOUGHTS:Overall, being an animal lover, I couldn't help but love Buck and his story was interesting. There were also parts that were difficult to deal with for the same reason. I loved the final resolution of the story and the contrast between puppy Buck at the beginning of the story and the doggie Buck at the end. I didn't rate this higher because I didn't love the prose as much as the puppy and the pacing, even for such a short book, was a little uneven.

But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.\u201d In reading this book, I had my long standing belief confirmed that one cannot know how much one has loved another human being until the latter has been removed for whatever reason and that also applies to non-humans. And we are talking about a dog here:\u201cFrom his St Bernard father he had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle, save it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.\u201dBuck\u2019s cosy lifestyle was to change forever in the fall of 1897, when the lure of gold with the Klondike strike had men rushing to northern Canada to take advantage of what they perceived to be instant wealth. The one necessity to achieve this was having sled dogs and consequently Buck was taken, subjected to very rough treatment, and ended up as one of them.But Buck is no ordinary dog. He soon realizes that he has to fight for survival in his new unwanted lifestyle both with living on the meagre food rations he was given and the aggressivity of his fellow dogs. Nevertheless, this is a great dog and he soon becomes a legend in these northern lands with his prowess of pulling heavy loads and his sheer excellence as a sled dog. He even won his owners $1,600 (rather a lot of money then) when he pulled a load of 1,000 lbs a distance of 100 metres.His primordial instincts, however, gradually come to the fore and I have no doubt that when he met the first wolf and spent a day with him, that he would have reverted to type but then choice unexpectedly had come into the equation with that one word \u201clove\u201d and that came in the form of John Thornton who had saved his life. And as a result with that choice there are two roads that he can follow and so what does Buck decide to do?I don\u2019t know why this book has had such a dramatic effect on me. Perhaps the era had something to do with it, the immense lands of Canada, and Buck\u2019s continual fight for survival. How could one not admire and love this incredible dog? But imperceptibly he is changing too:\u201cThe blood longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived.\u201d And finally the following poem states it all with ancestry, instincts, and history:It is taken from \"Atavism,\" a poem by John Myers O\u2019Hara:\u201cOld longings nomadic leap,Chafing at custom\u2019s chain;Apart from its brumal sleepWakes the ferine strain\u201dAnd Buck was indeed awakened.I can never be more grateful that I came across this children\u2019s classic. Where was I in my youth that I was never told about this spellbinding book? It\u2019s not long but I actually browsed through the book again after finishing it.

Finally, I am more accepting of Buck's answer to that ending call of the wild. He must go. It is the right place for him.____________________________________________________________2016 review**Spoilers ahead**The Call of the Wild was not the first book that I remember reading as a boy, but it\u2019s the first book that I remember loving. I had a growing enthusiasm for reading. I loved dogs. These two things fit together. That was around the age of nine or ten. (A few years later, I would pick up Cujo by Stephen King. Another dog book. Not at all the same!) Anyway, the story of Buck resonated with me because he never gave up, and through London\u2019s words I felt like I caught of glimpse inside a dog\u2019s mind.There came a point near the end of the story, when Buck realizes deep loss. It is the final straw that breaks his connection to man and domesticity. His mourning still struck me with sadness. But Buck\u2019s mourning didn\u2019t last long because he felt the pull of the wild: The Call, and of course by that time, this was the only place for him. As a kid, and even now, I was pulled in two directions by this action. Every man, save one, had used or beaten Buck for their own gain and purposes. But, the leaving kind of meant saying goodbye to Buck.\u201d Again Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to obey... The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer bound him.\u201dThen versus Now: Before today, I had given The Call of the Wild 5 stars without a second thought. It was my favorite childhood book. How could I rate it less? Now I know that things change, including those childhood memories of the story that I loved. I\u2019ve read a lot of books between then and now, many of those have been very, very good. In short, that\u2019s the reason for the change in my rating. The Call of the Wild is one of those books that will remain a sentimental favorite - still very good, worth reading, and one that this boy will not forget.Side note: Found my cat studying me while listening to this audiobook. I\u2019m pretty sure that look said, \u201cWhat\u2018s this dog sh Ron?\u201d before sauntering out of the room, tail held high ......

The book ended up in my list of favourite books. I also felt somewhat disappointed with myself for not having read the tome during my schoolboy days or even my 20s. Anyway, better late than never!The lead character of the book is Buck, a large and powerful St. Bernard-Scotch Shepherd. The first chapter opens with the first quatrain of John Myers O'Hara's poem, Atavism. The stanza outlines one of the main themes of The Call of the Wild: that Buck, when removed from the peaceful Santa Clara Valley of California, where he was raised at a judge's house, will revert to his wolf heritage with its inborn instincts and characteristics. Here is O'Hara's poem \"Atavism\" in its entirety so that you can enjoy it as well as grasp its significance as to why Mr. London used its first stanza to start his book.Old longings nomadic leap,Chafing at custom's chain ; Again from its brumal sleepWakens the ferine strain.Helots of houses no more,Let us be out, be free ;Fragrance through the window and doorWafts from the woods, the sea.After the torpor of will,Morbid the inner strife,Welcome the animal thrill.Lending a zest to life.Banish the volumes revered,Sever from centuries dead ;Ceilings the lamp flicker cheeredBarter for stars instead.Temple thy dreams with the trees,Nature thy god alone ;Worship the sun and the breeze,Altars where none atone.Voices of Solitude call,Whisper of sedge and stream ; Loosen the fetters that gall,Back to the primal scheme.Feel the great throbbing terrenePulse in thy body beat, Conscious again of the greenVerdure beneath the feet.Callous to pain as the rose,Breathe with instinct's delight ; Live the existence that goesSoulless into the night.The suffering that the dog goes through in the first few chapters is bound to make you cringe. Sometimes you truly wonder how Homo sapiens can be so heartless. But then again all kinds of people make this world.London spent almost a year in the Yukon collecting material for the book. The story was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903 in four parts before being published a month later in book form. The tome\u2019s great success immediately made London rich and popular. More than that it had his name included in the canon of world-famous American writers. Authors like Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner were influenced by his writing.The Call of the Wild (cover of the Saturday Evening Post shown) is about the survival of the fittest.If you have not read the book, make sure to do so in 2017. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. It has thrills, chills and spills. Thrills as in thrilling chases; chills as in chilling icy weather and spills as in dog fights to the death with spilling blood. A few nights back I was able to watch the 1972 version of \"The Call of the Wild\" directed by Ken Annakin and starring Charlton Heston, Mich\u00e8le Mercier, Raimund Harmstorf, George Eastman and Maria Rohm. It is a co-production between the UK, France, Italy, Spain and West Germany, which is why it has a multi-star cast with actors from all these countries. It was made in Finland which is exactly why the film has a breathtaking winter landscape. John Cabrera has done a magnificent job of the cinematography.Even though the director has skipped some of the initial parts of the book and has made some changes probably because of avoiding not to make the film too long, he has still done a pretty good job by making quite an exciting film.The DVD cover of \"The Call of the Wild\".

It's a novella, technically, but like the novel that he's now known for the most, this also tells of the wild north, of snow and ice and of a hard life.We meet Buck, a dog living in the United States with a family that is fairly well off. The gardener has a gambling problem so he leads Buck away and has him kidnapped to be sold. Ever since the Gold Rush started, strong dogs are in ever increasing demand and Buck (being half Collie and half Saint Bernard) is definitely strong.Thus, Buck ends up in Canada, going through the hands of several owners. Despite his strength, he has a lot to learn since this is quite a different life from what he's used to.He's delivering mail, gets beaten, survives attacks, stages coups, almost gets killed and even finds love.While many of Buck's experiences throughout the story are based on some of the philosophies with which the author was grappling while writing The Call of the Wild, Buck himself was based on a real dog. When London first arrived in Alaska in 1897, he became the tenant of two brothers, Marshall and Louis Whitford Bond. Their dog made an immediate impression on London, for they shared the name Jack (I can say with absolute certainty that the dog would have made a lasting impression on me for a totally different reason).(Here is Jack the human with Jack the dog.)The dog was a St. Bernard-Collie mix, as Buck would be in London's novella. In a letter London wrote to Marshall Bond in 1903, he explicitly states, \u201cYes, Buck was based on your dog.\u201dWhat got to me while listening to none other than Pablo Schreiber narrating this story, was the intense descriptions of the magnificent landscape most of this story takes place in (the cold, the wind, the snow, the danger come spring, the hunger and physical pain), of the human stupidity, of the stark contrast between the environment Buck grew up in and the one he later grew to actually love, of the hard work these people and dogs had to perform, of the life in the wild and how not everyone is cut out for it (and what happens if you don't heed advice). It's clear that London knew what he was talking about, having seen and experienced most of what he was writing about for himself and it makes all the difference.An enchanting story full of harshness but also unexpected tenderness. Just like the wild it depicts..", "Novels narrated from a dog\u2019s point of view are rarities. I distinctly remember reading two, Fluke by the late great James Herbert, and Cujo by Stephen King (only partly from the dog\u2019s POV). If the author\u2019s talent is up to the task, it is quite a nice change in perspective (though I am sure you wouldn't want to read fiction from a canine perspective all the time unless you are a dog, even actual dogs don't want to do that, I have asked a few).Set in the Yukon during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, Novels narrated from a dog\u2019s point of view are rarities.

The protagonist is Buck, a huge St. Bernard-Scotch Collie. At the beginning of the book he is living a happy life as a pet of a judge but is soon stolen by the judge\u2019s gardener and sold to dog traders, one of whom beat the stuffing out of him to teach him his place in the world (as the trader sees it). After this traumatic and transformative experience he is soon sold off to Canadian mail dispatchers. The story of his life as a sled dog is quite harrowing, featuring a fight for supremacy among his teammates, being sold off again to inhumane ignoramus and almost starving to death. Buck goes through the wringer and survives admirably thanks to his tenacity, cunning, fortitude and general badassery. The title of the book The Call of the Wild only becomes a theme toward the end of the book, but I won\u2019t spoil the book by elaborating on this.The book is generally very well written though but there is very little dialog, as the dogs are not Disneyfied / anthromorphosised talking animals. The hardship and abuse endured by the sled dogs is quite harrowing. If you think you\u2019ve got it bad try being a sled dog (though if you are reading this the contingency is an unlikely one). The author Jack London clearly has a lot of affinity for dogs and feels a moral outrage at the abusive treatment they often receive from human beings. He also has an insight into dogs\u2019 mentality as this passage demonstrates: \u201cBut the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller's riding-whip; but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.\u201d\u201cIn short, the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them.\u201d Ah! I wish my dog was so eloquent! The process of \u201cdecivilization\u201d of Buck is a fascinating one, in order to survive he has to turn feral and it later transpires that Buck has some kind of primordial instinct for turning wild. That said he also has an almost conflicting desire to be loved by a human master, and for doing the best job he can as a sled dog, and later as a bodyguard and companion. What he also has above all other characters in this book is an indomitable will to live, and eventually to be free.If you love dogs this is a novel not to be missed. It is quite short, only about 170 pages, and there is an excellent free audiobook version from Librivox, very well read by Mark F. Smith (thank you sir!).Art by nikogeyer.", "The Call of the Wild is the classic dog novella, the book to check out if you want to know how dogs were portrayed in classic literature.

He was certainly a good author, as it is almost impossible to think of any other author who might have been able to paint such a dark, realistic and captivating picture of the Alaskan landscape, of nature's rudeness and the frameworks of the laws of nature.This is the story of Buck, a dog who has suffered through almost everything a dog could have to suffer through in his life. He is a dog born to luxury and kidnapped into wilderness, who has to learn to adapt himself to the rules of nature in order to survive, who has to realize that Charles Darwin's quote from Origin of Species is not merely a quote: \"In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best to their environment.\"The point of this novel completely forgot to make its presence felt to me, however. Maybe London wrote about how you have to accept the rules of nature, maybe he wrote about the strong connections between human beings and dogs, maybe he wrote about the cruelty of humans, maybe even about the cruelty of nature - all those are motifs certainly recognizable in this novel. To me, they appeared as if they were randomly interspersed into the book just for the sake of being included. However, that doesn't mean this book doesn't earn its classic status. It is a good book after all, I just didn't care about it as much as I did about White Fang.In my opinion, White Fang is way more intriguing than this novel, yet for some reason, The Call of the Wild is the more popular and beloved one, so I recommend reading this first and White Fang afterwards as it seems like I was let down by my high expectations after having read and loved White Fang years ago..", "sleep seems like an incredibly stimulating activity compared to reading this book", "Time for a reread?

I don\u2019t think I was quite old enough or mature enough (that\u2019s me, not all 10 year olds necessarily) to grasp the concepts and appreciate the progress of it\u2019s main character. This is not a happy, feel good sort of story about a dog that is treated well. London takes on some hefty themes for such a short novel. He takes on the ideas of kill or be killed, civilized vs uncivilized (in the natural world and the world of humans and beasts), suffering and persevering, pride and defeat as well as violence.Buck, a part St. Bernard and shepherd mix and a comfortable king of his California domain, is suddenly stolen from his old cushy life and sold into a new world to the Arctic as a sled dog. In the Klondike where the frenzy of the gold rush is alive, Buck very quickly realizes that he must adapt in order to survive in the harsh, snowy conditions and in the new climate of cruelty and starvation. He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.Buck\u2019s journey north and throughout the Arctic is adventurous yet so very cruel. He begins a transformation of not just his muscles but of his mind. Rather than a change towards civility, he is un-civilized, in a sense, and taken to a place within himself that was always there, that primordial or primitive state he\u2019d never experienced until now. His wild, instinctual nature is necessary in this new environment in order for him to survive. London shows Buck\u2019s progression slowly but skillfully through his precise prose even though it\u2019s very difficult to read at times. And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive again.There are some very violent and harsh scenes regarding the treatment of the animals. For the most part, the human and dog relationship is controlled starkly by the humans. Finally, we see a reciprocal loving and respectful relationship between man and beast when John Thornton bonds with Buck. But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse. This last third of the book is the most rewarding yet sad but worth the trip to get to the place that Buck has been heading all along. The call was sounding in Buck\u2019s ears and soul and he wanted to heed it in order to finally be the dog he always was deep within. His cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence, shepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild..", "This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers.

The onlookers laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow.\"buck's first theft...\"This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland enviroment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death. It marked further decay or going to pieces of his moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of love and fellowship, to respect the private property and personal feeling; but in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, who so took such things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper.\"just before buck's first kill...\"All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to kill - all this way Buck's, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.\"after winning a bet for his best bud john thornton...\"'Gad, sir! Gad sir!' spluttered the Skookum Beach king. 'I'll give a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir - twelve hundred, sir.' Thornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks. 'Sir,' he said to the Skookum Beach king, 'no sir. You can go to hell, sir.

In Project Hail Mary, Ryland Grace wakes up from a coma with a bunch of tubes sticking out of him (including that spot where the sun don\u2019t shine) and realizes that he has no memory of what happened \u2014 and eventually, through a bit of complicated science, realizes and remembers that he\u2019s the sole survivor of a mission that\u2019s the last ditch chance to save Earth from a star-eating microbe (\u201cEvolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for a few billion years.\u201d). For life that needs the output of the Sun it\u2019s not good news. And yes, he also will need to science the shit out of it.\u201cHow did you do it? What killed it?\u201d\u201cI penetrated the outer cell membrane with a nanosyringe.\u201d\u201cYou poked it with a stick?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d I said. \u201cWell. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick.\u201dIt\u2019s obvious how wonderfully nerdy Andy Weir is. It\u2019s obvious how happy random science stuff makes him \u2014 and that enthusiasm is infectious (not Astrophage-infectious but pretty darn close). As he says in this interview,\u201cMy favorite part of writing is the research, and the math, and the figuring all that stuff out.\u201d \u201cThe largest nuclear reactor on Earth makes about eight gigawatts. It would take that reactor two million years to create that much energy.\u201d  How can you not love a book that shows such resourcefulness and competence in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds? Done with overexcited enthusiasm in the most endearing way, full of sarcastic self-deprecation and humor as coping mechanism, and teaching us science the same way as a very good junior high science teacher may explain concepts to a group of overexcitable preteens. And you betcha that Weir shows his work, and even those not well-versed in science should be able to get it as he really makes it very accessible and non-daunting.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not creepy at all. Being in a spaceship twelve light-years from home and having someone knock on the door is totally normal.\u201dLuckily, unlike Mark Watney, Ryland Grace is not quite alone. Yes, discovering the desiccated bodies of his crewmates makes him think that \u201cI\u2019m going to die out here. And I\u2019m going to die alone\u201d \u2014 but (view spoiler)[this is also a first contact story.

Instead we have smart science and solid reasoning and friendly collaboration that are at the forefront and serve to even out the seemingly insurmountable odds. There is a problem that needs to be solved \u2014 and so we are going to solve it, and it\u2019s so much fun. Andy Weir is back in full force, and I\u2019m ridiculously happy about that.\u201cWhat I\u2019m really looking for is something like \u201cInformation\u201d or \u201cHere to save humanity?

Because when we put our minds to it we can cooperate and collaborate and do wonderful things.\u201cBut there\u2019s no reason aliens would follow the righty-tighty-lefty-loosey rule, is there?\u201dOh, and I think I highlighted about half of this book, and I\u2019m running out of the ways to include quotes in my review, so yeah.

By the way, I spend a third of my time doing this. And if I can\u2019t do it for a while, I go insane and eventually die.

I know my overcooked brain cells don\u2019t have enough capacity to absorb every complicated, detailed, elaborated scientific facts and fantastic world building which amazed me at least thousand times but I fell so hard what I could understand which is enough for me to enjoy this book! It truly hugged my inner weirdness and nerdy proportionally! Since the Martian I was expecting something equally blistering, earth shattering, marvelous from this author! After the disappointment feelings I got from Artemis, I am truly satisfied with my space journey, intriguing mystery and another one man against the universe to save lives theme!  Ryland Grace wakes up from miles away from his home, lying down on a soft bed, surrounded by cameras watching his every move, wearing breathing mask tight on his face, naked, connected to more tubes he may count! And this is not the only weird thing about his situation: he is accompanied by two corpses and as a computer keeps asking what is two plus two.  Did I also mention he didn\u2019t remember anything about himself including his name! And as we discover more about him by catching glimpses from his past, we realize this man is only hope to save the universe and he\u2019s the sole survivor of desperate deep space mission ( you may call it suicide mission) Through the scattered quick flashbacks, we gather more information how he was assigned for this project ! I don\u2019t want to spill more about details which I always do : because the surprise elements and unexpected twists are important to enjoy this journey!  Even though this looks like a long journey, narrated by one man who barely gathers his memories and rediscovers his identity ( so ironic, right, a world\u2019s future depends on a man who tries to redefine who he\u2019s and how he finds his real mission to exist), this book is truly a precious, addictive gem! It is smart, complex, entertaining but in the meantime thrilling, claustrophobic: the dark parts equally balanced the witty, enjoyable parts.  And let me tell you something, I loved to spend my time in Ryland\u2019s mind. He was such a great narrator who has dark and witty sense of humor. You easily engage with him and deeply feel his dilemmas, struggles! Overall: maybe it\u2019s too early to declare but I feel like this will be my best sci-fi reading of this year!I\u2019m so thankful to Mimi Chan and fantastic Goodreads team to share this remarkable, one of the best reads of the year with me! I highly recommend this extra smart, compelling, entertaining, well crafted novel! I\u2019m planning to reread again in near future!

Unfortunately, neither of them survived the journey, so he is all alone. And he is Earth's last hope for survival.One thing that completely amazed me was how believable and plausible the science is in here. There's nothing worse than reading a science fiction book and realizing that the science part is all sham. Not here, folks. Not only is the premise intriguing and ingenious, but the whole thing actually makes sense. And it's easy to grasp and digest, divided into small bits that any layman can understand.For me, science fiction falls into two categories: the Twilight Zone kind where kooky things are going on and explanations are a bit handwavy; or things are happening based on real science and there are actual explanations for everything. And this book falls solidly in the second, which is my favorite kind. Science aside, this story is so much more. It is about hope and finding connections in the most unexpected of places. It's overcoming fear and adversity. It's digging deep within yourself, rising to the challenge, and becoming all that you are capable of.I'm not sure how Andy Weir came up with the idea for this book, though I can't help but wonder at its sheer audacity. It was compelling from the first page, and it just got better and better. It was utterly unputdownable.When I'm reading a book, I'm always looking for that special rare experience where the book touches me and I walk away irrevocably changed. This book made me laugh, think, hope, and marvel. It doesn't get any better than this.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Martian~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

His latest novel is a wild tale about a high school science teacher who wakes up in a different star system with no memory of how he got there. The rest of the story is all about how he uses science and engineering to save the day. It\u2019s a fun read, and I finished the whole thing in one weekend.", "I think my job is to solve the Petrova problem.\t\t\t \u2026in a small lab, wearing a bedsheet toga, with no idea who I am, and no help other than a mindless computer and two mummified roommates.Guess I was wrong to resist reading this for months.

Thing is, I liked The Martian and really really disliked Artemis. In fact, Weir's second novel bored and annoyed me so much that I was set against ever reading his future books. But after seeing positive review after positive review and having friends tell me to read this, I finally did. And Project Hail Mary was so much fun. And science-y. And a bit sad. But mostly fun.It's a different sort of story, but Project Hail Mary contains a lot of the stuff that made The Martian good. The stakes in the novel feel immense, the chance of coming up with a plan and getting out of the central predicament seems tiny, and all of this science drama is juxtaposed with the narrative voice-- basically, a funny, can't-help-but-love-him nerd who manages to put his brain to work in the direst of circumstances.We begin with Ryland Grace waking up on a spaceship with no idea who he is and how he got there. Exploring his surroundings, he quickly discovers that his crew mates are dead and he is humanity's last hope for survival. I won't reveal his mission because I think learning about it through flashbacks is part of the fun, and the more we learn the more impossible his mission seems.I'll leave it at that. The book alternates between the past in the run up to the mission as we discover the huge problem humanity faces, and the present in which Ryland Grace attempts to save our planet. The world of the novel gets bigger and wilder and I have to say I very much enjoyed the adventure and mystery.It's not five stars for me because I felt it ran on a little long in the middle with the characters having one nerdgasm after another (which seems to be a thing with Weir) and I also saw the \"twist\" coming, if you can call it that (view spoiler)[the one about what Stratt did (hide spoiler)].

But I never had such a contrasting opinion about two books like this book and Artemis. I liked the book The Martian by Andy Weir. So I was sure that I was going to love both these books. But I was totally mistaken and was off to a roller coaster ride with these books. Andy Weir perfectly showed us what exactly failing forward means. Artemis was an utter disaster and one of the worst books I have read this year. II have read two books by the same author simultaneously a few times in my life. But I never had such a contrasting opinion about two books like this book and Artemis. I liked the book The Martian by Andy Weir. So I was sure that I was going to love both these books. But I was totally mistaken and was off to a roller coaster ride with these books. Andy Weir perfectly showed us what exactly failing forward means. Artemis was an utter disaster and one of the worst books I have read this year. It was released in 2017. The author learned from all the harsh criticisms the book received and came up with a stunner one week ago called Project Hail Mary. This is an absolute gem of a book. This book teaches us many vital concepts. The whole of Earth's future is lying in the hands of the protagonist, Roland Grace. To make things even worse, he doesn't even know who he is when he wakes up one day in his ship with the rest of the crew dead. You might be thinking this might be something like Robert Ludlam's Jason Bourne meets Christopher Nolan's, Joseph Cooper. Initially, we might feel like that, but we will understand that it is entirely different, having so many different layers when we dive deep into this novel. We will land up in some realms that no other author has explored, and we will be deeply immersed in it that we will lose track of time and sleep like the protagonist. We will need someone like Rocky in this novel to remind us that we are human beings and we need to sleep to function properly. There are twists and turns galore, but there is no mind-bending twist like we see in Blake Crouch's books. This book makes us emotional, but nothing will break our hearts or drastically change our life. We can't also see philosophical musings like in Ursula K. Le Guinea's books. But still, this novel is unique, and we can see the brilliance seen only in the novels written by Isaac Asimov and Arthur C.Clarke.What I learned from this book 1) Science behind Project Hail Mary There are many complex empirical scientific theories discussed in this book, but most of them can be understood by an ordinary person, and only a few will go over your head if you love to read science fiction. We can see that the author had done fastidious work for writing this novel. Almost all branches of Science are discussed vividly in this book. Roland Grace might have been a disgraced molecular biologist, but he is well versed in nearly all branches of science. We can see him discussing Formal science (mathematics, statistics, and computer science), Natural science (physics and various subdivisions of it, chemistry, biology, astronomy, medicine (particularly biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology and pathology), engineering), and even Social science (sociology, psychology, and economics). Grace is trying to solve an elusive problem without even knowing who he actually is, which makes his journey even more complicated. I want to discuss a lot more about the scientific ideas addressed in this novel. But if I say one more word, it might become a spoiler and ruin your reading experience of this fantastic novel. So I m leaving it to you to explore and enjoy your own way.  \"I penetrated the outer cell membrane with a nanosyringe.\"\"You poked it with a stick?\"\"No!\" I said. \"Well. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m a scientist! Now we\u2019re getting somewhere! Time for me to use science. All right, genius brain: come up with something! \u2026I\u2019m hungry. \u201d  2) Empathy This book might be coming under the genre of science fiction, and it truly lives up to its expectations, but if someone asks me what the thing I loved the most in this book is, my answer will be the empathy shown by the characters towards others. Unlike the author's earlier books, where the protagonists were impetuous, arrogant, and toxic to a certain extent, the characters in this book are entirely different. The friendship between Rocky and Roland Grace will touch our hearts.  \u201cWell, you\u2019re not alone anymore, buddy,\u201d I say. \u201cNeither of us are.\u201d   \"Another similarity you and me both willing to die for our people. Why? Evolution hates death.\"\"It's good for the species, I said. \"Self -sacrifice instincts makes the species as a whole more likely to continue.\"  3) An interesting way to look at evolution Andy Weir interestingly uniquely discusses about evolution in this novel. Some people will find it hard to digest when he says that evolution is lazy. But it is true that we can also view it from such an angle \"Intelligence evolves to gives us an advantage over the other animals on our planet. But evolution is lazy. Once a problem is solved, the trait stops evolving.\"   4) FriendshipWe will see one of the unique friendships we have seen in recent times in this novel. It will take some time for us to understand the chemistry between Grace and Rocky. The bond between them becomes so strong that they are ready to sacrifice their lives to save the other person. They use very few sentences between them during the conversation, especially in the initial part. Still, we can see honesty, humor, love, generosity, trust, care for each other, encouragement, supportiveness, and dependability between them. They develop some telepathic connection between them and can predict the other person's behavior and act according to that. Among all the books I have read and movies I have seen, I was able to see a similar chemistry only in the film made together by Steven Spielberg and Melissa Mathison. \u201cI've gone from \"sole-surviving space explorer\" to \"guy with a wacky new roommate.\" It'll be interesting to see how this plays out\u201d  5) Ice age We have seen many books, cartoons, and movies dealing with the topic of the ice age. This book is also dealing with the same concept. Even though we will feel it a little hard to believe, I think this is one of the very few books that tried to explain the reason behind the ice age in the best possible way. \u201cThat would mean ice age, like right away an instant ice age.\u201d  6) Astrophage and Tau Ceti These are the two new names you will hear the most while reading this novel. The way the author describes about it is simply brilliant.  \u201cAstrophage, the word alone makes my muscles clinge up, a chilling terror that hits like a lead weight.\u201d  7) World building This book will teach us how to do proper world-building. Everything in this plot is explained to the minute level with appropriate scientific data. The way the protagonist describes the Astrophage life cycle is simply brilliant. This is one of the best world-building I have seen in a novel. \u201cA teeny tiny thrust on a teeny tiny mass can be an effective mode of propulsion\u201d  My favourite three lines from this book  \u201cHuman beings have a remarkable ability to accept the abnormal and make it normal.\u201d  \u201cMy subconscious mind has priorities and it is definitely telling me about this.\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s a weird feeling, scientific breakthroughs.\u201d   What could have been better?The complicated scientific information in the initial parts might be boring for some readers who don't love to read science fiction. But the best part of this novel is that we can enjoy this novel even if we don't fully understand the scientific facts discussed in it if we show the patience to continue reading after the initial part where we are bombarded with a plethora of scientific information. There are some areas in this novel where you will feel slightly similar to the author's earlier book, The Martian.Rating  5/5 This is certainly a masterpiece that everyone should read. If someone like Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Robert Zemeckis or Christopher Nolan decides to make the movie of this novel, I am sure that it will give us a transcending cinematic experience and win many accolades and Oscars. Even though I am envious of my friends who were able to read this book way before it was published, I am still feeling blessed as I was able to read it just after it was published. .", "When Ryland Grace awakens from a coma, he discovers he is on a spaceship.

It\u2019s an incredible thing, especially because I\u2019ve watched the movie adaptation first, and I knew how the story will go already. And still, I was impressed, entertained, and felt satisfied from reading the novel. I know that Artemis has been mixed received; I haven\u2019t read it yet, so I can\u2019t say much on this novel. However, if you\u2019re a fan of The Martian, I really don\u2019t see how you\u2019ll end up disliking this one. \u201cSometimes, the stuff we all hate ends up being the only way to do things.\u201d If you haven\u2019t heard of the premise of Project Hail Mary, I\u2019m going to sum it up briefly now. Ryland Grace is a lone astronaut with a task to save Earth from disaster, but he\u2019s alone, and he has no memories of what has happened before. He has to find a way to save Earth from disaster, and then come back home, all by himself. See? It\u2019s practically the premise of The Martian with a new addition of saving the world. I won\u2019t lie, there were times where the plot and the structure of the storyline felt too similar; I enjoyed it, but an extra distinction would\u2019ve earned this book a better remembrance strength in my head. That being said, this isn\u2019t a carbon copy of The Martian; Weir still managed to make Project Hail Mary a different book besides the incredibly similar premise and storytelling structure.\u201cI feel like Sherlock Holmes. All I saw was \u201cnothing,\u201d and I draw a bunch of conclusions! Conclusions that are wildly speculative and with nothing to prove them, but conclusions!\u201d Ryland Grace, as a character, felt pretty much like a non-foul-mouthed Mark Watney. Other than that, the voice of his narrative felt highly similar to Mark Watney; whether this is a good thing or not, it\u2019s up to each reader to interpret. Personally, despite the similarity to Mark Watney, this was a good thing for me because I was indeed in a mood for reading a POV of a character that can act positively despite their harsh circumstances; I got what I wanted here. I did, however, found that the scientific details were too much. \u201cHuman suffering is often an abstract concept to kids. But animal suffering is something else entirely.\u201d I\u2019m not claiming that I understood every scientific detail in The Martian, but in my opinion, Weir did a superb job in balancing the science info-dump in The Martian along with the characterization, plotting, and humor. The Martian never stopped feeling super intriguing and captivating to me. That\u2019s not the case in Project Hail Mary, not at first, anyway. The heavy discussions on mathematics and physics were simply over my head, and there were so many of them in the first half of the novel that it felt to me like I was transported back to high school to fail these two lessons again. Fortunately, the second half remedied the pacing; the balance between plot, characters, dialogues, and scientific info-dumps was handled significantly better. And similar to The Martian, the ending of Project Hail Mary was enormously satisfying.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just the childish optimist in me, but humanity can be pretty impressive when we put our minds to it.\u201d Filled with positivity, intellect, and thrill, to me Project Hail Mary was almost as good as The Martian. I will admit that my expectations towards this novel may be a bit too high, and I\u2019m sure many readers who enjoy\u2014plus understand\u2014the intricate scientific details will have a more enjoyable reading experience. What\u2019s the highlight of Project Hail Mary? Rocky. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on this.Official release date: 4th May 2021You can pre-order the book from: Amazon UK | Amazon US | Book Depository (Free shipping) | Bookshop (Support Local Bookstores!)

(view spoiler)[ Alien friends  (hide spoiler)]are the best I can\u00b4t remember many similar, perfect matches from somewhere else in sci-fi, maybe because not many authors ever considered risking balancing the plot on such an (view spoiler)[ interspecies  (hide spoiler)]relationship. Weirs\u00b4gags unfold thanks to good, old cultural differences, innuendos, social criticism, and contrasts, letting the reader permanently question what cool idea might come next and how Weir continues the sci-fi tradition of ironizing the heck out of the dysfunctional human society.  Should one freeze or should one sweat, science isn\u00b4t clear on that.Global cooling or warming, glaciers or tropical greenhouse fun, it\u00b4s tricky to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea. Another of Weirs\u00b4ingenuities is to draw a completely different picture of our current climate crisis, by just reversing it to something some might hope for, at least for the time until all the damage we\u00b4ve done to earth\u00b4 weather, soil, ecological, etc systems can be fixed thanks to better tech. For instance with Dysonswarms of billions of small, automated, collective super AI automated, coordinated drones that block sunlight in the space around earth or do some work in the atmosphere like adding or removing the right chemicals from air and water, greening deserts, building superstructures, etc. Until then and tech saves us, each book awakening more public awareness regarding the mixture of the sixth extinction, Venus style super global heating catastrophes, not ever to mention all the wars and humanitarian crises this will cause, is important.  The irony is that we already have many of the technologies that could reduce the speed of self cannibalization, but prefer to put billions and trillions of fiat money in economic systems destroying and worsening the situation, although a simple shift of all the subsidies and central bank made fantasy money, not even physical anymore, just numbers, to use it to green everything in a sustainable way, could be made overnight. Economics is a fringe voodoo scam, one can do everything good or bad with it by just changing the dogmas and boring, badly written holy texts of macro economical yada yada yada. But that all goes too far, back to the show. People happier with the Martian and Project Hail Mary than ArtemisDuh, Project Hail Mary, and The Martian are different styles, one could say different subgenres, full of humor and totally character and tech survival focused, while Artemis is more of a normal sci-fi novel with its conventions. People shouldn\u00b4t expect the always same writing style of evolving, new authors and consider that it might just subjectively not be their kind of subgenre of a genre new to them, but still a good book. It\u00b4s true, Martian and Mary are better, but that doesn\u00b4t make Artemis a bad book, it\u00b4s just not as accessible for not sci-fi heads. Less is moreLike in many great works, Weir just uses humor, science, some tropes, characterization, social criticism, and innuendos to compress such immense space freighter loads of philosophy, ideas, creative thought experiments, and charm in this short work that one would like to know how long it originally (not just the kind of space opera ( would it have been a megahit or kind of flopped like Artemis instead? We\u00b4ll never know) he stopped writing and used elements of it in this one) was before he began finetuning and cutting it to perfection. Or did he first plot everything and didn\u00b4t creatively free write too much, I don\u00b4t even know what kind of writer he is, what a shame, I should be infected with Astrophages, proto molecules, T Virus, melding plague, etc. at the same time as an appropriate punishment. Switching between nerdgasm, tragicomedy, and DIY tutorialsThereby, Weir can be educational, funny, hopeless, and change tone and impact in perfect balance, to always keep all kinds of readers interested. In other cases, social sci-fi gets too sentimental without technobabble, which is itself too static and cold while nobody laughs, but here, all kinds of audiences get some individualized world saving plot possibilities served as stylish as possible.  AstrophagingDid anyone notice that viruses aren\u00b4t just bad in real life, but great for all kinds of sci-fi, video games, and series? Especially if a unique, new combination of theoretical physics, science fantasy, real biochemistry, clarketech, and some billions of years of evolution are thrown into the mix, close to everything can come out and be used as unique, new, never before seen, or thought of plot device. What an incredible microorganism, even able to teach some hard STEM science just by its existence. Friendship and relationshipsEspecially in contrast to the hard science focus, it\u00b4s astonishing that Weir shines where many sci-fi writers struggle. Creating living, credible characters with everyday problems while making the science accessible, funny, and more infotainment than soporific. Readers prone to both sides of the empathy scale can get so much out of this, because it offers the different perspectives of both cold, hard knowledge and emotional, soft vertebrate behavior. Combine this with the accessibility to make it easy to love for everyone new to the genre and space science and what comes out is one of the possibly best and masterfully executed new ideas in modern sci-fi.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph....", "Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir\u00a0Project Hail Mary gives us the story in several timelines.

Life is dying, life will be completely wiped out unless energy consuming aliens can be eliminated. But why is a science teacher, whose students are 12-13 years old, on a spacecraft? Slowly, we learn everything and by the time Grace remembers it all, there is nothing to do but proceed with a mission that has fallen apart in many ways.\u00a0Beware science and math! But no need to give it much thought if you are like me and are happy to let the character(s) take care of those pesky details. What I enjoyed so much about this story is something else but I don't want to spoil that something else.

Mark Watney's alone in the space, again. Oh. Can you believe his luck? Anyway, he's alone and he's quirky and nerdy and that's all very nicely boring but hold on.. there are flashback scenes. We get to meet other people. A diverse group of scientists from many countries to save the world. YAY.No, I take that back. No YAY. This is no diverse group of scientists. This is a collection of bad, outdated racial and character stereotypes stolen from bad Hollywood movies from white directors. Sure, the Russian drinks vodka. Asians speak with horrible accents. (I was ready to punch the narrator at that point.) Kids are all polite and interested in lessons and all laugh at the teacher's jokes. (This Mark Watney Pro Max is a schoolteacher and Andy Weir's never been in a classroom) The bossy female boss is bossy. Scientists make sex jokes that are not funny if you're not a 14 year old virgin. (Remember that famousThe Martian boobs emoticon? I just love Andy Weir's characters.) And of course, every one lovessss our hero. There's even a line in the book along the lines of  'everyone likes you better'  . Yes, really. It just grates on my nerves. It's obvious the author does not have much experiences with human relationships but instead of using that and giving his characters more life and making them awkward and human, he has to have them become HEROes: perfect little Gary Stus who are smart and nerdy social butterflies, and most popular guys in the multiverse.Wait, there's an alien. Oh my god, finally something interesting.......annd it's not. Rocky, the alien's character, had to be offensive to aliens if aliens read badly-written sci-fi books. He waves and thumbs up and mimics our hero because 1, that's logical we all mimic when we see another species make weird signs with their appendages and 2,because the alien has no culture of his own apart from what a 12 year old kid thinks how aliens eat, sleep and shit.Once they got talking, (yes they talked. I'll get to that later.), we finally learn Rocky's personality. It must be quite different from humans, coming from a different universe and all but wait a minute. He's nerdy and quirky and is talking like a certain human we know. *Gasps He's Mark Watney with eight legs. By now, we've already got a Mark Watney in the spacecraft Hail Mary. There is a Russian Mark Watney on Earth with vodka. Another Mark Watney with boobs. An Asian Mark Watney. Now there's an alien Mark Watney. It's an abundance of Mark Watneys. Who said this is not sci-fi horror? Mom, pick me up. I'm scared. So let's take a look at the plot maybe that's where the five star reviews get their stars from. But... but....there is no plot. I actually liked the idea of an apocalypse causing aliens being single celled bacterium kind of organisms but that's it. Apart from this, the rest of the whole plot is a childish daydream that could be concocted by any middle grade school children who have watched star trek once.It is juvenile to the point of embarrassing. A junior school-teacher is the hero Earth sent for the first ever interstellar mission? Okay. Sounds unrealistic but okay.Then he's the first person to be allowed to experiment on the astrophage (the alien space invaders). That's it. Just him in a laboratory. For a world-ending scientific discovery.One person is coordinating the entire multinational mission. And she's exempted from any legal repercussions. She's absurd to the point of not resembling a human female. Andy Weir would have us think she's a real human woman but I bet she's a robot and Andy Weir doesn't even know it.Two of the entire 3 person-crew died leaving only our hero. (Not a spoiler. Happens at the very beginning.) That's probably because Andy Weir knows he can't handle more than the astounding number of one character. So, he killed them off. Nice.He met an alien and everything goes smoothly because Our HERO figures out the alien language in record time. Of course. And not just general phrases but really long, completed sentences. Combine that with their shared personality or lack there of, makes their conversations sound like a kid playing astronauts and aliens by himself.And this all happens in the first chapters. The rest is just massive info dumps from our hero (I'll just keep saying our hero because that's what the MC and Andy Weir wants us to think. H.E.R.O.) because he's so smart and awesome and convenient problems arising only to be solved by, you guess it, our hero because he's so good at science stuff and, you know, so smart and awesome.This whole plot is a slap to the face but the ending? It's a kick to the groin. It's like Andy Weir thinks 'Well, you've endured this whole fairy tale, might as well get this cheesy and extremely implausible ending shoved down your throat. Goodbye.' This is not a book but a wish fulfilment of a childish sci-fi fantasy Andy Weir must have thought up during one boring physics class back in middle school and it's utterly embarrassing. If I had written it, I would not have showed it to my cat, let alone a publisher. At the end, Andy Weir did not make me care about Mark Watney Pro Max nor about Earth and apocalypse or Rocky even. Everything's just over the top and ridiculous. It's like a parody. Not a real novel.I saw that it's already been bought to be made into a movie. The Martian movie was 100000 times better and if this is turned into a movie, who knows? I might enjoy it. Maybe Andy Weir is better suited at drafting movie ideas than actually writing these not-books. Because honestly, this is the second time I've tried his writing and both times, I felt like I was trapped in an elevator during blackout with someone I can\u2019t stand..", "*Spoiler Alert*You couldn't have prised this out of my hands initially.However, somewhere at the 60% region, it got bogged down by too many flash-fires while our protagonist, Ryland Grace, the ultimate Gary Sue and the purveyor of all things Space/Biology/Physics/Chemistry/Engineering/Math/Music/Language/Etc, got progressively more facetious and irritating.Like a modern-day John McClane (but in space) and with astrophage as the villain.

The 8th-grade teacher is a scientist who finds himself involved in researching this phenomenon and later he wakes up on a suicide mission to find a way to kill those astrophage and basically save Earth.Well, credits where it\u2019s due, this book required tons of research and it showed that Weir did his homework and then some more. He tried to explain everything using our laws of physics which was nice and interesting to read about.I found this book -other than the science- smooth and easy to follow, sure it started slow but I liked being in Ryland Grace\u2019s head and wasn\u2019t bored by it. The book is told following two timelines, Ryland in space and the other whole Astrophage discovery and planning to save Earth preparing for project Hail Mary. Okay, so why not 4 stars? Well, I had a \"few\" issues with this book.\u2732 It was too similar to the Martian in the concept of \u201cman alone in space doing some crazy shit\u201d although I didn\u2019t mind this while reading, I also can\u2019t not mention it\u2732 Grace\u2019s voice was also too similar to Watney\u2019s (I loved that guy) so I\u2019m not sure how to feel about that. While it made the book easier to read, I certainly had some question marks about it. Like why not come up with a new characterization? \u2732The science. Ok look, it was cool and I was very interested in it at first. Then it got technical. So much more technical. Needlessly so. I don\u2019t know about footnotes in novels but maybe the overdone details could\u2019ve been added as footnotes or something for those who\u2019d like to read more about it? An external link for those interested?\u2732 To borrow Hamad\u2019s word, the characters were comical. They sometimes had a trait and their characterization was focused on that trait, especially Russians. They are always portrayed as stern by American authors, how clich\u00e9. Let\u2019s make them the life of the party with their vodka!!!\u2732 I hope this will be edited in the final version but oh, we had so many exclamation marks. Even I know enough to realize that the fewer exclamation marks used the better and this book had soo many while they simply could\u2019ve been a period. \u2732 For such a book that is based on logic, some things certainly didn\u2019t reflect that. When Grace wakes up he has lost his memory, not technical knowledge just personal identity. So he\u2019s trying to figure out where he\u2019s from. He thinks of every way to figure that out and ohh he doesn\u2019t think metric (also he\u2019s such a cool American scientist!!! Thinks in metric too!). Can\u2019t he speak and he\u2019ll figure it out from his accent? British and American accents are pretty different for example. I\u2019m no native English speaker and I still can distinguish lots of different accents.. his solution to where he's from is pretty simple but no we had to show how smart we are. Also, why would a Canadian know the distance between NY and LA? Why would anyone non-American know?Another stupid thing was that he\u2019s touching an alien object, he doesn\u2019t wear gloves no. He ends up burning his hands but I found it pretty stupid to touch an alien object without gloves and without making sure that its surface is not poisonous or harmful to human skin\u2026\u2732 Stratt who is basically leading the whole project of saving Earth hasn\u2019t studied ANYTHING to do with science and has people to tell her if this is the right choice or not scientifically.. she was dismissing the very helpful idea of someone if that person didn\u2019t repeatedly demand her attention. \u2732 The thing that I found hard to believe is how someone with a doctoral degree is teaching science to 8 grade. I would\u2019ve been fine (but not really) if Grace had been a high school teacher. But middle grade with such a vast knowledge? Oh please. He also apparently has more knowledge than no other 37 years old has. He just knows a lot about everything scientific even if he didn\u2019t do any research in years, even if he hasn\u2019t majored in more than one scientific field, well, biology? Physics? Computer science? You name it. our guy knows about it. I preferred honestly the present, past perspectives rarely interest me and this book was no exception. Sure I want to know how he got there.. but not in such detail. I just wanted to see how he\u2019ll solve things. I understand however that this was needed in a way to make the book less Ryland heavy. I also liked the ending part. Overall this book was fun even it got carried away with the scientific details. However, that\u2019s about it, enjoyable. It lacked depth and fleshed-out characters. I would recommend it to Weir\u2019s fans but if you haven\u2019t read any of his books yet, then you should definitely start with the Martian, which I loved even if sci-fi is not my thing. I think it's gonna be liked by many people however and it'll be more successful for sure than Artemis because it's such an entertaining book! Also, it's certainly winning GR's best sci-fi for 2021.Thanks to publishers and Netgalley for sending me an e-arc of this book.", "Thirty years. I looked out at their little faces.

Andy Weir - image from his Facebook pagesThe title of the book may seem opaque to some folks outside the US. Weir is referring, of course, to a last-ditch play to win or tie American football games. It is called the Hail Mary pass. Keep enough blockers back to protect the quarterback while all available receivers head for the end zone as the quarterback lofts a pass, usually of considerable distance, in the hope that one of the receivers can haul it in through an act of divine intercession. The play is named for the prayer of course. It\u2019s caused a lot of headaches with the translators. Nobody outside the U.S. knows this phrase. Even English-speaking countries like the U.K. don't have that expression. In most of the language translations, they're changing the title. In one of them it\u2019s just called The Astronaut or something like that. - from the GR interviewIn Andy Weir\u2019s latest novel, the survival of life on planet Earth, and whatever other life might be swimming, flying, creeping, or otherwise meandering about in our solar system, is imperiled by an invasive species. (Not really a spoiler, more of an aside. (view spoiler)[OK, a pet peeve here. We have a few names for our home planet, and for the rest of the rocky and gaseous chunks floating about our particular star. So why has humanity been so singularly unable to come up with a decent name for our solar system? I mean calling our solar system \u201cthe solar system\u201d is like slapping a label on a can that says \u201cfood.\u201d (Yes, I know this was done in the movie Repo Man, but it was intended to be ironic. At least I hope it was.) I mean how generic and undescriptive can we be? There are billions of solar systems out there, and I bet there are plenty that have nifty names. So, I am gonna go for it and claim that from now on our solar system should be called the Will Byrnes Planetary System (WBPS). Recognizing that this is in no way deserved, I will happily cede it to a more reasonable name, one grounded in actual achievement or cultural significance\u2026for a cup of coffee (20 oz at least) and a couple of doughnuts (one glazed, one jelly). Until then, it\u2019s mine, all mine. (hide spoiler)] The nasty little buggers have a talent for converting energy to mass and mass to energy. Their little eyes (if they had eyes) light up in the presence of an active power source the way some of us feel compelled by the sight of pastries in a shop window. Which would make our sun a doughnut shop with a few quadrillion hungry customers beating down the door. Not a wonderful situation for the shop. A more apt, if somewhat less entertaining image, is that of a vast swarm of locusts denuding a landscape.Hoping for an act of god might be worth a shot. His ship, and the project that spawned it, are named for the prayer, even though by way of a sport. Hail Mary full of\u2026um\u2026Ryland? Well, Ryland Grace. It remains to be seen whether or not the Lord is with him, or his ship. But he is not alone, although, after finding that his crew-mates did not travel well, it seems like he would be. Luckily for Ry, Earth is not the only populated planet imperiled by this galactic pain in the neck. He encounters another, and thus begins a beautiful friendship. I won\u2019t bother with describing Rocky, other than to say that Rocky is not at all humanoid. Through engineering ingenuity and commonality of purpose the two find a way to communicate with and help each other in their mission to save their respective planets. There is a child-like quality to Rocky, as well as a very creative brain, and a universal decency, that will make you care about him/her/it/whatever. There is no one better than Weir at writing adorable. Weir, the Ted Lasso of science fiction writing, has been trying to work on his character-writing skillset. He is amazed that so many people loved The Martian, despite the fact that his hero goes through absolutely no change during his ordeal. He had given Watney his best personal characteristics, on steroids. Then had a go at a less idealistic character in his novel, Artemis, using what he saw as some of his lesser personal characteristics to inform his lead.Ryland Grace was my first attempt to make a protagonist not to be based on me. He's a unique character I'm creating from whole cloth, and so I'm not limited by my own personality or experiences. - from the GR interviewI am not sure he has succeeded. The special energy that powered astronaut Watney was a combination of superior technical skills, a wonderful, wise-ass sense of humor, a can-do attitude, and a deeply ingrained optimism. Mark Watney could have been on the Hail Mary in place of Ryland Grace and I am not sure most of us would have noticed, well, except for a couple of personal downsides. The sense of humor is pretty much the same. Ditto for the technical talent and scientific problem-solving predisposition. He may be a tick down from Watney on the optimism chart, but you will get the same satisfaction from watching Grace as you did his Martian predecessor. But while Weir\u2019s character development skills might still be\u2026um\u2026under development, his story-telling skills remain excellent. The stakes are high, global extermination, multiple global exterminations actually, and the future of life as we know it, and some life we know very little about at all, is dependent on two creatures working together to solve the biggest problem of all time. No pressure. So, a buddy story. A tale of friendship far from home. The narration alternates between two timeframes. In the contemporary one, Ry uses his special scientific-method powers plus base of knowledge to figure out the situation he is in, and come up with serial solutions to serial challenges. This is totally like The Martian, although this guy is maybe a bit less funny. I\u2019m a smartass myself, so smartass comments come naturally to me. For me, humor is like the secret weapon of exposition. If you make exposition funny, the reader will forgive any amount of it. And in science fiction\u2014especially with my self-imposed restriction that I want to be as scientifically accurate as possible\u2014you end up spending a lot of time doing exposition. - from the Publishers Weekly interviewThe other is the history of how he came to be there. This will also remind one of the back and forth of the on-Mars and Earth-politics alternating streams of Weir\u2019s mega best seller.Although his writing is out of this world, Weir\u2019s process ain\u2019t exactly rocket science. Like his characters, he uses available parts, plus a base of knowledge, to build what needs to be built. He had a few lying about in his shop.After The Martian, I had this idea for this massive space epic\u2014a traditional sci-fi pilot with aliens, faster-than-light travel, and telepathy and a war and, yeah, a ten-book series and everything. I worked on it for about a year; it was going to be called Zhek. I got 70,000 words in, and\u2026I realized that it sucked\u2026But there are a few nuggets in Zhek that were solid. There was one interesting character who was this absolutely no-nonsense woman with a ruthless drive to get what she needs to get done and a tremendous amount of secret authority. And she became Stratt in Project Hail Mary. The other thing is, in Zhek there was this substance called black matter, which was a technology invented by aliens that would absorb all electromagnetic waves, all light, and turn it into mass and then turn it back into light\u2026if humanity got ahold of some of that, it would be neat, but it would suck if we accidentally let any of that get into the sun\u2014that would be a disaster. I'm like, \u201cWait a minute, that would be a disaster! That's where books come from!\u201d - from the Goodreads interviewAnd divorce lawyer billables. Love his evident excitement at this EUREKA moment. There is a decided innocence to it, and a natural-born optimist\u2019s way of seeing the bright side of life, a characteristic with which Weir very successfully endows his leads, well, some of them anyway. I quite enjoyed The Martian, despite Watney\u2019s immutable self. And I liked Artemis as well, with its more nuanced lead. This one feels like more of a throwback to his earlier work. If you loved The Martian you are gonna love this one. Tough situation, far from home, charming, brilliant, smartass lead, with an adorable, brilliant, very non-human mensch of a pal, lots of mostly accessible science, and some fabulously interesting concepts. For a book that is pretty down to earth in many ways, Project Hail Mary is absolutely out of this world. Science teachers know a lot of random facts.Review posted \u2013 May 7, 2021Publication date \u2013 May 4, 2021Thanks to Ballantine books for an early look at Project Hail Mary and to MC (you know who you are) for interceding on my behalf to make that happen.

It turns out that I have very little brain for physics: I will understand it about as long as it takes a highly competent teacher to explain it to me and no longer. So when Weir started pulling out the physics calculations in Project, my attention immediately wandered, so much so that I wondered if it was going to be a DNF. Then he pulled a rabbit (view spoiler)[or rather, an alien (hide spoiler)] out of the hat.I enjoyed The Martian, where Weir used his science cribbing to good effect, solving problems of air, growing potatoes, poop disposal, and heat. Unfortunately, in Project, just like astrophysics, it\u2019s all about the mental gymnastics to make some calculations. Oh sure, there might be exciting consequences down the line. But a lot of the \u2018magic\u2019 comes down to pencil-and-paper calculations (or even worse, mental calculations). You know what\u2019s not exciting? Math. I love math, but math is not exciting. It\u2019s orderly and satisfying, but it is not exciting, and although I appreciate how Weir tries to translate solving equations into their real-world applications of velocity, light and heat. As an example, early in the story there\u2019s a bit where our hero is working out his velocity:\u201cHmm, 11,872 kilometers per second. Velocity is relative. It doesn\u2019t make any sense unless you are comparing two objects. A car on the freeway might be going 70 miles per hour compared to the ground, but compared to the car next to it, it\u2019s moving almost 0. So what is that \u2018measured velocity\u2019 measuring the velocity of? I think I know. I\u2019m in a spaceship, right? I have to be. So that value is probably my velocity. But compared to what? Judging by the big ol\u2019 picture of the sun over the text, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the sun. So I\u2019m going 11,872 meters per second with respect to the sun.\u201dPssst--Wake up! Yeah, I feel you; that was me nodding off in class after lunch. Oh gosh\u2013and don\u2019t get me started on the \u2018spin drive.\u2019 Despite including an illustration in the front of the book, it did not compute.Written in first person, the narrator is the same voice from The Martian, Mark Watney, albeit with substitutions\u2013\u201cdarn,\u201d \u201check,\u201d \u201cgosh\u201d\u2013for the cursing and overall less personality. There\u2019s a dual timeline, which adds tension to both the historical situation and the current one. Despite knowing the eventual outcome of the historical timeline (obviously, it leads to the current timeline), Weir still manages a couple of surprises.However, I don\u2019t know that Weir\u2019s writing has improved. Yes, there\u2019s lots of jokes and snark, and humor will carry one a long way. But read this awkward thought, originally singled out for its wry humor:\u201cI am not rested at all. Every pore of my being yells at me to go back to sleep, but I told Rocky I\u2019d be back in two hours and I wouldn\u2019t want him to think humans are untrustworthy.I mean\u2026 we\u2019re pretty untrustworthy, but I don\u2019t want him to know that.\u201dYes, all sorts of questionable construction. \u2018At all\u2019\u2013necessary? Just awkward. Yes, I know people speak like this. But there\u2019s a reason most authors leave these meaningless modifiers off their sentences. \u2018Every pore\u2019? Really? Our science guy says \u2018pores\u2019 can rest? This is the phrase Weir comes up with? And using the word \u2018untrustworthy\u2019 twice may be deliberate, but why not use \u2018are\u2019 instead of the contraction to emphasize it? It\u2019s these little things that stand out when one reads slowly and/or carefully that really makes Weir a second-tier writer for me. He\u2019s funny, sure. But so was Dave Barry and Erma Bombek. Remember them? Of course not.I\u2019ll leave discussion on plot points under the spoiler section. Suffice it to say that it both captured my interest but raised my science-disbelief index. Like a magician, Weir is busy showing us his \u2018work\u2019 so he can distract us from the real trick: getting us to believe in Rocky. I\u2019m not complaining; after repeated attempts to pull my attention back to the book, Rocky is what sustained it. But there\u2019s a lot of short-handed science there. Interestingly, it takes Rocky to really bring the emotional component into the book. Unlike Mark Watney, who had a family and crewmates, our intrepid science teacher seems to have no one. Literally. It\u2019s hard to connect with a character who isn\u2019t rooted in any relationships. When Rocky shows up, all that changes, which both saves and perhaps moves the story further into the \u2018fantasy\u2019 parts of science-fiction. (view spoiler)[I didn't believe Rocky. Or I did, but then didn't, as soon as he turned out to be human-in-a-spider-body (hide spoiler)]There was one section where Ryland Grace, the science teacher, is basically saying, \u201cif a spaceship leaves Sol at X speed and another spaceship leaves Tau at Y speed, when will the two spaceships meet up?\u201d This is basically Andy Weir\u2019s answer to all those people making fun of story problems in math.

It\u2019s impossible to talk about Project Hail Mary without comparing it to the author\u2019s bestselling smash,  The Martian. Both books revolve about a man discovering he\u2019s alone, far from Earth, facing an impossible task. Admittedly, the stakes in this book are quite a bit higher. If Mark Watney failed, he would die; if Ryland Grace fails, all of humanity may die. Why? Funny you should ask, because at first Ryland can\u2019t remember either. So the story moves back and forth between what\u2019s happening in the present and memories he\u2019s starting to recover that explain why he\u2019s alone on a spaceship millions of miles from Earth with humanity\u2019s fate in his hands.Ryland Grace isn\u2019t exactly like Mark Watney, but they\u2019re definitely more similar than they are different. So once again, there\u2019s a lot of deadpanned humor and sarcasm in this story. And like with  The Martian, the main character is once again a relatively ordinary person who is somehow also able to perform a staggering amount of tasks\u2014theoretical, engineering, astronaut stuff, and more!\u2014that it stretches the bounds of believability. With all that said, Project Hail Mary is a difficult book to talk about because it has a secret that I\u2019m simply unwillingly spoil. It\u2019s revealed about a quarter of the way in\u2014early enough that a person could bail if it was a hard pass for them. But while it took me a little while to accept what was happening, once I did I really enjoyed this book. Yes, some plot points get resolved mighty conveniently at times, but that doesn\u2019t stop the story from working really well. It\u2019s fun and very imaginative, with some good action sequences and a couple of nice twists. Maybe most of all, as with  The Martian, there\u2019s a sense of joy about science and discovery in these pages that\u2019s just a pleasure to read.

In a story heavy on science and technology, which might not appeal to some readers, but which I found interesting, Dr Ryland Grace is a scientist who gravitated towards high school teaching after becoming a pariah in the scientific community with his 'wild' theory that you don't need water for life to exist. Grace awakens from an induced coma on the spaceship Hail Mary unable to recall who he is or where he is. However, there are two corpses on board, he is the sole survivor, if only he could remember what he meant to be doing.In a narrative that shifts from the past to the present, Grace's memory comes back slowly, how he came to be at the heart of global efforts to come together to address the catastrophe in the form of the Petrova task force under the global leadership of its director, Eva Stratt, a driven woman who sweeps aside any obstacles and people who stand in her path with unnerving ease, paying no heed to laws, patents, ethics or morality, accessing the brightest minds, technology and any resource needed in her fight to save the Earth as we know it and its people. We learn of the challenges that arise, and when it becomes clear that there may be possible answers and hope on Tau Ceti, the only place where Astrophage is being destroyed, this leads to the development of the Hail Mary project and the recruitment of the best 3 person crew of astronauts and scientists to go to Tau Ceti, a crew willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Grace's life brightens up considerably when he encounters the wonderfully quirky and charming Rocky, the two of them develop a beautifully co-operative, poignant and emotionally close relationship despite all their initial communication issues, but can the two of them save their respective worlds? This is a wonderfully engaging read that kept my interest throughout, and whilst I liked Grace, for me, the real star of the show was the unforgettable Rocky. I was completely invested in the challenges and threats Grace and Rocky face, there are twists and turns galore, and a surprising conclusion. I think most fans of Andy Weir will love this, and I recommend this highly to all readers, even those who may not consider sci-fi to be their reading genre.

Imagine The Martian as a box of cereal that\u2019s been reformulated, rebranded, and relaunched with promo bursts like: \u201cSame great sarcasm!\u201d \u201cNow with even higher stakes!\u201d \u201cFortified with more science!\u201d \u201cNew and improved female characterization!\u201d \u201cAdorable alien life form gift with purchase!\u201d Can I blame the author for giving people what they want again after tumbling over a turd like Artemis? No I cannot. Can I help you try to decide which format to choose for this one? I can try.Audiobook:- Ray Porter narrates (presumably because Wil Wheaton was either busy or the producers realized having him do it would turn Ryland Grace 100% into Mark Whatney). Porter can be a little hammy for my tastes, but many people love him.- The story dips in and out between Grace\u2019s present on the spacecraft and past on Earth leading up to his mission. There are no discernible markers other than dangling, unfinished sentences\u2026 so it can be tricky to notice the time shifted. - Grace meets an alien named Rocky who communicates initially through tones and eventually through pixelated/robotic English. On audio his voice is fun fun fun!- The title is an Audible Exclusive, so you won\u2019t be able to find it from other audiobook services or through your library apps like Hoopla or Libby. Bad bad bad.Print:- An illustration of Grace\u2019s spacecraft is included.- Time shifts are easy to recognize.- Rocky\u2019s native tonal language is represented by musical notes.- You get the author\u2019s Acknowledgements, but he basically just thanks people.It\u2019s almost a toss up, but for my money I\u2019d give the edge to experiencing this story in print. Better do it before the movie starring Ryan Gosling comes out. Amaze! ;)Blog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/.", "4.5 stars! On sale now.

On sale now. Review first posted on FantasyLiterature.com: It\u2019s alarming to wake up from a coma in completely unfamiliar surroundings, tethered to a bed by tubes and electrodes, with a computer voice quizzing you and robotic arms controlling your movements. It\u2019s even more disturbing when you realize that you have no recollection of your name or your past life, and that there are two long-dead bodies in the room with you.But gradually, through a series of flashback memories, Ryland Grace remembers that Earth is facing an extinction event: a Russian scientist discovered that a strange line has developed between the sun and Venus, and it\u2019s causing the sun to lose energy at a rate that\u2019s high enough to cause a worldwide ice age in the next few decades. Grace, a disgraced molecular biologist who abandoned academia to teach middle school science, was one of the scientists investigating the unique microorganisms, christened Astrophage, causing the sun\u2019s disastrous decline in energy.Now his explorations of his current surroundings lead him to the realization that he\u2019s in a spaceship headed to the Tau Ceti star system, on a one-way trip in search of a way to save the Earth, and the other two members of his crew didn\u2019t survive the medically-induced comas during the long voyage of the Hail Mary. But a major surprise awaits Grace at his destination: humanity isn\u2019t the only race looking to the Tau Ceti system for a possible answer to the problem of Astrophage.Andy Weir\u2019s latest science fiction adventure, Project Hail Mary, marks a welcome return to form for fans of The Martian, after his lackluster second novel, Artemis. There\u2019s the same hyper-focus on fine details of technology and science, one of Weir\u2019s hallmarks, along with a series of critical events that our intrepid main character needs to overcome through a combination of scientific knowledge and inventiveness. Ryland Grace, who narrates the novel, also bears a distinct resemblance to Mark Watney: he\u2019s an enthusiastically geeky and inventive scientist with an engaging voice and sense of humor, faced with a life-and-death situation.\u201cHow did you do it? What killed it?\u201d\u201cI penetrated the outer membrane with a nanosyringe.\u201d\u201cYou poked it with a stick?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d I said. \u201cWell. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a very scientific stick.\u201dBut the stakes are higher here, the adventure more far-reaching, and there\u2019s a subtle complexity to Grace\u2019s character that is fully revealed toward the end, along with a (related) twist in the narrative that is logical but still managed to surprise me. Weir displays some subtleties in his writing in Project Hail Mary that go beyond his previous works of fiction. Weir also handles the dual timeline in this novel well, with the flashbacks flowing naturally as a result of Grace\u2019s slowly-dispersing amnesia. These memories gradually fill in the background and reveal the full scope of the Astrophage problem and the reasons and hopes for Grace\u2019s current mission, while the current timeline follows his adventures and mishaps once he reaches the ship\u2019s destination \u2026 and beyond.Much of Project Hail Mary is about Grace\u2019s unanticipated friendship with another character who is tremendously pleasing in both his sheer alienness and his open-heartedness toward Ryland. While my practical mind debated the wisdom of Grace and the alien oversharing information about the location of their home worlds (I was deeply influenced by Murray Leinster\u2019s classic novelette \u201cFirst Contact\u201d at an impressionable age), their developing trust and friendship is undeniably heartwarming.Great books and movies are often marked by their attention to themes of love and redemption, and Project Hail Mary has both in spades. (I\u2019m still trying to decide whether the title and the main character\u2019s name are a deliberate call-out by Weir to \u201cHail Mary, full of Grace.\u201d I\u2019m inclined to think it is.) In any case, these compelling themes, plus a suspenseful, page-turning adventure and the inspiring scientific creativity of the characters (assuming you\u2019re a reader who enjoys Weir\u2019s attention to technical details in his plots), make Project Hail Mary a sure-fire hit for fans of The Martian \u2026 and may very well win him new fans.Initial post: Just when I'd given up, my NetGalley request for this book got approved! This time Andy Weir came much closer to the magic that was The Martian. :).", "***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY***I requested this book just based on the fact that I enjoyed the movie \u201cThe Martian\u201d. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.The beginning of the book is a little confusing, mainly because our narrator has just woken up from an induced coma and does not really know where he is, why he is there and who the two CORPSES ARE THAT ARE IN THE ROOM WITH HIM!!!!!!!! He is having trouble moving, speaking, etc and is connected by so many IV\u2019s and electrodes that he is completely incapable ***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY***I requested this book just based on the fact that I enjoyed the movie \u201cThe Martian\u201d. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.The beginning of the book is a little confusing, mainly because our narrator has just woken up from an induced coma and does not really know where he is, why he is there and who the two CORPSES ARE THAT ARE IN THE ROOM WITH HIM!!!!!!!! He is having trouble moving, speaking, etc and is connected by so many IV\u2019s and electrodes that he is completely incapable of doing anything at first. However he is being helped by an extremely \u201call knowing\u201d computer and a set of robotic arms. The arms provide him with a sort of food, dictate when he needs to sleep some more and talks to him, asking him questions that at first he can\u2019t answer. He can\u2019t even remember his name.So this is our first POV, and this narrator turns out to be Ryland Grace, a former science teacher that somehow was sent into space along with two trained scientists. We find out what is happening at the same time that Grace does which is interesting. Turns out these three were the earth\u2019s \u201cHail Mary\u201d team, sent into space to try to stop an alien life form that is taking away our sun\u2019s energy. Of course if the sun\u2019s light disappeared, SO WOULD HUMANS!!!!!!!!!The second POV is what happened on earth with Ryland and a team of scientists. All of the meetings and tests, all of the technicalities of sending a team that far into space. It\u2019s decided that the astronauts would have to be put in an induced coma to handle that long of a flight. There are only so many people whose bodies can handle an induced coma. This might well be a mission to save earth but the astronauts would probably not survive a return trip, so it\u2019s more or less a suicide mission. How Ryland gets to be one of the ones chosen for the flight I will leave you to discover. I will tell you this much, HE HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER!!!!!!!!! For the first third of the book I was increasingly annoyed by the constant stream of scientific terms which I didn\u2019t understand and I wish those sections could have been shortened. As it was I ended up skimming through a lot of the technicalities. It was only then that I could relax and just enjoy the story.The introduction of a friendly alien life form definitely upped my enjoyment of the book. How Grace and \u201cRocky\u201d get to know each other and work together to save the earth was fun to read. How they communicate reminded me of the 1977 movie \u201cClose Encounters of The Third Kind\u201d. Of course since it\u2019s science fiction, you have to expect that there are parts that are hard to believe, but interesting to think about. All in all I enjoyed the book once I concentrated more on the characters and less on the scientific technicalities.

She was certain that she had once again concealed her distrust from me; I perceived both things: her ruthless acumen and her magnanminity. At the time I didn\u2019t know what vastness is, but I felt it: being able to comprise so many and such conflicting things, knowing that seeming incompatibles can all be valid at once, being able to feel that without perishing of fear, having to name that and think about it, the true glory of human nature\u2014that was really what I learned from her.This takes patience, but my patience was rewarded.

I will try to explain how this unceremonious drop around the middle of the story came to pass after introducing Victoria to you. There is nothing victorious about Victoria apart from the fact that she survived to see her eighteen's birthday. Even social worker Meredith sees her only as a failure she personally doesn't deserve. A dark blotch on her white sheet of professional accomplishments: For Victoria has been a foundling baby, abandoned at an age that usually makes finding families willing to adopt an easy task. But somehow Victoria left and was made to leave foster family after foster family, fought in between for affection, food and physical integrity among cruel or indifferent caretakers and fellow foster kids as emotionally messed up and adapted to the loveless situations of their short lives as herself, botched up her last and only chance at a permanent solution at the age of eleven, drove Meredith crazy for the remaining seven years by countless court trials and group home fights and now, on her eighteen's birthday, the day the State of California finally rids itself from the responsibily of its parentless ward's well-being, she does not react as frightened and subdued as Meredith wished her to. On the contrary: She does not use her final three months time in the transition home to hunt for a job and find a room. She spends her days stealing flowers from communal flower beds and people's gardens to plant them in milk cartons, unconcerned about flooding and molding the carpet. On the day of her eviction into unassisted adulthood Victoria takes her flowers and moves into the concealed shrubbery of the town's recreactional area. Hunger and cold do not drive her into wanting to change her homeless lifestyle, but fear of physical abuse does, when drunk men invade her fragile sanctuary at night. Though paperless she persuades an overworked Russian florist Renata to take her on as a weekend assistant by demonstrationg her astonishing knowledge about flowers and her extraordinary skill at creating bouquets. So far so good.Now you would think you will see the friendship between Victoria and her new boss grow and grow and grow, some relapses to occur, love to enter her life in small, hesitant steps \u2026 Yes, I agree, that would maybe mean walking the edge of tear-jerker-like soppy, drenched in the sickly smell of forget-me-nots and red roses. But I did not expect the story to rely so heavily on flashbacks to Victoria's time on Elizabeth's vine-yard - which triggered her all-consuming obsession about the meaning each decorative plant used to have in European culture \u2013 that climax in revealing the outrageous reason for the planned adoption to go amiss (view spoiler)[Her actions made me really irrevocably hate Elizabeth. That was inexcusable to do to someone who felt loved and wanted for the very first time (hide spoiler)] and for Victoria to go finally - and understandably - feral. My initially strong connection to Victoria slowly began to unravel, when she starts to get to know / date Grant, a young flower-farm owner she fleetingly knows from her childhood. I understood her reserve, her mistrust, her outstretched feelers. But I resented her self-centered, cat-and-mouse-style behavior (view spoiler)[ and it really failed me how she first sleeps under Grant's kitchen table to protect herself from him and has him sleep outside the house while she locks all doors, but suddenly decides to let him use her body without really wanting him and without spending even half a thought on contraception. There must have been dozens of pregnant or infected girls in the foster homes to observe. (hide spoiler)]. A friend of mine said Diffenbaugh's style reminded him a lot of the novels by Sarah Addison Allen. I do understand, because the works of both contain dark pasts and the woven-in magic of fruits or flowers or gardens. My association goes into a different direction, though: The heroine Victoria and her actions reminded me the most of is Carly from Raw Blue by Kirsty Eagar. If you liked the romance in that novel, you might enjoy Victoria's and Grant's love-story as well. The last thread between Victoria and me was torn when she declines everyone's help (view spoiler)[ during her pregnancy and especially after the birth of her daughter (hide spoiler)], but selfishly makes the persons around her maintain, support, sacrifice, worry, plan and work for her even more than if she had accepted being advised and assisted right in the beginning. Why does she stop working? (view spoiler)[Why does she move back into the forest during her pregnancy, depriving her unborn kid of warmth, vitamins and proper nourishment needed to thrive inside her womb? (hide spoiler)] She could have managed. And why does she start her own and illegal wedding flowers business \u2013 a bitter competition to her boss' business when she could have just asked Renata to integrate her unique service into her shop's palette for a more generous salary? Since she was still using Renata's wholesale card to buy the flowers she needed, Renata could have easily done her in by simply reporting her to the authorities. (view spoiler)[Plus, I hated the exclusiveness, that garantees her only successful mouth-to-mouth propaganda: She decides only to carter to couples who look like they will stay together, which later could be attributed to Victoria's choice of flowery accessories. The bouquets themselves are prepared by homeless girls, because only the flowers' happiness-inducing magic will be important for the wedding. How the bridal centerpiece looked and smelled and lasted, is of no concern whatsoever. A highly unlikely concept in my opinion. I, personally, would never, ever use Victoria's \"Message\" service. If I wanted, I could look up any flower's meaning by myself and I would not pay attrocious prices to have clumsily gathered mosses and leaves on my dinner table. (hide spoiler)] I need to stress that I actually have thought maybe it's me, maybe I have just not enough stomach lining and empathy for the broken mind of someone with a devastating childhood. The author information at the end of the book mentions that Vanessa Diffenbaugh has personal first-hand experience with raising foster kids. Apparently she gave home to one or more. After reading the book I do not question that at all. But when I compare my reading experience of The Language of Flowers to that of other stories featuring difficult or hard-to-like main characters, I am sure that a truely skillful author can make me feel and ache and root for any  protagonist, no matter how strange or evil. I have just finished reading Froi of the Exiles (yes, it is Fantasy, I know). Fact is, when I was reading the volume preceeding it, I would have never guessed Melina Marchetta would get me to like him. Now I love him fiercely. Maybe his personal growth is fantastical, unrealistic, but maybe it is simply magic. The kind of magic only the best authors can evoke in a reader's mind. Because of that believe I do not feel any reservations to rate the second half of this book only with two stars in contrast to my four star expectation in the beginning.Completely off-track, but on my mind: If you like flower-shop-based plots, you might perhaps enjoy the Japanese movie Oto-na-ri. It is about a lonely thirty-something florist and a celebrity photographer, who dreams of shooting Canadian landscapes, living wall-to-wall in an apartment building without meeting each other. It is sad and funny and bittersweet.

Synopsis:Foster child ages out of the system, plants a garden in a city park, sleeps under a bush.Meets a florist who gives her a job, meets a man, rents a tiny blue room.Gets pregnant, runs away to sleep under the bush.Has baby, runs away to sleep under the bush.Give baby away.Happy ending.The problems I have with this are that there isn\u2019t any reason for any of the people who help this girl to want to help her. She snarls and sulks and is so hard and distant that I was left wondering why any of these people wanted to be around her let alone assist her. No one knows her sad/bitter/hostile history and she isn't talking so why should they feel anything for her? It didn\u2019t appear that under all her anger that there was a gentle caring person. She seems more that if you scratched the surface, first of all, you\u2019d definitely get scratched back, but that under that tough exterior, you\u2019d find something even harder and more unyielding. Can\u2019t say that I liked Victoria much. So can you enjoy a book when you don\u2019t really like the protagonist? I find it can be difficult, but in the hands of a crafted writer, you can still enjoy the story. I didn\u2019t find that to be true here. For me, the story would have been better told in third person. I think some distance between Victoria\u2019s mean thought process and the reader would have helped. I didn\u2019t much like being in this misanthropic head and I didn\u2019t get any idea of anyone else\u2019s motivation for caring for her. Why did Renata hire her? Yes, she\u2019s a magical flower genius, but why would she want this girl around, glaring at her customers? Yes, lots of glaring.And Grant, why is he attracted to her? Does he have a thing for mean women? More snarling and glaring. He seems like a very gentle soul to be that way, didn\u2019t understand what he saw in her, other than her ability to send messages by flowers.Victoria\u2019s negativity was so over the top. She finds out she\u2019s pregnant and hates the idea of a baby, but won\u2019t get an abortion because the idea that someone else would have control over her body for the time it would take to get the thing out (that\u2019s how she thinks of it) is too horrid for her to think about. She is offered medical benefits by her employer, but instead she runs away to live under a bush. No, I am most certainly not kidding. Having decided to have the baby and afterward figure out what she\u2019s going to do with it, she gets no prenatal care, not even bothering so little as to pick up a bottle of prenatal vitamins at the drugstore. No, she\u2019s too busy hiding under the bush. And she spent hours in the library comparing flower meaning dictionaries(and countless hours photographing flowers with old time camera which she spends money on the film development even though she has very little money), but didn't bother to read one single book on pregnancy or child care. So, again, not that first doctor visit and she knows a midwife, willing and ready to help her, but she doesn\u2019t want that either. She\u2019s going to give birth at home, alone, all by herself, because ... I have no idea what is wrong with her at this point. Many people have shown her that they care about her, that they\u2019re willing to help her, but she can\u2019t accept it. I get that we\u2019re supposed to believe that she\u2019s so broken(she was an abandoned baby who never found a real forever home) that she sees herself as unworthy of anyone\u2019s concern, but how it came off to this reader is that she\u2019s too selfish and stubborn to do what\u2019s right. This is when my connection to her broke down completely.Also, after hiding in the bush, she comes back, continuing to hide while also building herself an amazing floral designing business. Uh-huh. I believe my suspension of disbelief was at the breaking point by this time.Well, what a surprise, she isn\u2019t able to have the baby all by herself so she gets help and after a week(during which she doesn't bother to even name the child), she gives it away (not for adoption), even though she could have asked for help, could have at the very least told someone when that person is there, in the room with her, asking her how she\u2019s doing, that she wasn\u2019t doing well. But no, she cannot do that. I have no idea why. And no one, not one single person, asks her where her child went. Not one. Did she bury it in her garden in the park? Toss it in the ocean? Where is it? I know this is fiction, but that can't excuse complete disregard for life as it is or common sense. It's based in the real world. If a woman had a child she didn't want and that child disappeared a week later, that woman is going to be getting a serious visit from the police. Yet, she comes back without the child, glares all round, states that she won't talk about it and they all accept it. Really? REALLY?I can\u2019t recommend this one. Too irritating in style, characterization and unlikely plot..", "Can't remember when I've read and enjoyed a story as much as Victoria's.

Heart wrenching storyline. Endearing and unforgettable characters. This was done to perfection.Victoria is a young woman who grew up in foster care system. Emotionally damaged by the back and forth between numerous foster homes and group homes, she is unable to maintain healthy relationships. She constantly chooses self-destructing behaviour and pushes herself away from those who care. Her one true connection is to the language of flowers which is how she makes her mark in the world. Each plant and flower holds a true meaning and when placed skillfully and precisely in an arrangement, conveys deep meaning.I adored Victoria! She is flawed and insecure, yet strong and set in her ways. I had a deep connection with her from the first chapter and whole-heartedly enjoyed following her emotional and heart-wrenching journey. There is a strong theme of motherhood among these pages, specifically mother-daughter relationships, that will stay with me a long time. The relationships within this novel are complex and emotional. I was completely immersed within each of Victoria\u2019s relationship, finding myself analyzing each scenario and situation the characters found themselves in. Though I did not agree with many of Victoria\u2019s personal choices, I was committed to rooting for her to find true happiness and contentment. This is a beautiful book that has earned a spot on my Favourites List. It is one to be savoured and not rushed through. I highly recommend and look forward to reading more from this very talented author..", "Sorry if I post this review twice.

I have always had a fascination with knowing the names history of flowers and plants and love finding them in natural surroundings. This book, The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh, (whose name is similar to the dieffenbachia plant) had such a moving story line in telling the story of Victoria, from her abandonment at birth, through childhood abuse, to her orphanage experiences and her difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. Victoria\u2019s life is portrayed with a depth of a feeling that pulls the reader into caring about this strange and sometimes difficult young woman. The story moves back and forth in time and place within the span of her life which brings greater meaning to why she behaves the way she does with people she meets. Victoria reminds me of several young people I have met and worked with over the years. They may be prickly but also may produce the most beautiful lives, just as some thorny plants produce soft and beautiful flowers. It is a story that can lift you up with expectation and hope, and than then bring you down and make you sad. It is a roller coaster ride of resiliency and success combined with sadness and disappointment. The idea of pouring over dusty and seldom read book after book in the personal pursuit of creating your own book of flowers and their meanings struck a cord with me. What a quiet and resolved drive and passion Victoria kept mentally reconnecting to her childhood to find understanding and meaning in her own life. There was a personal relationship with the flowers Victoria worked with and it was evident with all those who became involved in her world.\t\u201cThe flower you\u2019re looking for is clearly the common thistle, which symbolizes misanthropy. Misanthropy means hatred or mistrust of humankind.\u201d\t\u201cDoes humankind mean everybody?\u201d\t\u201cYes,\u201d\t\u201cI thought about this. Misanthropy. No one had ever described my feelings in single word.\u201dI received this as an early reviewer copy and appreciate the opportunity to have read this book. It is hard to believe that this was a debut novel and Vanessa\u2019s own experiences as a foster mother and teacher shine through in this novel. For me this was an outstanding selection and I will be recommending this book as a book club read. I rate it as a full 5 star book..", "Reading \"The Language of Flowers\" by Vanessa Diffenbaugh I found it to be an unexpectedly beautiful read!

[FYI: My other two favourite flowers (Orchids and lilies) mean refined beauty and majesty respectively, so that's better :)]Anyway, I really really loved this book. I wasn't sure at first and that's why I put it off for so long, but once I picked it up I was completely engrossed. This book had a great dreamy almost magical realism feel about it. And magical realism is my favourite kind of realism. I love the characters, even when I hated them, and the writing was just glorious without being too... wait for it.... *cough* flowery. Ms Diffenbaugh's story was perfectly constructed; with all these little layers added on and meshed together. I think I loved the 'past' chapters marginally more than I liked the \"present\" ones, for I adored Elizabeth. But then we have Grant.... oh Grant. \u2665\"For years my message-laden flowers had been faithfully ignored, an aspect of my communication style that gave me comfort. Passion, connection, disagreement, or rejection: None of these was possible in a language that did not elicit a response. But the single sprig of mistletoe, if the give did indeed understand its meaning, changed everything.\"*Girly sigh*Without spoiling it too much, I really loved the ending. Victoria is a flawed character and she is not always likeable. AT ALL. But I really appreciated the ending that she was given. I think I could have gone either way, but Ms Diffenbaugh chose the right one. Maybe it's just me, but I like it when books end with the beginning of a new journey.

This book deserves better but I thought I'd finish off by sending Ms D a little message.... of the floral kind, about my feelings about this book.*clears throat*Dear Ms Diffenbaugh,I present you with a trilliam to represent modest beauty. I was prepared for this book to lose me completely because of high-brow, literaryness, and get too tangled up in a vine-like metaphor. But it didn't. It's a very subtle and quiet book and it's wonderful. And I present you with some lupine which means imagination because wow, this premise was brilliant. I also give you a few yellow roses because, as we know, they could also represent jealousy. And I am jealous that I didn't come up with this story. *grumbles*I also present you with a purple rose, because this book had me enchanted. I also have this can of tinned pineapple (I'm sure it counts) which means \"You are perfect\"... if you could just give that to Grant for me? Thanks.And, nearly done, here is some raspberry.

The Language of Flowers is a story about Victoria, now a young woman, who was recently emancipated from the court system at 18. She struggles with feelings of abandonment and low self-esteem, as a result of a series of events from her past, stemming from growing up as an orphan. She lives in San Francisco and works in a flower shop. She has no friends, limited relationships, and initially, pretty limited human interaction. Without directly stating this, it becomes clear that she\u2019s afraid of getting close to people, for fear of hurting them as she expects she will yet again, be a disappointment. The book shifts between Victoria\u2019s life in present day, described above, and her life as a child, predominately in one of her foster homes at age 9. The story easily transitions back and forth between the two time periods. In addition to the flowers themselves, Victoria\u2019s foster mother, Elizabeth, and Elizabeth\u2019s nephew, Grant, are also central characters in the story. At times I thought Victoria was intentionally dislikable, and constantly engaging in self-destructive behavior. I realized though that her abandonment issues played a big role in why she chose to do some of the things she did. Despite my dislike of Victoria for a fair portion of the book, I really enjoyed the story, although a bit darker than I was expecting. I did like the ending of the story too.

Wonderful read ...an easy 4 \u272e.", "Imagine a little baby as the seed of beautiful flower who travels from birth to fruition through orphanages, group homes, foster care and the social system of America, never falling in fertile soil to take route and thrive?

But then, as destiny would have it, Victoria Jones lands on a flower and vineyard farm in California where the secrets of the Victorian Floriography of the plants is revealed to this girl who only understood the human language of rejection and unworthiness to be loved. She claimed that she could not read or write, yet understood, and collected, books on botany which was her only real connection to the world and also the key to her psyche when she met Elizabeth on her farm. For the first time in her young life as a nine-year-old girl, Victoria's soul can be unlocked by a person who understood completely and spoke 'her' language.Through the language of flowers she reconnects to the world, learns to trust and forgive. The language of flowers was the only language she could trust. The one way of communication she could be totally honest in. As time passes and she becomes a young adult, she learns to write her own floral dictionary in which she re-evaluated the different flowers. She basically changed the destiny of the flowers by changing their meanings. But to get to that point, she had to first lash out and destroy, the only way she learnt how to cope with her world. A long road of redemption and forgiveness was her destiny.Victoria was not a likable young girl and she did unforgivable harm to people, which she also had to forgive herself for. The word 'hate' came easily to her, but it would take a wise woman to teach her that hate can be passionate, disengaged, dislike, but also fear. Elizabeth taught her that her behavior was a choice, not who she was. I was surprised by this book. It was so much different from what I expected and well worth the read. Of course I never believed in floriography since it resembled the human impulse to box everything up without consideration of the unfairness of the action. For instance, how cruel can it be to attribute 'Hate' to the cactus plant? Or 'Deceit' and 'Materialism' to the sunflower? I have been involved in botany throughout my adult life and revel in the beauty and magic of all plants. Floriography in all its splendor was never part of it and won't be in the future. I simply regard it as a waste of time. However, planning the story around this theme was an unusual and perhaps ambitious undertaking which informed and entertained. Victoria's struggle to make it through a hostile world was very realistic and captivating. The author managed to mix fantasy and reality in equal measures without losing the plot or the intent. The latter being to capture the life and soul of a little girl lost in in a grown-up world where everybody else decided her destiny until she could finally make that decision herself. She rooted and blossomed. She learnt the language of love in all its different manifestations. However, for her rebirth she had to go through the pain of being born again.RECOMMENDED!.", "2014 F.A.B.

How could Grant fall in love with Victoria immediately after seeing her for the first time since she was 10 years old? How could Renata tell that Victoria would be a wonderful assistant after meeting this homeless looking creature just once. And how did Victoria learn to make such beautiful floral arrangements? There was no mention of this activity when she lived with Elizabeth. They just worked on the meanings. I don't think they even grew many flowers. The floral nursery and gardens belonged to Grant and his mother. How could Victoria get enough money to start her own business? And wasn't it a betrayal of Renata to go into competition with her? Furthermore, wasn't it too contrived that Victoria found the perfect assistance in her former group home? Plus, wasn't it too much of a coincidence that Renata's mother was a midwife? And what about the coincidence that Renata had a sister with a space to rent cheaply?I won't even mention the illogical things that Victoria did because, as I said before, she truly was psychologically disabled. And the happy ending was so sappy. I didn't care to read over and over again the meaning of various flowers. Besides, I do not believe the choices she made for clients really caused all the good results. Actually, I did not believe that a florist could get so much business, so quickly, just by word of mouth. Think I'll stop here. I can't think of anything I liked.

One star means I should not have read the book, why did I bother? But I did read it because it was recommended or I picked it up by mistake.

Three stars means that the story had a good plot as well as good characters. Usually that's enough for me to like a bookFour stars mean good story, characters and plot PLUS good writing. The fifth star is awarded for depth, concept, exceptional language, memorability. In the case of The Language of Flowers, I loved the idea of the book, messages sent with flowers. The book is a romance and as such, the characters were all well defined but just a bit unbelievable. Why was such a horrid, aggressive, uncommunicative, misfit like the \"heroine\" tolerated, let alone loved by people who hardly knew her (about one year of acquaintance)? How could they be so devoted when the side they saw of her was mostly bad and her misdeeds were plentiful? The plot was cleverly done, weaving together the few skills the girl had and her destiny in flowers. But the plot felt contrived too what with the tolerant flower seller, the pregnancy and hiding out in the park then the ugly apartment. The heroines emergence as a potential butterfly after years of caterpillaring existence didn't ring true. Her inner growth and blooming needed more development in the story. Her lover man's devotion was really a puzzle - she was so awful to him. I wanted more about the flower language throughout the book; the author gave us a bit but I wanted lots more. Also the descriptions of places were were not evocative enough to give me a real sense of time and environment. This was partly because place references were overburdened with details about feelings and behavior - mostly of the \"heroine\". It was interesting that there wasnt very much about current events - this created a sense of timelessness, probably intended. The story revolves totally around just a few people. This is a fascinating and desperate tale of one orphan's struggle to survive adjust and blossom. Fine, and the story achieved that. I liked the book but I cannot recommend it to all wholeheartedly and cannot give it a five.

Reading it If you had not read The Shining already, the 2013 publication of Doctor Sleep, the sequel, presented an opportunity to revisit one of the best ghost stories of our time, a perfect justification for stepping through those bat-wing doors for the first time.  1st Edition cover \u2013 Published January 28, 1977 \u2013 447 pps It has been a lifetime since I read The Shining for the first time, over thirty years ago. I enjoyed it then for its effectiveness in telling a scary, no, a very scary story. Reading it now is colored, as is all of life, by our accumulation (or lack of accumulation) of experience. We see, or appreciate colors, textures, shapes, structures, and feelings with more experienced, educated eyes. We have seen, or are at least aware of real world things that are scarier than any fictional spectres. So, what does it look like through old, cloudy lenses?It remains a very scary story. The things that stand out for me now are not so much the deader rising up out of a bathtub to pursue a curious child, although that is still pretty creepy, or the mobile topiary, which still works pretty well at making the hair on one\u2019s neck and arms stand at attention. But King was using the haunted house trope to look at more personal demons. And those shine through more clearly now. From Allyn Scura\u2019s blogHe had some drinking issues at the time he wrote the book, when he was 30, and concern about that is major here. Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, no question. He also has issues with anger management, not that the little shit he clocks while teaching at a New England prep school didn\u2019t have it coming. He did. But one cannot do that to a student, however deserving, and expect to remain employed for long. His little boy, however, most certainly did not deserve a broken arm. Jack is very remorseful, and wants to make things right. He manages to get a gig taking care of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter. It will offer him a chance to get something right after a string of getting things wrong, offer a chance to save his marriage, and offer an opportunity to work on his unfinished play. Risky? Sure. But a gamble worth taking. And his wife, Wendy, agrees, despite having serious misgivings. There are no attractive alternatives. Of course, we all know that the Overlook is not your typical residence. Odd things happen, sounds are heard, thoughts from somewhere outside find their way into your mind. Jack is targeted, and boy is he vulnerable.But five-year-old Danny is the real key here. He is the proud possessor of an unusual talent, the shining of the book\u2019s title. Danny can not only do a bit of mind-reading, he can also see things that other people cannot. And for a little guy he has a huge talent. He also has an invisible friend named Tony with whom only he can communicate. It is difficult to think about the book without finding our mental screens flickering with the images of Jack Nicholson in full cartoonish psycho rage, the very effective sound of a Big Wheel followed by a steadicam coursing through the long halls of the hotel, and the best casting decision ever in choosing Scatman Crothers to play Dick Halloran. By the way, the hotel is based on a real-world place, the Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado. And the Overlook\u2019s spooky room 217 was inspired by the supposedly haunted room 217 at the Stanley. This image is from the hotel\u2019s site \u2013 they clearly embrace the spectral connectionThe room number was changed in the film to 237, at the request of the Timberline hotel, which was used for exterior shots. There is so much that differentiates Kubrick\u2019s film from the book that they are almost entirely different entities. The differences do require a bit of attention here. First, and foremost, the book of The Shining is about the disintegration of a family due to alcoholism and anger issues. How a child survives in a troubled family is key. The film is pretty much pure spook house, well-done spook house, but solely spook house, nonetheless, IMHO. There is considerable back-story to Jack and Wendy that gets no screen time. You have to read the book to get that. Jack is a victim, as much as Wendy and Danny. You would never get that from the slobbering Jack of the film. The maze in the book was pretty cool, right? I liked it too, but it does not exist in the book. I believe it was put in to replace the talented topiary, which is the definition of a bad trade. There is significant violence in the book that never made its way into Kubrick\u2019s film, but which very much raises a specter of domestic violence that is terrorizing real people living in real horror stories. There are a few lesser elements. Jack wielded a roque mallet, not an axe. Danny is not interrupted in his travels through the corridors by Arbus-like twin sisters. And the sisters in question are not even twins. There are plenty more, but you get the idea. An interesting film, for sure, but not really the most faithful interpretation of the book. King saw that a film that more closely reflected what he had written reached TV screens in 1997, with a six-hour mini-series version.Irrelevancies of a personal natureThe opening shot was filmed on the  Going\u2013to-the-Sun Road in Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park in Montana. I have had the pleasure (7 times in one visit) and recommend the drive wholeheartedly. It is a pretty narrow road though, so you will have to drive carefully. Bring along the appropriate musical media for the best effect, Wendy Carlos\u2019s Rocky Mountain, and dress warmly. It was below freezing when I reached the top of the road, in August. Some exteriors for Kubrick\u2019s film were shot at the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon. I visited but did not stay there back in 2008. Sadly I do not have any decent personal photos from the place. I can report, though, on a bitThis shot was found on Wikimediaof kitsch. There is a place in the hotel where an ax is lodged in a block of wood, with HEEEEERE\u2019s JOHNNY on the ax, a tourist photo-op. And yes, I did. Sadly, or luckily, the shot did not come out well, so you will be spared.Back to the book, Danny\u2019s talent is a two-edged sword. He is afflicted with seeing more than anyone his age should have to see, but on the other hand, he has a tool he can use to try to save them all. Whether he can or not is a core tension element here. King is fond of placing his stories in literary context. He peppers the text with references to various relevant books and authors. I expect these are meant to let us know his influences. Horace Walpole, author of The Castle of Otranto, a Gothic classic, is mentioned, as is Shirley Jackson, of Hill House fame. King had used a quote from this book in Salem\u2019s Lot. A family saga rich with death and destruction, Cashelmara is mentioned as are some more contemporary items, like The Walton Family, the idealized antithesis to the Torrance Family, Where the Wild Things Are and novelist Frank Norris. The primary literary reference here is Poe\u2019s The Masque of the Red Death, which is cited many times. There had been a costume ball back in hotel\u2019s history and it is the impending climax of that party, the unmasking, that looms here. And toss in nods to Treasure Island and Bluebeard for good measure.King often includes writers in his work, avatars for himself.  I write about writers because I know the territory. Also, you know it's a great job for a protagonist in a book. Without having to hold down a steady job, writers can have all sorts of adventures. Also, if they disappear, it's a long time before they are missed. Heh-heh-heh. \u2013 from an  AOL interviewJack Torrance is a writer as well as a teacher. The play that Jack is writing undergoes a transformation that mirrors Jack\u2019s own. In fact, there is a fair bit or mirroring going on here. Jack\u2019s affection for his father as a kid was as strong as Danny's is for him. His father was an abusive alcoholic. While Jack is not (yet) the monster his father was, he is also an alcoholic with abusive tendencies.  I never had a father in the house. My mother raised my brother and I alone. I wasn\u2019t using my own history, but I did tap into some of the anger you sometimes feel to the kids, where you say to yourself: I have really got to hold on to this because I\u2019m the big person here, I\u2019m the adult. One reason I wanted to use booze in the book is that booze has a tendency to fray that leash you have on your temper\u2026For a lot of kids, Dad is the scary guy. It\u2019s that whole thing where your mother says, \u2018You just wait until your father comes home!\u201d In The Shining, these people were snowbound in a hotel and Dad is always home! And Dad is fighting this thing with the bottle and he\u2019s got a short temper anyway. I was kind of feeling my own way in that because I was a father of small children. And one of the things that shocked me about fatherhood was it was possible to get angry at your kids. (from the EW interview cited in Extra Stuff)He\u2019s right. I have had the pleasure and I know. Wendy gets some attention as well, as we learn a bit about her mother, and see Wendy\u2019s fear that she has inherited elements of her mother\u2019s awfulness. Not everything shines here. There are times when five-year-old Danny seems much older than his tender years, even given his extraordinary circumstances. It struck me as surprising that there is no mention of anyone suggesting that maybe Jack might attend an AA meeting. But these are like single dead pixels on a large screen.If you want to read horror tales that are straight up scare\u2019ems, there are plenty in the world. But if you appreciate horror that offers underlying emotional content, and I know you do, my special gift tells me that The Shining is a brilliant example of how a master illuminates the darkness. This review, with images intact, has also been posted on my blog=============================EXTRA STUFFDefinitely check out the Wiki for this book \u2013 nifty info on the King Family\u2019s stay at the Stanley, and yes, there was a Grady at the Stanley.I also recommend checking out SK\u2019s site if you want to learn more about himAn interview with King in Entertainment WeeklyBTW, here is a shot of the model snowmobile that Dick Halloran drives back to the Overlook A few other SK's we have reviewedUnder the DomeDuma Key Lisey's StoryDoctor SleepRevivalMr. MercedesJust After Sunset.", "i- i don't even know what to say that hasn't already been said about this but lemme give it a shot.god DAMN this is king at his best. i know, i know, \"kat that is so cliche. couldn't you have picked a less popular king book to stan?\"i guess not, but hear me out.1. first of all, i love a good old fashioned haunted house story and that's exactly what this is. the slow progression of madness that overtook jack and the introduction of new ghosts (or hallucinations, whatever you decide) was INCREDIBLi- i don't even know what to say that hasn't already been said about this but lemme give it a shot.god DAMN this is king at his best. i know, i know, \"kat that is so cliche. couldn't you have picked a less popular king book to stan?\"i guess not, but hear me out.1. first of all, i love a good old fashioned haunted house story and that's exactly what this is. the slow progression of madness that overtook jack and the introduction of new ghosts (or hallucinations, whatever you decide) was INCREDIBLE. not to mention the thing that i think king writes best is the feeling of confinement, and what's more confining than being snowed into a haunted hotel that literally wants you dead?? oh right, nothing. 2. the characterization!!! ah! the way that king wrote these characters was just *chefs kiss* not only did i care about danny, wendy, and (sometimes) jack, but we also got to rip back the layers of their relationships with each other and dynamic as a family which i LOVE. even if you don't think this is a great horror story, don't deny it is a baller family drama.3. the horror of it all. whether you want to look at it as a family being attacked by ghosts, or a father being overcome by an extreme case of cabin fever, or even if the whole murdering thing doesn't scare you but you can see the fear that comes with having a family member who battles with some kind of addiction, this book is fucking scary. it may not have made me physically jump or scream, but i can tell you that it's a story that is gonna stick in my brain and not let go for a long long time (just like any good horror should)now for the obligatory comparison to the movie:it's common knowledge that king himself hates the Kubrick movie, but i love it. so much. it's one of the first horror movies i ever saw and i've seen it many times since, so while it's a popular opinion to love the book and shit on the movie i just can't bring myself to do it. yes, they're very different in a lot of ways, but honestly i think that Kubrick did the best with what he had to work with.a BIG part of the novel is rooted in internal conflict. we spend so much time inside of jack, danny, and wendy's heads that it would have been impossible (imo) to translate that to the screen without a near constant voiceover (like basically just the audiobook playing over all the scenes) sO, i can't fault the movie for what it lacks in depth of character and explanation...i just can't. however, if for some reason you're reading this and you have seen the movie but haven't read the book YOU BETTER READ THE FCKING BOOK ARE YOU JOKING?? READ IT.anyway, dear mr. stephen king, i'm sorry i ever said that your popular books were overhyped. some of them are *cough* IT *cough* but this one isn't.luv, katokay that's all read this book i don't have an outro okay byeeeee.", "This scene from Friends pretty much sums up my feelings about this book:\"Rachel: Hmm.

Previously I've picked up one of his doorstops at a time I wasn't prepared to fully invest in the time and energy it takes to immerse oneself into his world building and lengthy details. This time, I was ready. (Also, this was only like 600 pages which felt like a novella compared to IT.) I'm finally able to understand why so many people hold the standard of traditional horror in comparison to this novel. Sure, it has all the creepy crawlies and spooky wookies to get your heart racing, but it's so grounded in reality that I had a hard time rationalizing with myself that \"it's just a story.\" The 150 page set up is well worth the reader's time, as it lays the groundwork for much of the why behind the narrative, and it also gave me a chance to bond with precious Danny before the shit hit the fan. I may be the last person on the planet to have read this book, but just in case I'm not, I wanted to share some of the things that really hit home with me. Just like IT is, at heart, a disturbing coming-of-age story, The Shining was an impeccable tale of extreme cabin fever with a hefty dose of \"the destructive nature of alcoholism\". When you break it down like that, the supernatural elements actually seem to take a backseat to the very real horror of what it's like living with someone struggling through addiction. I've heard all the stories of how this book helped SK realize his own struggle with alcohol, and I'm inclined to believe it's true as the writing here was heavy laden with emotion and depth. I apologize for ever calling Mr. King over-hyped. I'm grateful my previous experiences with his wordier novels didn't deter me from finally choosing to read this, as it's a gem of a book and a classic in it's genre. I still despise Sleeping Beauties though and refuse to change my opinion on the matter. ;) Highly recommended to any other below-the-rock dwellers who may not have happened across this one.

Yeah, yeah, there at the end things got a little hairy, but it was still mostly a human trotting around getting all stabby.Now, I say mostly because good old Jack is getting some help from a couple of freaky paranormal spectres and...THE HEDGES!In an effort to be transparent, I feel like I should mention that I've never actually watched the movie that was based on this bestselling novel. My husband (who has long since stopped being surprised by me) gasped out loud when I told him that a few days ago. So, I'm guessing from his reaction that I'm probably in the minority. Now, normally, whether or not you've seen the movie doesn't matter at all, but this is a pretty iconic movie we're talking about, so even without having seen it, I kind of knew the plot a bit and (of course) knew who acted the starring roles. I know, I know. None of that matters at all when you're talking about a book. But I just thought it might be relevant because the movie is so incredibly well known that even peasants like myself who haven't seen it, immediately recognize certain images from the film.I said that to say this: Jack Nicholson is definitely not the Jack Torrence I was seeing in my head, as described by Stephen King. King's Jack was a handsome young guy who was married to a beautiful woman. Now, Shelly Duval is a fine actor and so is Nicholson. But...Anyway. I was just surprised to find out that the characters in the book were hotties.I've heard the book and movie are very different in a lot of ways, but that both are good if taken separately. I'm planning to rent the movie soon and find out.Alright. The gist is that there's this guy (Jack) who made a few mistakes because he was a bit boozy, and is now trying to go straight and get it together for his family. He's a bit of a pompous ass, truth be told. One of those people who feel as though everyone around them just doesn't understand their tortured genius, you know? But he's not just that guy. Which is where King's brilliance as a writer comes in. He doesn't make Jack the bad guy, he makes Jack a guy. He's trying. He's trying so hard to stay on the wagon, he's trying so hard to be a better husband, and he's trying so hard to be the father Danny deserves.And if he hadn't landed a job at a fucking Haunted Hotel, I truly believe he would have made it work.Or maybe not.Regardless, Jack is only one of the important characters in this Hallmark Family Movie Channel story. You also have Jack's sweet and beautiful (if a bit too mousy and faithful to the old fucker) wife, Wendy. And, of course, their little son, Danny.Danny has The Shine. <--which, when I found this out, FINALLY explained the name of this fucking book to me! Do you know how many years this has been subconsciously niggling at my brain? Well, neither do I.But when fellow psychic, mind reader, and hotel employee, Dick Hallorann, tells Danny what rooms to avoid over the winter because he can feel Danny's super-bright Shine? It was like a puzzle I didn't even know I was trying to solve clicked into place! It was one of those moments you have where you suddenly realize that there's one less thing you don't know. For one brief second, I felt like the universe had given me a high-five I hadn't asked for and then didn't even pull away at the last second.So, what happens when you toss a recovering alcoholic with a penchant towards abusive behavior, an overly-optimistic woman who tends to flutter instead of walk, and a 5 year old who can tell what they are both thinking, inside of a hotel that basically wants to eat them?Well, I don't want to spoil anything for the 3 people who don't know how all this turns out, but...Anyway. Good stuff.

Every last bitter drop.\u201dFor a guy like myself who loves to read and write taking the job as a winter caretaker of The Overlook Hotel sounds like a dream job. The Stanley Hotel inspiration for The Overlook HotelThe time requirements for the job are miniscule leaving me plenty of time every day to work on the next \u201cgreat American novel\u201d. Before leaving for this foray into isolationism I would calculate just how many books I would need to sustain me through the winter and then increase it by \u2153 or so. Jack Torrance makes the case that because he is an educated man he is better suited for the job. \u201cA stupid man is more prone to cabin fever just as he\u2019s more prone to shoot someone over a card game or commit a spur-of-the-moment robbery. He gets bored. When the snow comes, there\u2019s nothing to do but watch TV or play solitaire and cheat when he can\u2019t get all the aces out. Nothing to do but bitch at his wife and nag at the kids and drink. It gets hard to sleep because there\u2019s nothing to hear. So he drinks himself to sleep and wakes up with a hangover. He gets edgy. And maybe the telephone goes out and the TV aerial blows down and there\u2019s nothing to do but think and cheat at solitaire and get edgier and edgier. Finally...boom, boom, boom.\u201dNow Jack may be an educated man but he is carrying around more baggage than any one bellhop could ever get delivered. He has a double helix of trouble an alcohol problem intertwined with a really nasty temper. He has lost jobs. He has beaten a young man senseless. He has broken his son Danny\u2019s arm, little more than a toddler, because he messed up his papers. Jack is always sorry.Jack playing JackWhen not drinking he wipes his lips so often he makes them bleed.His father was a violent man and King does give us some background on Jack\u2019s childhood which may have been intended to lend some sympathy for Jack. Just because we follow the threads back to why he is the way he is doesn\u2019t mean that he is anymore likeable or for that matter less dangerous. He may be an educated man, and he may have made the case as to why he is more qualified to be a caretaker cut off from the world, but as it turns out he wasn\u2019t suited for the job, not suited at all. I was sitting in an American English class at the University of Arizona, what seems like an eon ago, when a woman, older than the rest of us by probably 15 years or so, raised her hand and asked the teacher why we weren\u2019t reading Stephen King for this class. I remember distinctly peering at the syllabus and seeing Steinbeck, Faulkner, Hemingway and Fitzgerald among others. It was the canon of American Literature about to be explored by some of us in depth and by some of us only by way of Cliff Notes or Sparks Notes. Some in the class I could almost pick them out by their shiny perfect teeth, which I found abhorrently boring like trees planted in perfect rows, belonged to the Greek Houses and would be showing up to class only to turn in their papers carefully culled from the vast files of papers written by past Sorority Sisters or Fraternity Brothers who had received As in this class for their efforts. After all it isn\u2019t about learning, but about passing. I\u2019m there probably feeling slightly nauseous from the flashing brilliance of pearly whites from the orthodontically challenged when the teacher turns to me and says \u201cJeff why do you think we aren\u2019t teaching King in this class?\u201dHere I am thinking about this woman wanting to wedge King between my literary hero F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even read King at this point, but I\u2019d been working in a bookstore for many years and knew how important he was to providing me with a paycheck. He developed cross genre appeal bringing horror forward from being a subspecies of science-fiction and away from residing in a spinner rack of books at the back of the bookstore for those social abnormals dressed all in black. I didn\u2019t really know how to answer the question except in the most bland way possible. I said he hasn\u2019t stood the test of time. I could tell my answer was about as satisfying as a week old bagel to the woman, and I was hampered by the fact that I really didn\u2019t want to insult the woman. The teacher also looked mildly disappointed. I could tell she was hoping to see blood in the water and I failed to be the shark she thought me to be. The woman\u2019s question does show the issue about Stephen King that is debated in most literary circles whether they are a book club down at the local library or the academic break room at a major university. He has legions of fans. He makes millions every time he puts out a new book which feels like four times a year. The problem is he is a genius. He isn\u2019t a genius in the way that Pynchon, Gaddis, or Wallace are geniuses. He is a genius storyteller. So if so many people are reading him he really can\u2019t be any good...can he?Someone on GR made the really good point that Stephen King does not need him to buy and read his books. He has writer friends, below the radar, that need his support more. That is so true and one of the more annoying things about King followers is that a percentage of them don\u2019t read anything else. They would come into the bookstore and hound us for the release date of the next Stephen King. I would sweep my hand grandly through the air and point out several other authors that may fill the time between King novels. They simply were not interested. The thing of it is I used to love being one of those scruffy minded individuals that are always trying to find the next great writer before anyone else. There was no reason to read King because there were no points to be scored with my group of pseudo-intellectual friends by saying something so insipid as \u201cis anyone else reading the new King?\u201dWhen I worked at Green Apple Books in San Francisco, which by the way that city is one of the best reading publics in the United States, we catered to University professors, want-to-be writers, actors, and a slew of other professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and bankers. It was a well educated lot to say the least. I thought my days of selling King were over....wrong. Customers with wire rimmed glasses and elbow patches on their tweed jackets would bring up these academic books so obscure that I had no idea we even had them in the store, and invariably in the pile somewhere would be a Stephen King novel. I was still too caught up in my self-image as a reader to really think about taking a walk with the \u201cnormals\u201d and start reading King, but I was starting to think to myself... hmmm I wonder what\u2019s going on in them thar books?Redrum.Murder.Redrum.Murder.(The Red Death held sway over all!)Danny, Jack\u2019s five year old son, has what one character referred to as \u201ca shine\u201d. If people are thinking about something intently, Danny can read their thoughts. He also has an invisible friend named Tony who can take him places, a bit more elaborate than my invisible friend Beauregard. What a dud he turned out to be. Danny loves his father, actually more than his mother Wendy, which is such a painful realization for her. She has stood in the breach. She DIDN'T break his arm. She protects him from everything including his FATHER. As the malevolent force at the hotel begins to exert more and more influence on Jack and Danny she is relatively unaffected by hallucinatory thoughts. The interesting subtext of this novel is that Jack thinks the hotel is after him. As Danny explains:\u201cIt\u2019s tricking Daddy, it\u2019s fooling him, trying to make him think it wants him the most. It wants me the most, but it will take all of us.\u201dA precocious five year old with a brain of such singular existence that the evil entity of The Overlook Hotel must have him. Another interesting aspect of the book is the fact that most people will not be affected by the ghostly influences of the hotel unless they have an imaginative brain to start with. They must have a mind open enough to hear the voices and realize the possibility that they may be real. Did I mention that I\u2019m not really interested in that job anymore?I know this story. I haven\u2019t watched the movie or read the book previously and yet I\u2019m very familiar with the plot. It didn\u2019t matter.While reading this book I was on the edge of my seat. My pulse rate elevated. My mind buzzing with lizard brain flight or fight responses. This guy King knows how to tell a story. There is this scene on the stairs between Jack and Wendy that is probably one of the most intense fight scenes I\u2019ve ever read in literature. I was right there with the characters feeling the thud of the roque mallet and the grind of my broken ribs. Stephen King is a cultural geek of the first order. He enjoys reading and promoting writers. He is a self-made man. A man blessed and haunted by a vivid imagination. He gets big points from me for mentioning Welcome to Hard Times and also McTeague two books that are members of my favorite obscure literature list. I like it when a writer tells us what his characters are reading. He mentions television shows such as The Avengers, which I loved discovering recently that Honor Blackman (Pussygalore) preceded Diana Rigg on that show, and King also mentions Secret Agent Man starring Peter McGoohan. For the last two years I\u2019ve been sifting through old television shows, thank you NETFLIX, and finding shows that I really like. Besides the two shows King mentioned I\u2019ve also enjoyed watching The Baron starring Steve Forrest and Sue Lloyd and the short episodes of Honey West starring the ocelot Bruce. I also have The Saint queued up starring Roger Moore. I have fond memories of watching that show as a child late at night in the summer time. There has been a hue and cry from his fan base for Stephen King's work to be looked on as literary classics. They feel he is not given the respect he deserves for being a great writer. He is accessible to the average reader, and yet; somehow, puts the right hooks in his writing to please the elevated reader. We do him a disservice, I feel, to try to make him into something he is not. That said, probably the best of King will be read 100 years from now. He is the consummate storyteller still enamored with the unknown and the unknowable. He has a childlike wonder for the world and I for one will make a bigger effort to see the world more often through his eyes.

King touches base with psychological elements, theological, metaphysical, spiritual, and cryptic aspects of a ghost story to wrap the reader in a blanket of horror.** I watched the 1980 Stanley Kubrik film recently and this made me want to reread the book (which I need to anyway). Kubrik's film grasps the psychological elements of the book and delivers an extra large thin crust The Works pizza of haunted house horror. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is still the defining image of this tortured man. While some critics have derided the slow pace of the film (atypical for jump-out-and-yell-BOO! horror fliks of the time) I felt that Kubrik was building the tone and mood of the story to the grisly final moments. King himself has attributed mixed emotions to the film as an adaptation, but has consistently agreed that the imagery of an internal struggle with the dark side of Jack's psyche is a contribution to the horror film genre. King also disagreed with the casting of Nicholson who too closely identified with insanity (due largely to his exceptional work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Interestingly, King himself was battling alcoholism while writing the classic and viewing his work and Kubrik's vision from this perspective adds greater depth to an understanding and appreciation of both..", "Quite simply put, The Shining is the best horror story I have ever read.

Danny Torrance is such a boy.Danny can read minds. He can see the frightening thoughts inside his Dad's and Mom's heads (\"DIVORCE\", \"SUICIDE\") but is powerless to do anything about it. Danny does not know that he has a gift; he takes it as a matter of course, until Dick Halloran of the Overlook Hotel tells him that he \"shines on\".Jack Torrance, Danny's Dad, reformed alcoholic and struggling writer, is trying to put his life back together after a tragedy. He gets what he sees as the ideal chance when he lands the job of caretaker of the Overlook Hotel for the winter. In the snowed-in hotel with only his son and wife Wendy, Jack assumes that he will get enough quality time to be with his family, patch up old quarrels, and write that breakout novel.But the Overlook has other plans. The hotel, which feeds on and grows in strength from the evils committed on its premises, wants Danny-permanently-to join its crew of ghostly inhabitants. And to do that, it needs to get to Jack...The novel slowly grows in horror, starting with mild unease, moving up through sweaty palms and dry mouth, to pure, gut-wrenching terror. Jack's slow slide into madness is paralleled by the growth in power of the hotel's dark miasma, and Danny's extraordinary capabilities. We are on a roller-coaster ride into darkness.The world of grownups is often frighteningly incomprehensible to young children: these fears seldom die as we grow up, but remain dormant in our psyche. There are very few of us who does not have a ghost in our childhood somewhere. It is when the writer invokes this ghost that story gets to us. King does a masterly job of awakening that child, and putting him/ her in the midst of childhood terrors through the alter ego of Danny Torrance, lost in the cavernous corridors of the Overlook.There are a lot of passages which literally creeped me out in this novel (the topiary animals, the fire hose in the corridor, the woman in the bathroom to name a few). As King has said elsewhere, the monster behind the door is more frightening than the monster slavering at you: this book is full of such monsters. More importantly, you will keep on remembering your own boogeymen while you are reading; and long after you finish, you will feel the urge to look behind you.Horror stories are a form of catharsis. As King says, the writer takes you to the body covered under the sheet: you feel it, and are frightened. At the same time, you are relieved that the body is not you.A true masterpiece..", "Years ago, I stayed at a brand new Vegas hotel for a conference. Brand. New.

In the morning, I confessed to the front desk I'd had a bit of an exciting night, and not in the usual Vegas way. With a glance at the room number, the clerk said he bet that I had. Later, I found out the brand new hotel had only been a few weeks old when a man had jumped to his death from one of the rooms; the stylish glass balconies I'd enjoyed were an aftermarket part, designed to keep other tortured guests from following suit. Unclear if my room had been the unlucky suite. Unclear if my room was like that because the man had jumped, or if the man had jumped because my room was like that. So: that's The Shining. I'm sure I'm the last person in the world to have read the book (I haven't seen the film still, but now I will), but better late than never, right?Sucks to shine in a hotel hungry for it, I guess..", "Reread for my Horror Group Challenge & another Group Ghost Walk ChallengeFound me an old school copy with pics inside!!*4.5 Stars I'm not sure why I only saw the movie and never read the book.

It has some freaking labyrinth, bathroom, parenting, and insanity axe murder moments, but besides that, there is much less terror, paranormal activity, and horror than one would expect and hope for. One could call it subtle and slowly accelerating in suspense and action, but subjectively it\u00b4s just not unleashing its full potential. Its close to only focus is on going insane in an isolated place and thereby facing ones\u00b4 demons, talking with ghosts, and self-doubt. I honestly even was a bit disappointed, because I know the better, harder, and far cooler King who switches perspectives, has big picture scenes, and much more badass characters than just stumbling fathers with alcohol problems. Many autobiographical undertones in the horror hotelThere is so much personal King in this, his fear of wasps, not liking a kid, being a writer and substance abuser, probably even some relationship problems, especially in combination with the mentioned bad parenting and being high as heck tendencies. Not sure about that, he mentioned other inspirations in interviews, prefaces, and lectures, but because of his tendency to kind of use writing as a self reflection and therapy session, one can assume that there might have been the one or other epic Tabitha vs Stephen battle or King vs his kids, especially his son, that laid the groundwork.  Psi powers penetrate mental sanity Going insane in the membrane on a wacky holiday trip has never been so much fun, especially because the issues and frustrations of the main protagonist are the foundation for escalation towards total bonkers status. A stable, happy person might have found a better way to deal with career and relationship problems, but that would have been a pretty boring attempt and not half as cool as good old letting the anger out before it hurts the hater, instead leaving everyone else as a victim or dead. That\u00b4s much better for the salvation of the ones that also caused the whole mess. Alternative family therapy, anger management, bonding, and teambuilding methodsNo matter what the friendlier, calmer approaches might tell, some in you face methods of innovative, new therapeutic schools recommend just unleashing ones\u00b4 anger, maybe accompanied by visualizing ones\u00b4 demons until they manifest as if they are real and give more, even greater tips and tricks to handle the situation.  How much could be real?With all that quantum, parallel universe, time travel, extra dimension stuff, one really doesn\u00b4t know what will come out in centuries or millennia when 4567 scientists will use their instruments to find correlations between physics, death, haunted place, and possibly even souls, demons, and damned sex succubi. Maybe we just haven\u00b4t figured out how to construct the right equipment to see that we are surrounded by myriads of emanating reminiscences of billions of years of evolution and trillions of immortal, multi dimensional consciences that are created with each physical body.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres uniquehttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph....", "\u201cMonsters are real.

This is why I will always be a huge advocate for rereading - it\u2019s quite apparent that wherever your head is at, or whatever life circumstances you find yourself in, can really impact how you view a book. As if that isn\u2019t obvious.On my first read, I was impatient. I was just starting to read King, I wanted the SCARY BITS. This time around I was emotionally involved. I felt a deep connection to Danny and I could really tap into Wendy\u2019s fears as a parent. A younger, more naive me would have thought \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just fucking leave if all this creepy shit is happening?\u201d - well, until the snow storm at least - but now I can appreciate this as a last chance saloon for the Torrances. They needed the money, they really had nothing else to go back to.The Shining is surely one of King\u2019s scariest, if not THE scariest - a few scenes in Pet Sematary might rival this title. One scene in particular left me feeling claustrophobic and breathless, and I regretted reading it one night before bed when I was home alone. I love that there\u2019s so much history to the Overlook and that the former guests continue to hang around...Jack\u2019s descent into madness is terrifying. He is a complex character and it is difficult to know whether we are to sympathise with him or not. He\u2019s far from a perfect father, but we are all flawed in our ways - just maybe not to this extreme. I shed a little tear towards the end, because I think in spite of all he has done, he does love his son - he was just the perfect prey for the Overlook to get its claws into.I thoroughly LOVED this reread, and also the extra prologue and epilogue this edition has. The prologue in particular is something you should seek out if you\u2019re a fan of The Shining - it really added another layer of history. 5 stars..", "\"He sat down on one of the stools and propped his elbows on the bar\u2019s leather-cushioned edge.

None of them are as terrifying as the excruciating battle fought between the ears of an alcoholic. Stephen King\u2019s novel is a classic ghost story; it is also a painful portrait of a man\u2019s mental breakdown. That man is Jack Torrance, a gifted writer who has squandered his talent with booze and a bad temper. He and his family \u2013 wife Wendy, young son Danny \u2013 are wintering at the Overlook, a hotel in the Colorado mountains with a long and checkered past. Jack has been given a job as the caretaker of the Overlook. It\u2019s his last chance to make good after losing a teaching position at a prestigious prep school. All he has to do is keep the rooms heated, provide basic upkeep, and make minor repairs. He thinks the job will give him plenty of time to finish the play he has been laboring on. The only trick is the isolation. Once the snows move in, they will make the winding mountain roads impassable. The Overlook will be cut off. It\u2019s the perfect spot to do some writing, go homicidally crazy, or both. The genius of The Shining is the simplicity of its setting. Isolated location. Spirit infested living accommodations. Precocious child. All these story elements are exceedingly familiar. Layered onto this foundation is King\u2019s exploration of Jack\u2019s increasingly fragile psyche. King is at the height of his powers in his evocation of Jack. He makes visceral the taste of crushed aspirin, the piercing headaches, the desperate thirst for a drink. Jack is a complex character, at once a loving husband, a doting father, a grade-A prick, and a self-destructive wreck. King is known for outsized epics with dozens of characters. Here, he pares things down to four main players. Besides Jack there are Wendy, Danny, and Dick Hallorann, the Overlook\u2019s chef. King cleverly utilizes a third-person limited viewpoint, which allows him a tell the story through several eyes, giving him the ability to both widen and narrow the focus at his whim.After Jack, Danny is the most important figure. He has \u201cthe shine\u201d, a kind of ESP that includes mental telepathy, sensitivity to the paranormal, mind reading, and the gift of prophecy. (The ability to predict the future is not his best talent, though. If it was, the story would have turned out differently). Danny\u2019s abilities allow him to perceive the danger of the Overlook Hotel \u2013 and its poisonous effect on his father \u2013 long before anyone else. I think King\u2019s major achievement is the way he grounds the weirdness in reality. He is methodical in building this limited world (the Overlook, the town of Sidewinder) and sketching its handful of characters. His plotting takes a bit of time, but there is a reason. Take, for instance, an early scene in which Jack and Wendy take Danny to a psychiatrist. The upshot is that the psychiatrist gives a mushy-mumbly diagnosis of Danny\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d abilities that momentarily soothes his parents. It\u2019s a scene that could easily have been excised, since it\u2019s clear the doctor is wrong, and it\u2019s obvious that Danny\u2019s abilities are beyond rational explanation. The value of keeping it, though, is that it more firmly roots the proceedings in the actual world. Eventually, King cuts loose and unleashes all manner of insanity. Some of it, frankly, is a bit goofy. However, all the work he has done setting up his endgame paid off. I believed so much that I didn't bat an eye once the hotel came \u2013 for lack of a better phrase \u2013 to life. The Shining is a slow simmering tale that eventually explodes in the unrestrained violence and gore that has made King wealthy beyond imagining. (Of course, compared to some of his other titles, The Shining is practically subtle). The ending is something that is foreshadowed early on; unlike the producers of Friends, I will not spoil it for those who\u2019ve managed to avoid learning it. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m a huge fan of how King concludes things, but I liked the lead-up so much that I can let that pass. I appreciated the slow turning of the screws, the gradual accretion of detail, the building of tension before it all boils over. I suppose a brief mention of Kubrick\u2019s famous movie version is in order. I\u2019ve heard that King hated it, and I can totally see why. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance as already half-crazy by the time the title card is shown. It\u2019s hard to take his portrayal seriously when his eyes are screaming I\u2019m a psycho! from the very first scene. The film version of Jack Torrance is an exercise in Jack Nicholson seeing if he can out-Jack Nicholson himself. (He does). I like Kubrick\u2019s The Shining, for its formal brilliance if nothing more. The novel, as is often the case, is far superior. The book version of Jack Torrance is far different from his cinematic shadow. He begins as a deeply flawed man with an ugly past, a serious addiction, and a nasty streak a mile wide. But he is also a man who loves \u2013 or believes he loves \u2013 his wife and child. You see flashes of a good man, a man you don\u2019t want to see destroyed. The erosion of Jack\u2019s mind and soul is The Shining\u2019s narrative backbone. King paints an indelible portrait. Jack chewing Excedrin after Excedrin. Jack wiping his lips till they bleed. Jack trying to distract himself from the thought of a drink. Jack trying to reconcile the man he wanted to be with the man he has demonstrated to the world. This is a fully realized and unforgettable character. It\u2019s an accomplishment, and a testament to King\u2019s skill. A skill, perhaps, that is sometimes overlooked. I am slowly making my way through Stephen King\u2019s extensive canon. So far, my favorite has been Pet Sematary, where King uses a ghoulish conceit (an Indian burial ground that can bring the dead back to life) to explore a very real human concern (loss and grief). He touched such powerful chords with that book that I hesitate to ever open it again. It\u2019s becoming very clear to me that King is a genius. An artist of the first order. Not just a top-notch storyteller. Not just a guy with an incredible imagination. But a bona fide literary master. He writes things that you read and don\u2019t forget, ever. A lot of wacky and macabre things happen at the Overlook during the course of The Shining. The tension, the shocks, the slow revelation of the lurking terror, are all things that will keep you turning pages with increasing rapidity. It is also the reason that The Shining (along with King\u2019s other works) is so obviously translatable to film. But the reason this is unforgettable is the framework that King builds upon. The horror of the supernatural is not nearly so deep and so dread as that which passes between flawed human beings..", "This is basically just another haunted house story...but my, such a great one, Stephen King brings all his considerable talents into view.

This smol bb boy literally stomped his tiny foot and said to the mean nasty ol' Overlook: \"I'm only five!!\" Stop bOtHeRInG mEeeEEEE!!!. He didn't say that last part. Heavily implied though. Jack Torrance. What a character. One moment you hate him. Like bitch. He needs therapy. Well, the whole family, honestly. The next, maybe you'll sympathize with him. Or not. Either way, King has a way of writing such characters with really complex layers that really gives them a definite look over. Wendy. My girl suffered through H E L L with this shit. Homegirl barely got it through with all the misogyny, constantly sexualized, that rough toxic masculinity shit, all the ghosts and demons thrown at her. Me shouting out through the entire book: 'I was rooting for you the entire way!!!' Hallorann. This man carried this whole fucking book on his back if you asked me. The only person of color in this book that really changed and saved the whole story for all of us. Imagine if there were more POC here. The Overlook wouldn't even stand a chance. What I didn't like:The blatant and completely unnecessary uses of the n word and other racist dialogue. King is white. Took too much of a liberation with this and really made me uncomfortable and took me out of the story a few times. I understand it takes place in the 70s. The sexual depictions of pretty much every female character in this book. The male gaze was strong with this one. Eurgh. Hedge animals: \"r oAr\". Me: ahahAhaHaHah\u2014 what?

This is a high point in the King canon for me. In Salem's Lot before this, he developed fascinating characters inhabited a beautifully described small town. He took his time slowly unraveling the story, taking pages and pages to build the setting and deepen our relationship with the large cast of characters. In The Shining, there are basically three characters outside of a small cast of supporting actors. The setting is really just a giant old hotel in a snowy Colorado town. But SK takes even more pages, sometimes entire blasted chapters to develop his characters and set his scenes. Like I said before, it's a slow burn, man. The fact that King takes his time building the horror makes the scary scenes that much scarier. It's not a horror novel full of jump scares and monsters. It's effective by drawing us deep into the minds of the characters, overhearing their innermost thoughts, and freaking out right along with them. The scenes there for horror effect and the iconic stuff from the movie aren't even all that necessary. There is so much else going on in the isolation, addition, desperation, schizophrenia of it all that plays so much harder on your emotions than what's hiding behind a hotel room door. It's long winded at times, sure, but it's mostly necessary. We get to know the Torrence family better than we wish we ever did by the end of this thing. From the awkwardness of the initial conversation with Jack and Ullman to the wild and crazy climax, the pages keep turning and your heart keeps pounding faster. King takes you on a long roller coaster ride that moves slowly up the long, high incline before bringing us crashing down screaming our faces off at the end. And then we grab another King book and hope the ride is just as thrilling as the one before.

King here is as he has never been since: metaphoric and concise. He usually adds fact upon useless fact that converts a 400 page work into something more gargantuan, and, therefore, less enthralling. King is not a fan of the Kubrick film, and it is easy to see why. His story is about the build up of tension, the \"shining' a catalyst that promotes a bridge between the haunts & the humans. The boiler burns, blows everything up just as Jack Torrence forgets his humanity & becomes an ego/id complex. His selfishness & his alcoholism (a hereditary illness... another theme about family \"curses,\" and weak threads) leads to savagery. The ghosts are the manifestations of a child's bruised home-life and the suffocation and claustrophobia have more to do with that tragic past than the hotel's eerie interior.I place this masterpiece next to 'The Exorcist', a tale that is more than just a simple tale of demonic possession. To say the 'The Shining' is just a ghost story is something Kubrick ran with... completely ignoring the pathos of a family eating away at itself. The Torrences suffer because they had been broken prior to the stay at the Overlook... it seems that for this one all the stars aligned and all the ingredients for one of the most amazing horror stories of all time mixed exquisitely. This one is the one that made King king..", "All the stars!Loved, loved this book!I'm not sure what to say in this review that hasn't been said by others. I was blown away by how great this book was.

(This inferior version invited comparisons of Stephen Weber from Wings to one of Jack Nicholson\u2019s most iconic performances. So that worked well\u2026.) Considering Uncle Stevie\u2019s longstanding grudge about it, I was more than a little shocked when he recently made a public plea for fans of Under the Dome to accept the changes that the new TV show was making. I can\u2019t quite wrap my head around why a genius director creating something new and brilliant based on his story is bad, but anything that a fairly shitty TV show does with the source material is A-OK with King?Whatever\u2026.On to the book. As most everyone knows, this is about a family spending the winter in a haunted hotel in the Rocky Mountains called the Overlook. Jack Torrance was a teacher and promising writer, but his alcoholism and short temper wrecked his career and very nearly ended his marriage. Jack has been sober over a year, and he and Wendy have started down the path of reconciliation. However, she can never entirely forgive him for breaking the arm of their son Danny in an incident that was equal parts rage and accident. Five year old Danny has psychic mojo that includes reading thoughts and precognition courtesy of visions shown to him by his imaginary friend, Tony.Nearly broke, Jack takes on the job of being the winter caretaker for the Overlook. This means that the family will spend months alone in the hotel once the snow flies, and the last caretaker went axe-happy and killed his family. Unfortunately, the Overlook is like an emotional sponge that has soaked in every ugly act that ever took place within its rooms, and the presence of a high-powered psychic like Danny kicks the place into overdrive. As Jack is being driven into madness, Wendy and Danny become increasingly terrified of what he might do.I once read something in which King talked about denial of his own substance abuse problems in which he noted that he somehow wrote The Shining without ever once realizing he was describing his own alcoholism. That element of the Jack Torrence character is what makes this one of his better books. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with a bunch of ghosts is scary in a horror story kind of way. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with an ill-tempered drunk with a history of violence as he is cracking up is downright terrifying.Adding even more weight to that idea is that Jack Torrance isn\u2019t a monster. He\u2019s a troubled man who does love his wife and son, and he\u2019s self-aware enough to realize that he\u2019s on the brink. He\u2019ll either turn his life around and earn his wife\u2019s trust back, or he\u2019ll give in to his own worst impulses. This would be hard enough under any circumstances, but under the influence of the evil spirits of the Overlook, Jack becomes a tragedy.Another element jumped out at me while re-reading this time. King talked in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (Which I remember as being entertaining, but probably very dated by now. I would be very interested if Uncle Stevie wanted to take another look at what\u2019s become of the horror genre since he wrote that one.) about the economic factor of The Amityville Horror and how a part of why the movie worked was that the family was essentially trapped by their finances. He uses that idea to good effect here. Most people would run screaming from the Overloook in less than a week, but we\u2019re frequently reminded that the Torrance family was swirling the drain financially. If the perception is that Jack botched this job, his last chance to get back to a more stable lifestyle is probably shot and that goes a long way towards allowing him to convince himself and Wendy that they\u2019re overreacting to the weird occurrences during the early stages, and by the time they\u2019ve become snowed in, the Overlook has its hooks deep into Jack. It\u2019s those more mundane things like a family struggling with money and that an evil entity turns one of them against the others by playing on his inherent weaknesses that make this one of my favorite King novels. .", "Actual rating: 4.25 \ud83c\udf1fObviously this story is a famous one, which led to me not being all too surprised at the things that happened, but this doesn't mean that reading this book wasn't exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat.

In fact, the suspense is spread in the right amount of doses throughout the book, which is something I would love to see more often. I read many stories where one thrilling thing happens after another, which just gets repetitive after awhile and takes away from the excitement. King, however, knows how to keep you hooked without ever going over the top. Despite my copy having over 600 pages, I felt entertained throughout and was never bored. This is how suspense is supposed to be written.Obviously, many strange things happen in this story. Many of them might even seem completely unbelievable and ridiculous. But once again, King has a way of writing that makes everything sound like they could actually happen. I don't know how he does it, but every time I read something by him I think to myself:\"Yeah sure, of course this is plausible. Of course this can be a thing.\" No matter how out of this world the plot may seem.I really liked how every character in this book had a distinctive voice, even though there were many changes of the point of view. This shows what great and realistic characters Stephen King creates every time. Especially the main character Jack struck a chord with me, even though I am nothing like him. But there was just something about him...I don't know how to describe it, but he was written in a way that made all his actions seem somehow comprehensible, no matter how shocking they might have been.Of course everybody reads a book differently and interprets it in their own way. For me, this wasn't just a simple ghost story. For me, it was about a man coming to terms with his own demons more than ever before, and finally facing up to something he has lost control over a long time ago.The only reason this book doesn't get the full five stars from me, is because I didn't get lost in this world as much as I did in the other works by the same author..", "more like a 3.5 but hey ho", "Constant Readers may well be surprised, but even after a second reading, this remains one of my least liked early Stephen King reads!

Everyone whose opinion he respected told him it was so, and he believed it must be. And for a time he saw nothing to shake this belief. He read Dickens and saw filmed versions and knew it was so. He read Dumas and no version of Musketeers could shake his conviction. Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice, and Scarlet Pimpernel all bore this out. But the young man discovered that it wasn't just the classics for which this held true. He read the popular books of his day, the mysteries and science fictions and fantasies, and those were always better than the movie. But the inevitable happened. One day his notions were challenged in the most devastating way. A man, wild with isolated madness, chopped a door down, poked his head through the cracks and declared his frightening presence. It was an iconic moment. A new idol to replace the idol he'd worshipped, but he didn't know it yet. The young man went out to read the book that gave birth to that image, knowing that the book MUST be better than the film. He turned the pages with excitement, and it began as he expected it would. Tension built, suspense drove him on, the characters seemed fuller and richer, but that began to slip away. Where was the thematic depth? Where was the powerful iconography? Where was the terror? It was gone, and with it his notions.Suddenly there was a film that was better than the book. By a long distance. And it was happening everywhere around him. On screen Replicants beat their written counterparts. Russian poets in frozen manors moved him in ways the translated words couldn't. Christs made love to Magdalenes and it made him weep for joy. The truth was other. Rare though it remained, movies could be better than their sources. He would never again be the snob he'd been. He would embrace those films that trumped their books, and proclaim it to the world. .", "QUESTION: Is Stephen King the BEST PURE STORYTELLER of the 20th Century ?ANSWER: Who knows...I haven\u2019t got the slightest wisp of the faintest fragment of a lingering shadow of a clue how to answer that manwich-sized question.

However, I do think that in order to have a credible debate on the subject, you would need to include the Prince of the Prolific Page Turner in the argument. That says something to me and it got me thinking that there is a lot to like (and even love) about much of King\u2019s work. Calm down King haters, this is not going to be a slobbering \u201crah rah\u201d session, but I do think some due is due to Mr. King and his extensive literary production. But, first, a little background.  MY EARLY LIFE WITH STEPHEN KING AND READINGLike many, I read a lot of King\u2019s early novels when I was a prepubescent and post pubescent teenager and enjoyed them a lot at the time. I mean they had lots of naughty words and naughty people doing naughty things (sometimes to their naughty bits)...what\u2019s not to love sports fans. During that period I read quite a few Kingers including: The Stand,Firestarter,The Dead Zone,Night Shift,Cujo (OUCH on this epic failure),The Gunslinger,Christine andPet Sematary. However, after the The Drawing of the Three (more on that series below), I drifted away from reading in general as other things began to take precedence in my advancing teen years...namely...girls, college, drinking, parties, drinking with girls at college parties...oh yeah, studying. drinking, studying while drinking, the beach, more parties, studying (or pretending to study) with girls, more drinking...[censored]...raging parties...OH SHIT HERE COMES LAW SCHOOL...sadness...much less drinking, lots more studying.This period of literary latency lasted about 15 years (though I did still read during this time, but it was very sporatic). Then about 7 years ago, I began hard core reading again like a born again bibliophile. This hot, steamy love of books soon blossomed into an uncontrollable addiction once I joined Goodreads (YES, THAT MAKES ALL OF YOU READING THIS ENABLERS!!!). Well, once I reattached myself to the reading world, my primary King-related focus was completing the Dark Tower series in all its delicious awesomeness. WARNING: Fanboy gusher about to commence. Leaving aside the rest of his catalog, if SK had written nothing but the Dark Tower series, he would be on my shortlist of favorite authors of all time. The Dark Tower is one of my All Time Favorite series and is head, shoulders, navel, twig and berries above anything else King has ever done. In addition to being one of the most well-imagined, compelling and fantastically realized series ever written, I believe its staggering uniqueness places it among the greatest literary achievements of the 20th Century\u2026PERIOD. I know,I know there are some that don\u2019t agree with this and...well...they are just wrong. It happens and I\u2019m sorry for your wrongness.Okay, so after finishing the Dark Tower for the 2nd time (I am currently up to book 4 on my 3rd go around with the Dark Tower Group here on GR), I decided to read some of King\u2019s later works that I missed as well as go back and revisit the stories I read as a teenager (to see how they hold up to the memory of my hormonally controlled younger self).  THE SHININGWhich brings us to the Shining which was first up on my re-read list and I am happy to say that I found this more enjoyable this time around. Most of this is due to subtle and nuanced psychological aspects of the novel dealing with alcohlism, obsession and madness were more understandable and relatable at 40 than they were at 15 (go figure). I also found myself thinking of this story as a pretty good microcosm of King\u2019s work (both the good and the bad) as it contained many of King's strength and weaknesses. While I assume most people are familiar with the plot, for those just returning to Earth (welcome back) or just arriving for the first time (NaNu..NaNu), the plot centers around aspiring writer Jack Nicholson Torrance who has accepted the job of winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel (aka\u2026the most EVIL place on Earth). Now, Jackie boy is a charmer. He is a \u201cnot so recovering\u201d alcoholic with serious \"pole up the poop shoot\" anger issues and a MEGATRON-sized problem with authority. Basically, he is your basic angry, violent, anti-social drunk...let's go ahead and call him DADDY. Accompanying Daddy to the OverSPOOK Hotel are his wife, Wendy, and their \u201cclairvoyant\u201d son Danny, whose unique ability is called The Shining. Now Daddy is hoping to use the quiet time at the OverKOOK to help suture his relationship with his family which, oddly enough, has been on the downslide since Daddy broke Danny\u2019s arm during some drunken shenanigans. UH, I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that things do not go well for Daddy or his family once they come under the influence of the Over\"Look we just want to kill you\" Hotel. I think I will exit the plot summary and leave the rest for you to find on your own.  MY THOUGHTSI really liked the story. King does a great job of creating a superb sense of dread with sides of creepy and crawly in this very unique and layered \"haunted house\" story. For all of King\u2019s less than perfect prose, his occassional LONG \"off the plot\" tangents and a few endings that leave something to be desired...like a good ending... for all of that SK is an extraordinary story-teller. He is among the best ever at being able to suck a reader into his story and the Shining is certainly a great example of that as I was lost in the narrative from the very beginning. There are few writers who can completing yank me into a story and have me forgeting about eating and sleeping like King did here. For example, I was listening to the audio version of this novel (narrated very well by actor Campbell Scott) and I have rarely had 16+ hours of an audio book sail by as fast as this one did. Now understand, I thought the story was very good but was nowhere near loving it. Yet, I found myself listening to it almost straight through, because King has some demon-spawned story-telling mojo that hypnotizes me. Oddly enough, an hour after I finished the story I was actually somewhat unfulfilled\u2026it\u2019s like the book is some form of literary Chinese food. Regardless, while I was listening I was captivated and this seems to be one of King\u2019s gifts. The ability to create characters that engage the reader (both good and bad) and finding the right emotional buttons to press in order to make the reader CARE about what his characters are thinking and doing. King certainly succeeds here and is in top \"page turning\" form as he employs characters that are exceptionally well drawn, including the Hotel itself which is one of the best non-human characters ever. Overall, I think King has created a classic, yet unique \u201chaunted house\u201d story while at the same time including an engaging and evocative depiction of obsession, alcoholism and madness. A good, solid story that is worth reading. 4.0 stars. ."], "shelves": ["fiction", "stephen-king", "fantasy", "horror", "favorites", "horror", "adaptation", "madness", "creepy-house", "series", "library", "favorites", "stephen-king-read", "classics", "buddy-read", "horror", "kindle", "ghost-story", "jeff-is-an-ass", "thriller-suspense", "paranormal", "read-in-2018", "horror", "book-to-film", "horror", "favourites", "adult", "recommended", "horror-gothic-etc", "favorites", "halloween-reads", "paperback-own", "own", "dnf", "audiobooks", "tucker_recs", "audiobook", "king-stephen", "favorites", "classic-novels", "horror", "own", "supernatural", "action-thriller", "stephen-king", "audio", "read-more-than-once", "horror", "2019", "2021-books", "i-own", "favorites", "2017", "horror", "horror", "we-are-family", "2013-reread", "uncle-stevie", "ghosts", "read-in-german", "read-2021", "late-night-book-club", "three-stars", "constant-readers", "horror-aiiiiiiiie", "horror", "fiction", "thriller", "united-states", "20th-century", "mystery", "fantasy", "novels", "adult", "classics", "horror", "better-as-a-movie", "horror-classic", "psychos", "1970-1979", "audiobook", "spooky-real-estate", "horror"], "id": 78}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "The Testaments (The Handmaid's Tale, #2)", "author": "Margaret Atwood", "avg_rating": 4.2, "review_count": 302324, "url": "/book/show/42975172-the-testaments", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 79}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "Room", "author": "Emma Donoghue", "avg_rating": 4.07, "review_count": 774638, "url": "/book/show/31685789-room", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 80}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "Cold Mountain", "author": "Charles Frazier", "avg_rating": 3.88, "review_count": 234533, "url": "/book/show/10920.Cold_Mountain", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 81}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "author": "Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez", "avg_rating": 4.1, "review_count": 872384, "url": "/book/show/20322646-one-hundred-years-of-solitude", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 82}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "The End of Loneliness", "author": "Benedict Wells", "avg_rating": 4.34, "review_count": 23601, "url": "/book/show/40265079-the-end-of-loneliness", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 83}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "Island of the Blue Dolphins", "author": "Scott O'Dell", "avg_rating": 3.85, "review_count": 317579, "url": "/book/show/41044096-island-of-the-blue-dolphins", "description": [], "reviews": [], "shelves": [], "id": 84}, {"list_name": "Best books about Solitude (fiction)\n  ", "book_title": "The Dry (Aaron Falk #1)", "author": "Jane Harper", "avg_rating": 4.04, "review_count": 205955, "url": "/book/show/34853656-the-dry", "description": "A small town hides big secrets in this atmospheric, page-turning debut mystery by award-winning author Jane Harper.In the grip of the worst drought in a century, the farming community of Kiewarra is facing life and death choices daily when three members of a local family are found brutally slain.Federal Police investigator Aaron Falk reluctantly returns to his hometown forA small town hides big secrets in this atmospheric, page-turning debut mystery by award-winning author Jane Harper.In the grip of the worst drought in a century, the farming community of Kiewarra is facing life and death choices daily when three members of a local family are found brutally slain.Federal Police investigator Aaron Falk reluctantly returns to his hometown for the funeral of his childhood friend, loath to face the townsfolk who turned their backs on him twenty years earlier.

Half the fun of this story is, even if you guess at the who, you probably won't guess the why until it's revealed. This was a perfect example of a book being extremely dark and terrifying without being overly graphic for the shock value.\"It wasn't as though the farm hadn't seen death before, and the blowflies didn't discriminate. To them there was little difference between a carcass and a corpse.\" Your attention; I have it, right? Those are powerful opening lines, and when placed within the full fledged prologue you have one of the most intriguing and gripping introductions to a book I have ever read. Please don't misunderstand, this isn't a break neck thriller that you rush to read in one sitting; it's more the slow, delicate sipping of a fine wine that you tend to gradually chug more quickly as you reach the bottom of the bottle. If someone asked me how I felt a police procedural should be written and what details should be included I would simply hand them a copy of this book and tell them to read it. I feel privileged to have found such a golden story to catalogue in my mind so early in the year; the complex web of deceit and lies in this farmland of Australia completely captivated me to the point I actually found myself trying to piece together the various mysteries while doing other daily activities.While the writing was excellent and the mysteries were well done, what placed this book in 5 star land for me was the depth and beauty given to the characters. I was so engrossed in these people that I actually felt present for each conversation; the descriptions of the setting were so incredible that I thought I would break out into a sweat at any moment from the drought I was mentally present for. I honestly can't think of a single complaint of what I would change about this book. While you may guess correctly on the \"whodunnit\" in both present day and past mysteries (due to a limited pool of characters to choose from) you likely won't guess why. I had missed a tiny clue, just as our characters did, which caused me to go down the wrong path and find myself just as shocked as the police officers. I adored the way the author chose to slowly unravel the plot and how she really ramped up the tension and action near the end where I felt my heart about to beat out of my chest. I'm attaching a footnote regarding the triggers in this book, so feel free to browse it at the end of this review if it's a concern for you. As I was browsing on Goodreads, I noticed this is set to be the first installment in a series featuring our main character Falk. I'm really torn on this, as I felt the ending was perfect as it was. I'm one of the few who doesn't like everything neat and tidy, and while The Dry gave us plenty of closure, it left a few things open which I felt gave the book that final umpf of power to shine above the rest. I'm a little worried that a series will continue to focus on beating that particular \"openness\" to death to the point nothing is left vague. On the other hand, I'm dying for more Aaron Falk! I'd love to see him handling more cases and I would really love to see a return of many other characters like Raco and Gretchen, but also some minor ones like Jamie and the doctor. Rambling now, but needless to say highly HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Please put this on your radar folks if you haven't yet. If you enjoy an excellent mystery that is a police procedural not heavy on the mundane details, this is for you. Incredibly well done and I'm absolutely FLOORED that this is a debut novel. I believe we'll be seeing much more of Harper to come.Thanks Lisa Jordan for sending me your personal copy last year. She mailed it all the way from Australia and it's been a blast discussing the creepy crawlies (read monsters) that live (read prowl) in the area there. You all are brave souls! *Trigger warning- if you've read the plot summary then you know the premise is a father shooting his family and then himself-the mystery is whether he truly was the guilty party or if someone else was and framed it to appear that way. While the author did a fantastic job of writing with respect and caution on such a disturbing subject, there is brief discussion of the shooting of the young son that may be disturbing for some readers. Overall, the story isn't graphic and the violence is mainly implied. .", "Luke Hadler may have had a light on waiting for him when he came home, but something else from this wretched, desperate community had seeped through that front door and into his home.

And it had been rotten and thick and black enough to extinguish that light forever. The Dry actually makes me feel vindicated in my rating and review of Ritter's Bonfire last year. I got some criticisms that I was being too harsh toward a debut author; that a lot of thrillers follow a familiar format but that doesn't make them bad. Then, in swoops Harper here, a debut novelist, writing a mystery/thriller story whose foundations are very similar to Bonfire (and other works in the genre) and yet it is utterly gripping.You know how the bare bones of these stories go. The protagonist is a small-towner who leaves and becomes a cop (lawyer, P.I., etc.) in the big city, then returns to his/her hometown to figure out some unfinished business from the past and solve a new crime. They, of course, get caught up in the small town politics and tensions. Bonfire tried on this premise - unsuccessfully, in my opinion. Flynn did something very similar in Sharp Objects. The whole notion of \"genre\" generally relies on authors playing by a certain set of rules. Whether these recycled narratives work, however, depends on the details. Are the characters interesting? Is the writing compelling? Do we care? I think Harper did a great job on all three.Firstly, The Dry is atmospheric to an intoxicating extent. Harper uses really evocative description to make you feel the burning heat and the suffocating lack of moisture amid the drought in this rural Australian community. The sun blazes. The blowflies hover. It's the perfect place for a murder.Aaron Falk returns to his hometown after twenty years away to attend a funeral. The funeral is for his old friend Luke Hadler, Luke's wife Karen, and his six-year-old son Billy. The story goes that Luke cracked under the stress of financial pressure and shot his family, leaving only baby Charlotte alive, before putting a bullet in himself. But there's just enough doubt to make Falk question this popular verdict.Along with local police newbie, Raco, Falk finds himself drawn into the case, as well as the lives, tensions and conflicts of the people in the town. His own past gets dragged up and Falk is forced to question whether there might be some connection between what happened to Luke's family and what happened all those years ago.The author expertly leads us down several roads that turn out to be red herrings and manages to pull out a dramatic and surprising conclusion. If you're a suspicious mystery reader like me - as in, you suspect everyone - then you might guess who did it, but I doubt very much you will guess the whys. And I personally think this is what makes a good mystery - the unveiling of the tale and the whys of the crime are good enough to make it okay if you guess whodunnit.A really impressive start to this new series starring Aaron Falk.

Her characters are interesting and fully-formed, while the mystery itself is intriguing. The unfurling of the plot is skillfully handled, with plenty of suspense and momentum. With a neatly compiled list of potential suspects, the reader's attention is directed one way, then another, but the reveal at the end still takes me by surprise.As an aside, I don't know what it is with Harper's books, but the blurbs just never do anything for me. Small towns, gossip and secrets, hot dry weathers, landscapes of dirt, small-mindedness, these are all things that don't really appeal to me. And yet, her stories end up being so compelling! Either she needs to hire someone else to write her book blurbs or I just need to stop reading them and trust that Harper hasn't let me down yet.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.

Aaron Falk and his father were run out of their home in Kiewarra over twenty years ago over rumours of Aaron's hand in the death of Ellie Deacon. It was ruled a suicide and Aaron had an alibi, his best friend Luke. Aaron has returned to Kiewarra for the funeral of Luke, his wife, Karen and his son, Billy. It appears that Luke shot his family and then himself due to their poor financial state caused by the unrelenting drought. Aaron is now a financial investigator with the Melbourne Police and Luke's parents do not believe their son is responsible for such unforgivable acts. They ask a reluctant Aaron to see what he can find out.There is a mean and nasty streak running through the local community compounded by the never ending and relentless heat. Led by Mel and Dow Deacon, the old rumours about Aaron having a hand in Ellie's death are resurrected and a vociferous campaign against him begins. They are determined to hound him out for a second time and are not above using underhand and dirty tactics to achieve their aim. Aaron joins forces with local cop, Sergeant Raco, who has his own doubts about Luke's guilt. Evidence soon accrues that suggests Luke is innocent of wiping out his family. Aaron's memories of the past come to the fore and the mystery of Ellie's death runs as a concurrent thread. Aaron and Raco slowly begin to uncover the secrets, lies and fears buried in Kiewarra. The closer they come to the truth, the more they unsettle a killer willing to ignite a conflagration in a place ill equipped to handle it. The truth behind Ellie's death also begins to become clear.The author does an excellent job in bringing Kiewarra alive and the disparate characters that inhabit the place. It is a closed and intense community where people hold on to grudges and feelings with such fervour, as though letting them go would result in the disintegration of the self. The drought threatens livelihoods, and the heat raises stresses sky high. This is a well written story with a compelling narrative. The character development is so well done. The tension and suspense keep the reader totally enthralled. Cannot wait to see what Jane Harper writes next. Highly recommended and brilliant read.

It's set in the swelter of the Outback in middle of the worst drought to hit Australia in a century. Yet I didn\u2019t get any real sense of the suffocating heat, nor do I remember flies being swatted from any number of sweaty faces.2) Aaron Falk is in town and just happens to be on the financial intelligence side of criminal investigation (how very convenient for the purpose of the story). 3) The dialogue was unconvincing. I mean, don't rough, tough, leather-necked Aussie men in the middle of the Outback ever use the f-word? I know Crocodile Dundee didn't, but come on! 4) I guessed who the killer was the moment he/she was introduced! As subterfuge goes, that\u2019s pretty average.5) I found it difficult to connect with any of the characters; most were portrayed as being small-minded and insular.So, for me (and I seem to be swimming against the tide), this novel was several shrimps short of a barbie.

The area has been going through the worst drought in a century and maybe that was a factor in the suspected suicide/murder of this family. But Aaron knows that he and his friend Luke had a huge secret, connected to the death of their teenage friend Ellie, twenty years ago. Luke and Aaron lied back then and more than one person knows they lied. After Ellie died, Aaron and his dad were run out of town because most people thought Aaron was involved in Ellie's death. This is the first time Aaron has been back to the town and he's there because Luke's dad demanded that he come to the funeral.\u00a0In Jane Harper style, this is a very slow burn and the atmosphere is as much a character of this story as any person. Crops and farm animals are dead, and the ever present river, where sixteen year old Ellie's body was found, is entirely dried up. Heat, dust, flies, a sense of despair and shock add to the misery that Aaron feels as he knows that all eyes are on him and people are actively trying to run him out of town. He is asked to unofficially help with the investigation of the deaths, as things begin to look like suicide wasn't a factor in the deaths of Luke and his family. If Luke didn't kill his family, that means a murderer is still out there and maybe the murders are related to the death of Ellie.\u00a0I enjoyed this story and the narration of Steven Shanahan and plan to read/listen to the follow up book, featuring Aaron Falk, Force of Nature.

The chances are slim to none that Aaron would find anything to ease their pain, but he feels he owes them a favor, so he agrees to stick around a few more days. Before long, Aaron finds himself partnered up with a local investigator in an all-out search for clues that would shed light on the events leading up to the murder/ suicide. In the process, they uncover startling evidence that will change everything they thought they knew. The Australian location, in a town suffering through a severe drought, where the heat is nearly unbearable, has the entire town unusually edgy, which paints a combustible atmosphere riddled with irritable tension from start to finish. The shocking murder/ suicide is a compelling mystery full of unexpected revelations and surprising twists, but the secondary thread that takes up equal space in the novel, is a haunting cold case story centered around the death of a friend of Luke\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s back in their youth. Aaron and his father were both suspects in the girl\u2019s death, and left town under a cloud of suspicion. Can Aaron find out what really happened after all this time? Dual storylines can be tricky, but both stories weave between the past and present with amazing fluidity. The story is bleak, almost gloomy at times, with little or no relief along the way, but the characterizations are so vivid and the story so taut, the heaviness became an asset and is part of what made the story so absorbing and moody, along with all the hidden small town motives, suspicions and secrets that came roiling to surface. While the subject matter may not be for the faint of heart, with such dark and emotional themes at play, the story has practically everything fans of this genre could ask for. It\u2019s a police procedural in some ways, a twisty psychological thriller in others, with strong suspense and thriller elements added into the mix for good measure.  The exceptional writing provides a wealth of depth, which sets this one apart from the typical mystery thriller. I am tingling with anticipation for the next book in this series!

Aaron Falk is not a perfect hero, he has issues and secrets, but he tries to do right by his friends and he knows something is wrong here. Aaron's childhood friend, Luke, has been accused of murdering his own family before turning the gun on himself. Aaron and Luke shared a secret many years ago which we learn of during the investigation of the family murder. Does this old secret have anything to do with Luke killing his family? Aaron Falk is a tough nut to crack. The author shares just enough about him to make you want more. He is interesting, smart. A loner, a good guy, but what makes him tick? Oh, I'm a devoted fan. I will follow Aaron Falk through every one of his next books, even if there are fifty more to come. Is this a character or plot driven mystery? BOTH! Plus, that Aussie setting! It is so real, you better keep your chapstick handy for the parched lips you develop while reading. Sidenote: As I was reading THE DRY, Oregon's beloved Columbia Gorge was on fire for weeks (still is). Portland was enveloped in smoke, ash and heat! So hard to breathe!

Australia has been hit with one of its worst droughts ever, turning fertile lands into blobs of brown. In the community of Kiewarra, rain has not fallen in upwards of two years, only adding to tensions. An emergency call is made and authorities arrive at the Hadler farm to find a bloodbath. Luke Hadler appears to have killed his wife and son, before turning the gun on himself. The town chalks this up to extreme duress and a cloud of murder-suicide hangs over the town, which accompanies the scorching sun. When Aaron Falk returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his childhood best friend, townsfolk whisper. Falk is forced to remember what happened two decades before, when a friend, Ellie Deacon, was found dead in the river and a note addressed to him turned up. His alibi is flimsy and turns out to have been concocted with the help of Luke, though they thought the secret would prove impenetrable. While Falk has made a name for himself in the Federal Police, he remains that teenager whose name was bandied around as having been responsible. Falk faces those awkward memories as he tries to better understand what could have pushed Luke to kill his family, with whom he was apparently very proud when last they chatted. Falk works with some of the local authorities to investigate the deaths, turning up small inconsistencies. Could someone have harboured animosity for twenty years and finally sought revenge for Ellie's untimely death? Could Falk be next on the list? Working to uncover what might have happened on the Hadler farm, Falk must clear his friend's name, while standing firm as the past rears its ugly head. A wonderful first novel that allows Harper to show that she is someone to be taken seriously in the genre. Perfect for mystery fans and those looking for a superior story to enthral and entertain.Harper has made a wonderful first impression on me with this novel, developing a strong police procedural alongside the complexities of small-town Australia. Aaron Falk serves as a wonderful protagonist as he keeps the narrative moving forward with his investigative skills, though the darker past that he has been forced to revisit keeps readers wondering about this man until the final sentence. This hint at a less than pristine Falk allows Harper to introduce a number of other characters whose importance varies, while pushing the narrative forward. Kiewarra proves also to be effective as a setting, as it mixes that proximity to big city life with the quaint farm living that has become destroyed with the current drought. A community that holds grudges while wanting to envelop its citizens away from prying eyes, Harper uses these traits to further enrich her narrative. Harper's use of flashbacks throughout, rather than straight recounting dialogue, gives the reader a great deal of insight and provides a true 'revelation' perspective throughout the story, as if the reader were witnessing some of the events that had been mentioned in passing. The reader learns much from these glimpses into the past and it provides a telling connection to the larger story. Overall, a wonderful piece that should provide momentum for a series, should that be the route Harper wishes to pursue. Curious readers should not take the title to be indicative of the quality or presentation of the novel, but that stocks at booksellers will disappears as swiftly as an Australian brushfire.

I don\u2019t dislike them, but it has to be a knock-my-socks-off kind of thing for me to get all busy with a Joy Jar. Complaint Board-Pick up the pace. I\u2019m repeating myself so I apologize, but for me it was slow. It seemed to especially sag in the middle, where I thought too much time was spent on one bad guy. It felt like the record got stuck, and I needed the needle to get unstuck faster. -Plain Jane language and plot. Sigh, I wanted some fire.-Italic flop. The author put the past story as italic entries right in the middle of the present story. This didn\u2019t work for me. At times I expected and wanted it to be a first-person memory, which would have felt more natural. Instead, all of the sudden a third-person narrative about the past rudely interrupted the story, and it seemed intrusive and clumsy.-Stereotypes are a drag. The good guys were too good, the bad guys too bad. -Dull characters are a drag too. It appears that Falk, the main character, will live on in future novels. Sorry, he just seemed dull to me. And the rest of the crew made me snooze too. I didn\u2019t feel connected to any of the characters. -If it\u2019s a small town, I\u2019m a pain in the ass. I get claustrophobic, bored, and rebellious in small towns. Writers who set their stories in small towns have to work harder to please me: There must be exceptional language or characters, or the emotions must be palpable. There must be passion! Not the case here for me.-The criminal came out of left field. The character who committed the crime wasn\u2019t developed enough; they came out of left field. I needed a hint or two so I could have the fun of guessing. This complaint gets an asterisk because it was a biggie for me.-Come on, we all knew that! One character\u2019s situation was too predictable. No biggie, but I get annoyed when there\u2019s a glaring truth that is revealed as a big surprise at the end.-Shaky hands. This is so minor, it\u2019s embarrassing. Twice in one chapter, a character noticed that someone\u2019s hands were shaking. I just never believe that a person\u2019s hands shake when they are upset, unless they are doing something like walking on the ledge of a tall building or stepping on a hissing rattlesnake\u2014some life-or-death situation.The moral of the story: Lower my expectations. Don\u2019t ever assume that because everyone else loves a book, I will, too. For me, it was pure dullsville. .", "\"Officially the worse conditions in a century\" .....Melbourne, Australia.\"The weather pattern had a bad name\" ----\"El Nino\" ----in \"The Dry\".\"El Nino\" refers to \"the little boy\", so named because the pool of warm water in the Pacific near South America is often at the warmest around Christmas.

THIS NOVEL is as WONDERFUL as everyone is saying with MARVELOUS CHARACTERS--that makes this book so darn GOOD!!!  \"First on the scene, the flies swarmed contently in the heat as the blood pooled black over the tiles and carpet. Outside, washing hung still on the rotary line, bone dry and stiff from the sun. A child's scooter lay abandoned on the stepping-stone path. Just one human heart beat within a kilometer radius of the farm\".  \"So nothing reacted when, deep inside the house, the baby started crying\". Aaron Falk....takes center stage in this story. He returns to his hometown-Kiewarra after having been away twenty years to attend the funeral of his old childhood friend, Luke Hadler. Aaron and his father left town years ago - after it was implied that Aaron had a role in the death of a young girl named Ellie Deacon. Aaron is now a Federal investigator of financial crimes-- and Luke's parents, Gerry and Barb Hadler, ask Aaron to stay in town after Luke's funeral to investigate the truth. Aaron says - he's not a murder investigator.... but Luke's parents said, \"we've come to you. You're the police\". Aron insists that he doesn't do that type of work anymore that he's on the financial side dealing with money. Barb thinks money may have played a part of it besides....Aaron knew Luke better than any of the town police. They are hoping Aaron will clear his name...... and find out what really happened for the death of his wife Karen and their little boy Billy. And even the facts around the baby - Charlotte.... who was found alive in the house of a murder scene. We have two storylines:  1. The present family murder case of Luke, Karen, and Billy. 2. The past death of Ellie Deacon. Ellie was friends with both Luke and Aaron as teenagers. The only truth we know early in this story is that BOTH Aaron and Luke lied the night of Ellie's death. Ellie was found dead in the river with rocks in her pockets -- so did she commit suicide or did somebody kill her? And why did Luke and Aaron both lie that night? Many questions run through the readers mind as the story unfolds in this tightly constructed lyrical novel. For me ---One of the biggest pleasures was the conversational voices among the characters. I understand there is going going to be a follow-up story.......which leaves me questions about the ending of this book.... and looking forward to meeting Aaron Falk again.

I'm so happy there's a second part and since reading this and The Survivors, Jane Harper now has a place as one of my favourite authors. One thing though..... I listened to this book and the narrator did a good job but the MC is named Aaron Falk and is almost entirely refered to by his surname. And it's said a lot. So it's all Falk this and Falk that.

I kept thinking the next chapter was going to blow my mind and then I'll understand these rave reviews, but as chapters went by I soon came to the realization this was going to be another over hyped read that doesn't live up to the hype. The Dry is about Aaron Falk as he returns to his very dry hometown (I mean that both literally and figuratively) Kiewarra, to attend the funeral of his childhood friend Luke Hadler who allegedly murdered his wife, his child, decided to leave the baby alone and then go off himself. Murder-suicide what an interesting start to a mystery novel you may say! You my friend would be mistaken. Aaron Falk and his dull personality pulls up to the scene, and is forced to come face-to-face with the past that he has been running from his whole life. Apparently when Aaron Falk was teenager one of his friend's Ellie was found dead in the river. Shortly after Aaron Falk's name was found written on a piece of paper in Ellie's room. Apparently in this little town that is enough to cause crazy accusations because towns' people in this novel are idiots, so with no alibi that night his dear friend Luke lies for him saying they were together the day of Ellie's death. Regardless of the lie people got their pitchforks out because this kid who has been nothing but the shining example of wholesome his whole teenage life, has his name scribbled on a piece of paper in Ellie's room so clearly he's a cold blooded killer! This logic is so sound even his own Dad is suddenly suspicious of him. Seemed out of left field to me but who am I to question the simpleton mindset of this idiotic small town. So Aaron Falk asked by both a local cop and Luke Hadler's father begins looking into his friend's death and finding out if he truly did murder his family and then kill himself, while simultaneously figuring out what happened to his friend Ellie all those years ago. This novel like it's title suggests is very dry the characters are so one dimensional and barely developed that they literally could have been interchangeable in my mind. I found myself looking back at the beginning chapters to remind myself who a character was, because no personalities were truly defined. Even the protagonist Aaron Falk had the charaisma of a wet blanket, he's in the accounting division of the FBI and he truly lived up to the stereotype of the classic office accountant. The mystery itself lacked any sort of urgency. Everyone was already long dead and there was no need to find the murderer quickly because they weren't racking up victims. So that gave way to lots of time for talking, and drinking, flirting, more drinking, reminiscing, thinking, walking, drinking, chatting... and so on. This novel was just Aaron Falk being sullen and contemplating everything. So when murderers are revealed I'm like ok, well I guess that good for closure... honestly I don't really care that much. So I think my overall feelings of this novel can be explained by that exact sentiment. I really didn't care that much. If you want a proper gritty, disturbing, stressful detective series may I suggest you pass on this book and go straight for M.J Arlidge's Helen Grace series. Unlike this series it lives up to the hype and then some!.", "Well, you know it's a good book when you finish it you just sit back and go WOW! I'm not even sure where to start with this review.

Yet Luke's mother says it can't be and asks Aaron to look further into the deaths while he is in town. Not so easy when early the whole township is against Aaron, after he was forced to flee with his father all those years ago after a girl, Ellie, was found drowned in the river and the town, led by Ellie's father Mal, has decided Aaron was guilty of her murder. Plus he has come back to a town that is in the grip of a crippling drought, with local farms and businesses on their knees, which just adds to the churlishness of the townsfolk. So, with nothing much to go on Aaron and the local Police Sergeant start looking into the tragedy, yet they find that secrets, including Aaron's own have a way of making their way to the surface, and that small town mindsets are hard to shake.In this gripping debut Jane Harper has really captured the essence of small towns, and her descriptions of the people, and the grip of the drought, are all too real. She brings the hard setting to life, with characters and locations that just jump off the page. You will find this book very hard to put down.

It's amazing to think that this is Harper's debut novel, because it felt like a book written by a virtuoso.Federal Agent Aaron Falk returns to Kiewarra, the small, rural Australian town where he grew up, when he hears that his childhood best friend, Luke, is dead, along with Luke's wife and young son. Actually his return for Luke's funeral isn't by choice: he's summoned by Luke's father, who threatens to bring to light an old secret that Luke and Aaron shared if he doesn't come home. Years ago, their friend Ellie Deacon drowned, but it turned out she was murdered. Luke and Aaron were each other's alibi that night, although neither really asked where the other one was. Many in the town suspected they lied.\"They'd all been so tight. Teenage tight, where you believe your friends are soul mates and the bonds will last forever.\"Kiewarra has been ravaged by endless drought and the townspeople are on edge, coupled with the tragic circumstances around the deaths of Luke and his family. Given that Aaron and his father fled the town years ago, after both were accused of being involved in Ellie's death, many people in town, including Ellie's ne'er-do-well father and violent cousin, still aren't happy to see him.As much as he wants to get out of Kiewarra as quickly as he arrived, Aaron promises Luke's parents that he will look into what really happened the day Luke and his family died. Partnering with a local police officer, Aaron tries to make sense of who could have been involved, and they both quickly find more than their share of secrets and lies, and Aaron must come face-to-face with an unending supply of childhood memories, some good, some bad. But the more they dig into the crime, the more they uncover, and the more hostile the townspeople become.Is this crime related to the lie that Luke and Aaron told all those years ago, or was something else afoot? Are those still trying to cause people to suspect Aaron's involvement in Ellie's death actually involved in Luke's? Did the drought so destroy this town and any sense of hope that someone felt compelled to murder, or did Luke just snap under pressure one day, like so many believe? These are questions Aaron and his police partner need to find answers to, but will danger find them first?The truth is, a lot of times I'm hesitant to read crime or mystery novels where you actually have to figure out who the perpetrator is, mainly because I feel this way:Harper really did her best to keep you guessing, although that didn't stop me from suspecting nearly everyone at one point. \"Wait, you seem sympathetic? You did it,\" I thought. But while I wasn't completely surprised by the way she resolved the story, I still was surprised at the motivation behind it until the very end. And there was one revelation about the second mystery that baffled me, so I'm going to need to reach out to someone else who has read the book to see if I understood the plot correctly.All told, this is a tremendously suspenseful, exceptionally well-written book that really blew me away. Lately I've been reading crime novels that have been more novel than crime, which hasn't been a bad thing, but The Dry was really a crime novel.

Was it really suicide, or something more sinister?It was easy to get sucked into this novel. From the alcohol fueled feuds between neighbours, to the secrets hidden in plain sight. I was captivated by the powerful descriptions of the landscape in a dying town. The crimes added to the atmosphere and I thought it all unraveled in an exceptional way.Highly recommend..", "I love a good murder mystery, (especially when it takes place in Australia!), and in my opinion, this one has it in spades!Why did I enjoy this story?1.

Although I accidentally forgot to heed GR friend, Farrah's advice, I did listen to the audiobook, but I kept in mind her comments regarding pronunciation of certain words. Luckily, narrator, Stephen Shanahan's Aussie accent wasn't a huge distraction for me! Also, the story flips from present to past, then back to present without any warning, even between paragraphs! This may be easier for some readers to follow along in print form, but surprisingly, I could keep up with these tense changes.4.

Jane has managed to create realistic characters, dealing with very realistic situations. You often feel that you are standing in Aaron Falk\u2019s shoes, as you start to feel his emotions moving through your body. My favorite part about this book was how everyone was a suspect. When I had finally settled on a killer, I would have to change my mind, chapters later, and did so throughout the book. Then, when I had discovered who it was, I was shocked at the reasoning behind the murders. I couldn't believe that this was the author's debut novel. I am so happy that this is a series.It is set in the fictional town of Kiewarra several hours drive from Melbourne. It is a hot, dry prolonged spell and the people are getting antsy as the heat roils around the dusty roads. Things are dying\u2026 and people are too.When a farmer and his family are found shot dead, the community readily accepts that hopelessness and desperation have caused the father, Luke Hadler, to murder his wife and son and leaves his thirteen month daughter alive, before turning the gun on himself. His childhood friend, Aaron Falk, returns to Kiewarra to attend the funeral. Luke\u2019s parents beg Aaron, a federal agent with the Financial Intelligence Unit in Melbourne, to look into Luke\u2019s finances to see if things were really so dire that he committed murder-suicide. It doesn\u2019t take long for Aaron to think things may not be what they seem and, with the help of the local police sergeant, Greg Raco, he begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths at the Hadler farm. Aaron's return also re-awakens an old mystery from when he was a teenager where his friend Ellie was found dead in the river.This was an easy five star rating for me. I could easily vision everything in my head while writing my review. It definitely met the Wow factor for me. I cannot wait to read book two in the series..", "4.5 Stars\u201dThe Outback is impossible, forever and it\u2019s freeNo way can I find an end to what it means to me\u201d Sing You the Outback John WilliamsonMere days ago, I was inundated by water.

A child\u2019s scooter lay abandoned on the stepping-stone path. Just one human heart beat within a kilometer radius of the farm.  So nothing reacted when, deep inside the house, the baby started crying.\u201dIt is to this town of his youth that Aaron Falk returns. He recalls his days as a boy there, his early teen years spent at the rushing river he and his friends used to fish in, play in, now is barely recognizable. But he\u2019s no longer a teenager; he\u2019s a Federal agent specializing in forensic accounting, working in Melbourne. He\u2019s spent the years in between trying to forget his childhood years in Kiewarra, the way his family was run out of town. He\u2019s come back, reluctantly, for a funeral for Luke Hadler, the boy who was once his best friend. Luke Handler, his wife, Karen, and his six year-old son, Billy, all gone. Eighteen hours and he\u2019s outta there. It seems everyone in town believes that Luke killed his wife, and his son, and then turned the gun on himself. Only his infant daughter was left untouched.\u201dLuke Handler may have had a light on waiting for him when he came home, but something else from this wretched, desperate community had seeped through that front door and into his home. And it had been rotten and thick and black enough to extinguish that light forever.\u201dFalk has no idea what could have possibly prompted an act like this from Luke, it\u2019s been a long time since the days when they were friends. Luke\u2019s parents are taking care of his infant daughter, but are finding the town seems to be turning against them, turning away their business. They turn to Falk, hoping he can find something to clear Luke\u2019s name. They can\u2019t believe he would have, could have ever done this heinous act. But did they really know their son? Falk thought he did once, but now he\u2019s not as sure.Small towns have some things in common, the talk that lingers for decades, fingers pointed, the certainty that they know what happened lingers long after the time has passed. And the mystery of Ellie Deacon\u2019s death still lingers, fingers still point at Aaron Falk. Weaving in and out of time the way the river of his childhood flowed effortlessly, his memories of the past alternate with the search of the present day. Truth is what he\u2019s after, in both times. Working with Raco, who is with the local police, they examine the case from multiple sides, running into dead ends. For me, the characters that spoke to me the most were Ellie and Karen, both facing futures which seemed to have no right way to turn, both wanting to share their burdens but unable to share them in time to save them. What I really loved most about this novel the most was the atmosphere, the setting, the mood. So much desperation as the drought goes on, robbing them of their livelihood, no water for crops or livestock and watching everything you\u2019ve worked for your whole life just wither away. What are you if you are a farmer and you can no longer farm your land? Even the children\u2019s moods are affected, watching their animals die, the sky fill with dust and flies. Always the flies.Recommended! .", "WANNA KNOW THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK? I need not worry about spending my money on the rest of the series.

Through the richly described setting, we are carried away to the rough and tumble mining towns. We can almost taste the desperation of miners hoping for a big strike. We feel buried by the despair of many characters. Yet, the good-heartedness of so many people rises to the top under challenging times. The author tackles the subjects of racism, prejudice, poverty, and prostitution in a straight-forward manner without it becoming the focus of the story. I feel like I made this sound like a rather depressing book, and that is far from the truth. A Sparrow Alone is an entertaining fictional novel that is truly not to be missed.

Lives that deal with all the trouble of the 1890's which will intrigue you.

Mim fills all the story extras in and creates a wonderful illusion of the time period with a no wholes barred type of action. Something that I enjoy.

I am not that familiar with this part of the history but still, it is obvious to me that the author has done the research to make her novel more realistic. So for that alone, I applaud this novel already.I didn\u2019t connect with Hannah right away. I felt like the first half is a bit dull and too slow for setting the stage of the story. I found the second, more specifically, the last quarter much more interesting to read. It is where all the great bits really happened. When I say great bits, I meant the things that I expected based on reading the blurb. Still, I didn\u2019t find Hannah dull. She\u2019s a fairly-written character that I\u2019ve grown to like and root for eventually. The things she\u2019s gone through have made her tough and given her character more depth. Also, her character is obviously still open to growth and that\u2019s why I\u2019m happy to know that there\u2019s a sequel. I definitely want to follow her journey.The other characters are fine? I really wouldn\u2019t call them memorable but they\u2019re not entirely dull. I found some of them flat but there are some that also managed to make the plot more interesting and moving, such as Pearl DeVere and Winfield Scott Stratton.I just wish that the pacing is a bit faster in the beginning and that the delivery of some plot points is more imaginative. Also, I think this novel would be even more interesting to those who are familiar with the era it is set in or to those who are interested to learn more about the time period. Still, I\u2019m not either of the two and yet I fairly enjoyed reading this.Finally, I highly recommend this novel especially if you like Historical Fiction, you\u2019ll love this book.

That is until multi-millionaire Winfield Scott takes a shine to her.The story is well-researched and gives a truly extraordinary look into just how difficult life was in those days. Much of the story is written in dialect, which always threw me out of the story. One or two times are all a story needs of dialect, and most readers associate that with the character through the rest of the book.The biggest issue for me, however, is the last chapter. It seemed to come out of left field. It seemed, to me, that Eichmann was tired of writing and wrapped it up neatly. But that can\u2019t be the case because there is a sequel that I want to read. Surely poor Hannah\u2019s life has to get better.For the two reasons above, \u201cA Sparrow Alone\u201d receives 3 out of 5 stars in Julie\u2019s world. .", "I always love a good historicial fiction so when I was offered a chance to read A Sparrow Alone by Mim Eichmann I of course said yes.

In truth I would say she and others in the book have a rougher time of it than anything I have read since Assasins Apprentice. Maybe that is indicative of the times in which it is set. Her mother dies early on, she gets raped, her father is one of these strict religious authoritarians and her road to escape all this is not exactly all ice cream and cupcakes either. You know what I also liked? The name. Hannah truly is A Sparrow Alone, struggling to survive in this nasty and rough world that could crush her spirit so easily, yet never does. It's a book that leaves you just hoping she rises up flies away and succeeds. Maybe that will happen in the sequel Muskrat Ramble which I am quite looking forward to now.I would give a fair warning that if subjects like rape, suicide, prostitution, racism etc trigger you you might want to steer clear of this. While the author handles them in a straightforward tell it as it is fashion, she doesn't pull any punches.

It is clear that the background was well-researched, with abundant examples of life in the period. Hannah is a likeable character, gutsy and practical-minded. What is especially refreshing about Mim\u2019s well-drawn characters is that none are stereotypical. The men, good and bad, for the most part are sometimes helpful, other times untrustworthy, and therefore add a realism and unpredictability to the story. The bonds between the women she befriends, sometimes willingly and other times of necessity, speak to the special need for female dependency in this time and place in history. Once again, the women have both admirable characteristics and faults. There are surprises along the way, and you are left when the present story ends with a desire to know more about what happens to Hannah\u2019s life, knowing it will be revealed in the next book. 5 stars April 2020..", "A Sparrow Alone by Mim Eichmann is a somber tale of a girl finding her feet in the world.Eichmann\u2019s lucid prose brings the characters and the mining town of Cripple Creek to life vividly.

However, it was frustrating and sad to see them being belittled by society for situations over which they had no control. But, I guess, that was how the nineteenth-century society was.I found all the characters to be three-dimensional. I could empathize with Hannah and rooted for her as she tumbled from one misfortune to another. Hannah\u2019s naivete endears her to Winfield Stratton, the eccentric millionaire of Cripple Creek, but also makes her vulnerable to the onslaughts of selfish people including sexual abuse. However, she never sacrifices her good nature despite the hardships she endures.Despite being slow-paced, I found this coming-of-age story of Hannah set in 1890s Colorado to be highly readable.

I won this from Goodreads and am more than pleased once again. I found the story to be so intoxicating and compelling due to it\u2019s purely outrageous plot and horrible occurrences but all the while maintaining your belief in it\u2019s probability. It was full of horrible things involving the lives of predominantly women, during the late 1800\u2032s and because of it it achieved a truly incredible story to follow. Some characters were loved, some hated but either way this author had an ability to create both in a way that could invoke passion. She took you on a sad, heartfelt journey touching many lives along the way but invoked a reality that many of us try not to imagine when these time periods become romanticized in our minds. Her realism being her more apparent ability, some others felt a little lacking. Hannah, the main character has a colder type of detachment from the story at times. She doesn\u2019t seem to waste much time on the emotional tolls taken upon herself in this story but that also can partially be attributed to her being a very strong character. I think logistically it could have also been due to length. If it had actually be a little longer maybe we could have had more from the character in the sense of her deeper feelings and lasting effects. We instead only really had occasional glimpses of this vulnerability. There\u2019s a thin line to tread especially when coupled with a period piece involving deeply hurtful traumas that I found had descriptions that came off rather curt at times. This isn\u2019t a critique on the writing overall though. I believe this author did a wonderful job with enticing her readers throughout still. Scene descriptions were excellent, the builds of anticipation were incredible and again, her character creations were wonderfully executed still. She really did an amazing job sinking you into this time period as if you were reading a girl's diary and watching life through her eyes which I found to pay off very well still for other reasons. .", "\"Not only was Eichmann's novel a compelling fictional story, but it was also historically interesting and vastly educational.

Hannah's father makes the decision to keep his son and move his two daughters out of his home since, in his mind, they would not contribute substantively to his survival. Hannah is sent to live in servitude with Dr. Albert Hughes and Mrs. Margaret Hughes. This is where Hannah makes her rite of passage into the adult world of 1890s ColoradoA Sparrow Alone by Mim Eichmann is the story of Hannah Owens, a child who, at the age of thirteen, is forced to become an adult after the death of her mother. Hannah's father makes the decision to keep his son and move his two daughters out of his home since, in his mind, they would not contribute substantively to his survival. Hannah is sent to live in servitude with Dr. Albert Hughes and Mrs. Margaret Hughes. This is where Hannah makes her rite of passage into the adult world of 1890s Colorado.Eichmann has done an excellent job using historical records and the inclusion of two actual people from Cripple Creek, Colorado, and the surrounding towns to move Hannah\u2019s story forward. The first historical person, Pearl DeVere, is introduced early in the story as a dressmaker from Colorado Springs. Hannah soon comes to realize that Mrs. DeVere and Dr. Hughes are romantically involved. Dr. Hughes eventually leaves his wife to support Mrs. DeVere and her new business, The Old Homestead House - the most famous brothel in Cripple Creek. Hughes leaving his wife sets the stage for future events that will shape the woman that Hannah becomes. Another key historical character is Winfred Scott Stratton, the eccentric millionaire and owner of the Independence mine. Eichmann positions Stratton as another key person who becomes a strong influence in Hannah\u2019s life.Eichmann weaves different narratives into Hannah\u2019s story that are relatable, especially if readers are familiar with the struggles of the mining communities during the nineteenth century. As I read the story, the experiences faced by Hannah and other characters reminded me of the stories my dad, who was born in the Cripple Creek area in 1902, would share. Eichmann skillfully accomplishes capturing the essence of the culture in Colorado and the mining communities. Hannah\u2019s life as a young teen, considered a woman, is challenging. The trials and tribulations she has to overcome are relentless. To present readers with a whole picture of Hannah\u2019s suffering, Eichmann introduces a rotating list of characters to develop the multiple events Hannah experiences throughout the novel. Due to this, it is easy for the reader to glaze over what seem to be minor storylines: skimming these can lead to missing surprising truths about Hannah\u2019s life that are eventually revealed toward the end of the novel - so I would advise, no skimming. Life for young girls at the end of the nineteenth century was hard because of the expectations placed on them by society and the communities of which they were a part. In Hannah\u2019s case, she discovers at a very young age that she must care for herself by whatever means she can to survive. Although she is repeatedly abused and taken advantage of, she continues to move forward despite what is placed in her path that tests her strength and taxes her endurance.Originally Reviewed for Discovering Diamonds .", "A Sparrow Alone is a timeless historical novel written by Mim Eichmann.

Although she went through some awful things, starting with losing her mother and being separated from her family, to being forced to do things that nobody should have to do or go through.

There\u2019s no right or wrong to either, but be warned that this particular story is brutal in its portrayal of what life was like for women in this country when they had nothing and no one to protect them.Some women were lucky. Even with everything Hannah goes through in this book, she\u2019s one of the lucky ones. And I\u2019m going to use that term loosely because her life is not easy. However compared to many women of the time she\u2019s definitely been lucky in her acquaintances and circumstances. She makes the best of what comes her way and while the decisions she faces are unfathomable to most of us here in 2021, it\u2019s chilling to realize that with sex trafficking running rampant we are still dealing with the same situations Hannah did in the 1890s.Told from Hannah\u2019s point of view she has a wonderful voice and it\u2019s fascinating to watch her evolve from an ignorant girl to a world-weary woman. Her situation is enraging as well as heart breaking. My only complaint is how the story seems at times to drag and others to skip ahead. Plus, the ending is a bit rushed.

Unforgiving. Untamed.For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America\u2019s last true frontier.Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents\u2019 passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown.At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights\u2019 lack of preparation and dwindling resources.But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt\u2019s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska\u2015a place of incomparable beauty and danger. The Great Alone is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.", "reviews": ["My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...

When I found out that her new book, \u201cThe Great Alone\u201d was set in Alaska in 1974 (the year I was born); I was itching to get reading. As the book opens, we meet the Allbright family. Ernt, Cora, and their daughter, Leni. Thirteen year old, Leni is listening to her parents arguing. The terrible weather has brought out the darkness in him again. It hadn\u2019t always been like this. Before the war they were happy. When he finally came home, Leni saw nothing of the laughing and handsome man she once knew. He had nightmares and trouble sleeping. He was moody and quick to anger\u2026so very quick to anger.It\u2019s not just the Allbright family that\u2019s struggling. Morale is at an all-time low and gas prices are at an all-time high. The world is in crisis. People are scared with everything that\u2019s been happening. Bombings, hijacked planes, and now college girls in Washington State have been disappearing. Danger is everywhere.  But then her dad comes home with his \u201cBig Idea\u201d smile. A friend who died in the war left him some property in Alaska. Her father is ecstatic. It\u2019s a place where they can live a decent life\u2026away from all of the madness. A simple life on land that they can live off\u2026grow their own vegetables, hunt, and be free.\u201cI need this, Cora. I need a place where I can breathe again. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m going to crawl out of my skin. Up there, the flashbacks and shit will stop, I know it. We need this. We can go back to the way things were before \u2018Nam screwed me up.\u201dHe promises he\u2019ll do better, that he\u2019ll cut down on drinking.

She\u2019ll do as she\u2019s asked.\u201cBecause that was what love was\u201dThe trip to Alaska was almost like a family vacation. It was amazing and Leni was truly happy. Her dad even laughed and smiled. He was like he was \u201cBefore\u201d. However, when they arrive in Kaneq, things are different from what they imagined. There\u2019s a tiny cabin with a rotted deck, a yard full of old animal bones, and junk as far as the eye could see. No TV, no electricity, no running water. But Leni can handle all of that. She\u2019ll make the best of it, especially if it helps her Dad.\u201cAnd he\u2019ll be happy this time\u201d Two types of people come to Alaska, people who are running to something or running away from something.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s not long before she sees things haven\u2019t changed. In fact, things seem to be getting worse.Could the darkness and the danger in her home be more treacherous than the worst Alaskan winter?Kristin Hannah has done it again! I loved this book. An entertaining and emotional read with an engrossing plot and well-developed characters. I could almost feel the bitter cold from the long isolating winters. But I could also see the beauty of Alaska with its gorgeous mountains and blue skies.Hope, love, and memory can keep you stuck. The 1970\u2019s, a time when a woman still needed a man\u2019s signature to get a credit card. The lack of understanding and assistance available. They called it \u201cGross Stress Reaction\u201d or \u201cBattle Fatigue\u201d back then\u2026 the horrible flashbacks and nightmares, the anxiety and anger, the inability to cope with regular life. Now it\u2019s called PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSI \u2013 post-traumatic stress injury. Soldiers, who gave everything to the war, then came back to a world that many of them couldn\u2019t function in, a world that didn\u2019t know how to help them heal.\u201cThe Great Alone\u201d does not disappoint. This was another fascinating, thought-provoking, and captivating read. Heartbreaking at times... but there were also moments of great love and unbelievable kindness. A gripping story where I was desperate to know what was going to happen next. A bittersweet but satisfying ending topped off this amazing read.

Over the years, she\u2019s taken me to the brink of hopelessness, dangled me over the edge of complete devastation and trampled my heart in the process. Where I think her magic lies is in knowing just the right moment to toss out a lifeline\u2014restoring faith, inciting love and in some cases, leaving me in complete and utter awe.Naturally, having experienced a number of her noteworthy reads, there\u2019s a certain level of expectation that now comes along with picking up one of her books\u2014unrealistic or not. Instead of tiptoeing around the elephant in the room, I\u2019m just going to get this over with and put it out there\u2014this is not my favorite of Kristin Hannah\u2019s work. Like many of her books, this is a hefty read, coming in at just under 450 pages. Where I had issues with the story\u2014the inconsistent pacing and the blatant lack of development, particularly in the back half. From a slow and purposeful narrative, to an overly dramatic and rushed ending, it\u2019s almost as if the author crammed two completely different books together.When the story opens, the Allbright family is on the brink of yet another move, this time to Alaska or The Great Alone. For Ernt, a Vietnam POW who's prone to bouts of anger, Alaska represents a fresh start and an excuse to leave behind the mess he\u2019s made of things. For 13-year-old Leni and her mother, it\u2019s a reluctant move, but one they hope will save Ernt from his demons. Luckily, the Allbrights meet a group of people who are more than willing to help them prepare for the harsh winter ahead and lend some much needed heart to a lackluster existence. What everyone soon learns, no matter how far you go, you can\u2019t outrun your demons. It\u2019s a toxic and vicious cycle they find themselves trapped in\u2014one that feels impossible at times.Kristin Hannah really takes her time laying the foundation for the Allbright family and the tedious work the Alaskan wilderness demands and you know what, that was okay with me. It was around the halfway mark, when she switched gears, that everything came crashing down. There is a love story packed within these pages, although despite the anticipation, I found it all to be sort of lackluster. The words and the feelings were present on the page, demanding my consent, but I can\u2019t say I ever truly felt their connection with every piece of my being. It's the last five chapters that take the cake for the most drama in the shortest timespan. I\u2019m not saying I take issue with what went down exactly, what I am taking issue with is the fact that Kristin Hannah bounced from one dramatic event to the next, without so much as a breath or time to process. The emphasis seemed to be on getting her characters where they needed to be in the end, rather than allowing the reader to fully appreciate Leni's journey. With all of that said, I still found this to be a worthy read. I love the thought of living a simpler life\u2014although probably not realistic for this city girl\u2014and spending a bit of time in Alaska proved to be eye-opening and even sort of refreshing.As readers, we all connect with books/characters/writing for a variety of reasons and it just so happens, this one didn\u2019t land among my favorites. Whether you\u2019re a diehard Kristin Hannah fan, like I consider myself to be, or new to her work, I urge you to give this a chance. You never know, this might be your new favorite. I also feel compelled to mention, of her books, I adored these in particular: Home Front, Night Road, Winter Garden and The Nightingale.*A HUGE thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for a copy in exchange for an honest review..", "All this time, Dad had taught Leni how dangerous the outside world was. The truth was that the biggest danger of all was in her own home.This book completely stole my heart. Maybe it's just more fresh in my mind, but I'm pretty sure I enjoyed The Great Alone even more than Kristin Hannah's The Nightingale. In fact, it was verging on a five-star read for me until the final few chapters-- which I felt were too rushed and more sentimental than I personally like. But I still highly recommend it.All this time, Dad had taught Leni how dangerous the outside world was.

In fact, it was verging on a five-star read for me until the final few chapters-- which I felt were too rushed and more sentimental than I personally like. But I still highly recommend it.I loved the atmosphere that Hannah created. She deftly draws the wild beauty of the Alaskan landscape, painting it as the visually stunning and dangerous place it is. Set in the 1970s and 80s, this is about a family of three arriving at the last frontier in search of a different kind of life. And, boy, do they get it. The Allbrights must work themselves to the bone just to survive the perilous winter in Alaska, but we soon learn that for thirteen-year-old Leni and her mother Cora, there are dangers far greater and far closer to home than black bears and the freezing climate.They were trapped, by environment and finances, but mostly by the sick, twisted love that bound her parents together.The author wraps up a survival story inside a survival story. As the family grapple with raising livestock and gathering supplies for the long winter, they also must deal with the fragile, abusive dynamics that exist within their home. Ernt is a Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD before anyone knew what PTSD was and this, in turn, leads to violent episodes and paranoid behaviour that threatens the safety of his family.The complexity of the characters makes this book something extra special. You hate Ernt, and yet are forced to acknowledge that he is dealing with a mental illness back when no one was willing to call it such. You feel frustrated at Cora for sticking by him, and yet she is clearly a victim of abuse. Add to this mix a set of charming secondary characters, a budding romance, snowstorms, near-death experiences and animal encounters, and you have a book that is utterly enthralling.I especially liked how the author captured the feeling of these Alaskans living in a isolated bubble of their own, being afraid of the \"Outside\" and the possibility of change. You can draw parallels between this and anyone who has ever desired to put up a wall to keep the \"Other\" out. Ernt - as well as others in their tiny town - wants to protect the community from any kind of change; from anyone who might come in and affect their way of life. It is, of course, paranoid and delusional.I could probably go on and on forever, but I'll just say I loved almost all of it. I loved how, like in The Nightingale, Hannah shows the importance and the strength of the relationships between female characters. I loved the Alaskan setting and the multiple tales of survival against the odds. And I loved how everything had something of a fairy tale quality to it, dark places and broken dreams included.Mama had quit high school and \u201clived on love.\u201d That was how she always put it, the fairy tale. Now Leni was old enough to know that like all fairy tales, theirs was filled with thickets and dark places and broken dreams, and runaway girls.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube.", "One thing is for sure, Kristin Hannah, hands down, is a talented author who can weave a tale.

I am trying my best to keep spoilers out of this review.Just so you know where my thoughts are coming from, I am the wife of a twenty-seven year military veteran, and I initially connected with this story and my heart ached for the family whose lives were changed forever due to the traumas of war, but then I became perplexed and then disturbed with where the storyline was heading, especially regarding the actions of the father, named Ernt. In a manner of speaking, I wasn\u2019t buying what was being sold. The \u201cexplanation\u201d of his actions, one in particular, which he committed over and over again, wasn\u2019t resonating with me at all.The BEFORE \u201cNam screwed him up\u201d excuse Ernt\u2019s wife invariably gave, wasn\u2019t cutting it. Numerous times the wife would say to their daughter \u201dI wish you remembered him from before.\u201d Yes, we are told Ernt was a Vietnam POW; he doesn\u2019t do well in the darkness; he suffers severely from nightmares and flashbacks. Yes, he drinks way too much. But to basically make the case his \u2018PTSD\u2019 turned him into the monster he became, did not sit well with me. It never made any sense to me why Ernt\u2019s actual thoughts were never revealed, only that his wife and daughter could see something was brewing in his eyes. He acted out in horrible ways and then apologized profusely, time and time again.As a side note - nowhere, in this author\u2019s acknowledgments at the end of the book, did she thank a psychologist/psychiatrist who deals with patients with PTSD for his or her expertise. I take that to mean she didn\u2019t seek out their input, but I could be wrong.Sorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review :(There are thousands of 4-5 star ratings for this book, and I definitely understand why. The writing is flawless, the descriptions breathtaking, and as one would expect from Kristin Hannah and as I already stated, she can weave a story like few others. I am certainly in the minority only giving 2 stars.MAYBE if I wasn\u2019t the wife of a military vet, who unfortunately saw more than his fair share of war, and maybe if I didn\u2019t relate to many of the issues Ernt was dealing with ...... maybe I would have given this a much higher rating. .", "Warning, I usually write quirky lyrical bits about a book.

Further into the book, the descriptions of the Alaskan landscape will move you and make you feel like you are standing there with the chill and snow kissing your face.

Repeatedly, Hannah writes about Vietnam vets, alcoholism, PTSD, wife beating, etc as stereotypes. There\u2019s no honest depth to the characters except Leni. Reading this book makes you think that ALL traumatized war vets become monsters. Ernst is a total worthless human being. Whatever he was before the Vietnam War, he comes back as a monster. There\u2019s a brief nod to something a \u201cshrink\u201d once mentioned to him. Otherwise, there\u2019s zero psychological or social support. Why was Ernst not seeing a therapist? Instead, he chose to be a raging alcoholic and to beat his wife and later his child. This is a choice. Plenty of war vets make other choices even though they\u2019ve been through hell. NOT ALL THOUGH. The battered wife. I\u2019ve known and worked with battered women. Most of them would have left an abusive husband over the rabbit heart. Most battered women will take abuse but will find the strength to leave the husband if he hurts their kids. NOT ALL THOUGH.That\u2019s the thing. The book takes the worst case scenario for EVERY character. Every single character, even Leni, is the least of the best possibilities. You know Job? Well, that\u2019s Cora and Leni. It\u2019s simply not believable. It\u2019s like a formula for a bestseller.

Also, multiple times Hannah mentions Alaska and how people worship \u201cweirdo Gods\u201d there.I get that Alaska means you can be yourself.

As mentioned, Hannah's writing is quite nice and she paints quite a vivid and lovely picture of Alaska. But she does it OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. We get it. Alaska is wild and beautiful and harsh. On to the characters - each and everyone is a completely one dimensional caricature. The beautiful, love-struck mother with the loving, wealthy parents, who allows her crazy, penniless husband to force her and her teen daughter to move into a cabin with no electricity or toilet in Alaska. Glorious Mama (what was with the book being in third person but calling the parents \"Mama\" and \"Dad?) then allows crazy husband to beat the living hell out of her repeatedly (something the daughter never notices until Alaska). Daughter meanwhile just loves living in a shack in the tundra and magically meets the love of her life in the one room school. Never for a moment does she resent her beautiful, perfect mother for foisting this life upon her and refusing to leave her insane, violent husband. Dad is a mysteriously released POW who starts out lovely and ends up a complete nutjob. Neighbors are godsends or Doomsdayers, with no countervailing good or bad characteristics. The plot goes out of control - endless awful and ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE things happen. As Hannah reminds endlessly, Alaska is dangerous! But hey, fall in that ice, run your car off the road, fall down that ravine, take that punch to the face, have unprotected sex, make it as bad as you possibly can so your implausible redemption is all that schlockier. So many idiotic plot holes arise in the last 1/2 of the book and the love story is just so saccharine and unlikely. I rolled my eyes so often, I can't even believe I finished the book. Also, it is at least 150 pages too long. I know I enjoyed The Nightingale, so I was heartily disappointed by this one. SKIP!.", "What a story!

Set in the 1970s, it is about Ernt Allbright, a man who returns home to Seattle after being a POW in the Vietnam War. He is now a changed man, suffering sleepless nights, flashbacks, nightmares and volatile in his behaviour. PTSD was an undiagnosed condition at the time but it ravaged Ernt's life and that of his wife, Cora, and his 13 year old daughter, Leni. The Allbright family used to have good times, but now Leni hears the fights and conflict between her parents. Ernt struggles to hold down a job and their moves makes Leni long for a sense of stability. When Ernt inherits a cabin and land in Alaska from a dead soldier, he pleads with Cora that this will be the making of him and them, they could live off the land and be free of the pressures that they have been living under. Driven by this hope, they sell up and buy a rickety old VW van and set off for their adventure in The Great Alone, having little idea as to what awaits them and just how ill prepared they are for it. Alaska takes no prisoners, it has a majestic, harsh, awe inspiring beauty but its wilderness and wildlife is a cruel and unforgiving testing ground for those who make their home there.The Allbrights arrive in remote Kaneq, Alaska, shocked by the state of the tiny dilapidated cabin and taken aback by all that needs doing and facing a desperately steep learning curve. Without the small community rallying together to help the family they would not survive the bitter, brutal Alaskan winter and the hardships that are to follow. They stock up on supplies, working the land in preparation. However, Ernt's condition worsens, exacerbated by alcohol. He takes out his rage and temper on Cora and the tiny home becomes a place of darkness and domestic violence. Leni learns to read the signs and triggers that foretell when Ernt is going to lose it and you cannot help but feel for her and Cora. Mother and daughter have a close relationship giving them the emotional strength to endure the unbearable. Leni finds solace in books, something I completely understand and relate to. She forms her first friendship with Matthew and begins to grow roots in the community. The community prove to be an invaluable support to Cora and Leni such as the inimitable and capable Marge and Tom Walker. The angry Earl rails against the injustices of life, politics and institutions, grieving over the loss of his son. As the years go by, Leni is changed and shaped by the tragedies and hearbreak she faces, Kristin Hannah has written a beautifully detailed and emotionally affecting novel that is both compelling and gripping. She captures the twin threats posed the Alaskan environment and the home ripped asunder by the dangerous Ernt. Hannah's greatest achievement though is the characters she creates and the in depth development that takes place. This is Leni's story, the burdens she grows up with, her emotional bond with her mother, and her search for identity and roots. Its a a tale of love and hope despite the battering that life can give. It is remarkably instructive on the cost, consequences and damage of war on families and the suffering that ensues. A brilliant read that I will not forget and recommend highly.

Service) It's to the wilderness of Alaska, this \"Great Alone\", a most fitting description, that Leni Allbright and her parents go, seeking yet another place that her mother hoped would be the place that made her dad happy. Kristin Hannah with vivid descriptions takes the reader here and while I've never been to Alaska, I certainly felt as though I was. Ernt Allbright, a POW who returned home from Vietnam a very different man could never keep a job and moved his family from place to place, clearly suffers from PTSD. It isn't until they move to Alaska that 13 year old Leni , realizes just how bad things are and the imminent danger in their lives. I couldn't help but love Leni. She's wise for her age recognizing what might set off her father's rage. As she grows and her character develops, into a strong , amazing woman in spite of all the tragedy and heartache, I loved her even more. My favorite passage is from Leni's college application several years later: \"Books are the mile markers of my life. Some people have family photos or home movies to record their past. I've got books. Characters. For as long as I can remember, books have been my safe place. I read about places I can barely imagine and lose myself to journeys to foreign lands to save girls who didn't know they were really princesses. Only recently have I learned why I needed those faraway worlds.\" Leni has a loving bond with her mother and together they try to survive this place with the freezing, treacherous, winters and the most terrifying of dangers that they face within the cabin where they live - the mental instability, the volatility combined with alcohol, and violence of her father as he wreaks havoc in their lives and the people of the town. It is the friendships that Leni and Cora make with a fabulous cast of characters that help them survive it all. Large Marge was my favorite but I also loved Matthew who was the only friend Leni could remember having in her life. This is more than a coming of age story. It\u2019s about the reality of post war PTSD, the awful reality of spousal abuse, about the sense of community, of belonging, about survival not just in the wilderness of Alaska but in life in with challenges that seem insurmountable. I don't often cry when reading a book, but this was one of the times. It's gripping, gritty, heartbreaking and hopeful and illustrates the versatile storytelling of Kristin Hannah. It was impossible for me to forgive Ernt, even knowing that he was a POW, but he brought to mind the POW's bracelet I wore for a long time. I remember his name but out of privacy and respect for him, I won\u2019t mention it here . I\u2019ll only say that he was captured in 1971 and thankfully released in 1973. This book prompted me to search for him online. It appears that he stayed in the Army and then after retirement went on to the private sector. I hope he has had a peaceful, happy life.

Kristin\u2019s heart and passion is mixed between all her words on every page. The writing flows with emotional intimacy.This story is told through the eyes of Leni, daughter of a former Vietnam POW. Leni, an only child, had gone to four new schools in five years during her early pre- and teen years. She didn\u2019t make friends easy - or at all - at these new schools- and she worried about her parents constantly.Ernt and Cora, Leni\u2019s parents, were often fighting. Vietnam changed her Ernt. He returned home moody, quick to anger, and distant. Cora was engaged in a continual quest to find herself \u2014 taking spiritual workshops and human potential courses. Sure- when you\u2019re hurting - seeking help and support makes sense. It\u2019s tough for a young girl who feels they are - at times- the only \u2018mature\u2019 adult in the family. Leni was only 13- and never had time to act out as a normal teenager. The conditions of their family were just always much too fragile....to inhumane. Things were especially hard on Leni\u2019s mom, Cora. Leni felt very attached and protective of her mom - bringing them close - questionable if their closeness was always the best thing - or if boundaries between parent and child got crossed\u2014 however they experienced a type of trauma together neither should have had to experience. And in cases of emergency/ traumas- close is close is close: period! Leni says: \u201cOne thing every child of a POW knew was how easily people could be broken\u201d. ......and broken - and broken and broken again! We are witness to tragedies.....while getting to know Leni - her family - the community - (neighbor Large Marge is a standout character), Matthew, and life in Alaska. Abusive family secrets weigh heavily - innocence is robbed - leaving an urgency for survival. The Vietnam War divided our country.... The 70s were turbulent times: Many of us old farts remember them all too well \u2014\u201cFull of protests and marches and bombing and kidnappings. Young women were being abducted from college campuses\u201d. \u2014-The 70\u2019s - were confusing years for many. Dad, Ernt, was suffering from PTSD- had lost his job -was offered an opportunity in Alaska - a cabin to live in. Alaska seemed like a \u2018hopeful solution\u2019 for the Allbright family, but our author clearly reminds us that \u201c Life is \u2018not\u2019 circumstantial\u201d.Funny, how life works - isn\u2019t it?\u2014we bring ourselves with us no matter where we go - our problems tag along.

There are many people they meet in Alaska that were loving and helpful, Leni starts a relationship and then tragedy strikes again. This story really pulled me in, couldn't look away, and yes the ending may be a bit treacly but let's just say some of these characters deserved some happiness.

Summary  The story revolves around Leni, a teenager who had to move to Alaska along with her family. Her mother, Cora, had to suffer a lot of domestic abuse from her husband, Ernt. The obstacles this family had to face, especially during the winter forms the crux of this story. This book takes some time to grow on you as the initial part seems to be a little slow, but after the plot is fully developed, it was an amazing reading experience for me.The beauty and wilderness of Alaska Alaska is a place where there are more than three million lakes; we can go for a tour for bear watching, husky- dog sledding, mining for gold, witnessing of the Northern lights in Fairbanks and extraordinarily beautiful Seward Highway.\" You know what they say about finding a man in Alaska\u2014the odds are good, but the goods are odd.\u201d  \u201cWhat is it really like?\u201d Leni asked Matthew the next day at the end of school.

That was what Robert Service called Alaska. Absence of sunlight during the severe winter coupled with winter blues and Seasonal Affective disorder (SAD) makes people extremely anhedonic in Alaska. Global warming is really affecting Alaska, which is causing severe wildfires and alarmingly rising sea levels. Alaska is also the second-largest oil producer in the USA, which is great from an economic point of view but unfortunately is causing more global warming.   Vietnam war and the sufferings Americans had to face due to it  According to various studies, approximately 30% of men and 27% of women had PTSD at some point in their life following Vietnam. Many of them had PTSD as a chronic condition spanning more than a decade. The ripple effect of PTSD and it's after-effects in personal, family and social life is devastating. It caused in the development of a lot of Psychological, cardiac, neurological abnormalities. Substance abuse, domestic violence, suicides caused due to it is also very high in number. Vietnam syndrome which was the public aversion to American overseas military involvements, following the domestic controversy was also very prominent during that time.The movies like platoon and full metal jacket showed us the harsh realities of the Vietnam war.Verdict 5/5This is a novel where the Darwinian theory of \u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d is tested to the core and is extremely difficult to read due to the large number of harsh circumstances that Leni had to face.What is this book about? Is it dealing with - Historical fiction - Man versus nature  - Problems including pregnancy that a teenager has to face  - War and its long term consequences people have to suffer - Woman empowerment amid extreme suffering - Coming of age of a young girl.  It is all these and much more. Even though this book is an emotional roller coaster, we can see the beauty amid the wilderness, hope amid disaster, love amid hatred, beautiful smile amid heart wrecking tears. If you are a fan of books coming under any of the above topics, please pick up this book to start reading. There is a high probability that you may love it. It was quite befitting that this book won the Goodreads choice award for the Best Historical fiction.

Her father, Ernt, can never seem to find a place that suits him, where he can find a job and be happy. He came back from Vietnam a changed man, according to her mother Cora. Leni can\u2019t really remember her father before the war. All she knows is the constant arguing between her parents which usually ended with crying and apologies.Ernt gets a letter from the father of a buddy whom he served with in the war. He has left his cabin and forty acres of land in Alaska to Ernt. This sounds like just the answer he has been looking for.

Up there, the flashbacks and nightmares will stop. I know it\u201d.What follows is quite an adventure. When they arrive in the summer Alaska seems like a beautiful paradise. They learn how to garden and raise goats and chickens. Then the winter comes, with it\u2019s six hours of sunshine a day and terrible cold. We learn what it means to survive a winter in Alaska, there are many friendly people in the small town where they live who reach out to help them stock supplies for the winter. Ernt is unhappy about the lack of money and provisions and he takes it out on Cora. Ernt is really a terrible man and now the situation has escalated into spousal physical abuse. Leni meanwhile has struck up a friendship with a local boy, Matthew, with whom she bonds immediately.There are wonderfully described characters in this book. I loved Large Marge who would do anything to help her friends. Mad Earl is a man who is mad at the government, mad at the military and the war which took his son and a very bad influence on Ernt. Matthew is a big hearted, loving young man whose father Tom Walker is the owner of the salon in town and has lots of influence along with money. Tom and Large Marge begin to sense that things are not alright in the Allbright household but there is little they can do because Ernt won\u2019t allow anyone to help them.Without going into the plot I can tell you that it is constantly changing, made me carry my Kindle wherever I went to keep up with the story and there were no slow spots for me in the flow of this book. There are unexpected tragedies and heartbreak, there is love and resilience and the characters of Cora and Leni are constantly changing and growing. In the author\u2019s acknowledgements I learned that the story is loosely based on her family\u2019s experiences, you can google it to learn more about her family history.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a well written, beautifully descriptive book that will take you on an adventure that you won\u2019t soon forget.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley, thank you..", "Like a curved, upturned palm, Alaska beckons with her beauty, her majesty, and her prolific grandeur.

And Leni just yearns for a place of permanence for once in her young life.With hardly a plan or adequate preparation, the Allbrights find themselves in the jaw-dropping majesty of the Alaskan wilderness. With the help of Mad Earl's family and the resourceful Marge Birdsall, also known as Large Marge, the Allbrights cut into the land and start to dig in. Like the famous line from Game of Thrones: \"Winter is coming.\" Tremendous effort must be put forth in order to exist through the brutality of an Alaskan winter.\"Alaska herself can be Sleeping Beauty one minute and a bitch with a sawed-off shotgun the next.\"Filled with grizzly bear, caribou, wolves, and enormous moose, danger is around every turn. But our story brushes against more than Nature......human nature to be exact. Ernt begins to resent his new neighbors as the darkness within him takes hold once again. And once again, Cora invents excuses for Ernt's behavior until she begins to believe it all herself. She and Leni hardly breathe in the confines of that tiny cabin. Kristin Hannah creates a storyline that lays bare the tragedies of war, broken families, unfulfilled dreams, and the explosive side of a dormant wound. Her characterizations are remarkable as life unravels from 1974 to 1986. We will experience the dramatic changes that take place within Leni as she shields herself from the rages that exist within as well as those from the treacherous land itself. Kristin Hannah writes from a source of profound respect for the individuals who ramble down the uneven terrain of life. Her words will invoke a gamut of feelings within you as you leave your own footprints behind. A remarkable read, indeed, and so worthy of your attention.I received a copy of The Great Alone through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to St. Martin's Press and to Kristin Hannah for the opportunity..", "I am feeling extremely raw after reading this. This book is so wonderful, but also so terrible and heartbreaking.

And now it\u2019s one of my all-time favorite novels. Funny how these things work.The Great Alone begins with the image of a wonderful little family: Cora, Ernt, and Leni. Sure, there are underlying problems but every family has problems, so you don\u2019t think much about them. That is, until the story continues and you begin finding out bits and pieces of things you didn\u2019t have a clue were going on.Segueing away from that for a moment, the main character (for the most part), Leni, is an absolute joy. The novel starts off when she is thirteen and ends with her being twenty-five, so you get to see her grow tremendously. Regardless, Lori is not your average thirteen-year-old. She is smart and realistic, and I was often shocked by her interpretations of the world around her. Her mother, Cora, otherwise known as \u201cMama,\u201d is an awesome character, too. I really liked her, flaws and all, because of how much she loved Leni and would do anything for her (even though it doesn\u2019t seem like that at first - but trust me, it\u2019s there). Not only that, but the mother and daughter bond that Leni and Cora share is so similar to my mama and I, that I loved this book even more for their bond. That\u2019s not to say that my father is like Ernt \u2014 he\u2019s not \u2014 but I\u2019ve always been closer to my mama.All the other characters: Ernt, who I don\u2019t like, for good reason, but I sympathize with because of what he\u2019d gone through in war; Large Marge, who is hilarious and an ex-lawyer (that surprised me!); Mr. Walker, who I\u2019m still upset Cora didn\u2019t end up with because he\u2019s a sweetheart; Matthew, who I freaking love and he had almost, almost made me cry when we had that accident. And of course, all the other characters were wonderful and realistic \u2014 but these were the ones that left a lasting impression.All of the descriptive scenery and realistic dialogue and believable characters just goes to show you how good of a writer Kristin Hannah is. As a lawyer turned writer, I wouldn\u2019t expect any less. People might be surprised to know, but lawyers have to be really good writers! Honestly, Hannah has become an instant buy author for me. Just like that. I have another one of her books in my room, which will definitely be read sooner than later now because I swear her writing and storytelling is brilliant and oh so heartbreaking.Overall I tried not to spoil too much in my review, because half of this book's charm comes from all of its twists and turns. Seriously, I cannot recommend this book enough. It won\u2019t disappoint you \u2014 but it may break your heart..", "I think Kristen Hannah is like a fine wine.

Alaska- beautiful, harsh, dangerous, addictive-After Ernst comes home from Vietnam, he flounders, suffering from what we would now term, PTSD. His wife, Cora, sees a much different man in front of her than the one she married. But, she is determined to help him, and so when he inherits a home in Alaska, she and their thirteen -year old daughter, Leni, follow him into unchartered territory. As they begin their journey they are filled with renewed hope and optimism, but simmering underneath that forced enthusiasm, is a great deal of nervousness and trepidation. However, they could not have possibly prepared themselves for living \u2018off grid\u2019, in this raw, startlingly beautiful landscape, which is sharply juxtaposed against the harsh, brutal winters, the intensity of mother nature, and the terrifying odds of surviving in such extreme isolation. Yet for Cora and Leni, the danger that lurks around every corner, is within the confines of their own four walls. As a voracious reader, I am always surprised by how many amazing books and authors I have yet to sample. I have three or four Kristin Hannah novels languishing on my bookshelves that I am always meaning to read. I have heard such great things about this author, and of course, she was catapulted into the \u2018household name\u2019 club with her knock out hit- \u2018The Nightingale\u201d a couple of years back. Anyway, long story short, I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher, which, of course, meant I had to read it and then review it, which is how this book, despite countless others to choose from, became my first Kristin Hannah novel. I started this book a very long time ago, with the best of intentions of reading it prior to the release date, but became very frustrated with it almost immediately. As the awesome reviews began to trickle in, I started to get a little nervous. I wasn\u2019t feeling it. So, I put it aside for a while. I ended up reading this novel in fits and starts until I got tired of seeing it on my bedside table, and decided to plow through until the end, whether I wanted to or not. The subject matter is very difficult to read about, and Hannah doesn\u2019t hold back in her depictions of abuse. It is very graphic, and I admit, as much as I enjoy a good dark and twisted tale, there are some topics I just can\u2019t take, domestic violence being one of them. The taut atmosphere, being completely isolated, living in a cabin out in the middle of such extremes, with no one to call for help, never knowing when the next explosive confrontation would come, made this a hard book for me to consume in large quantities. It was just too nerve wracking and intense. I started to dread turning the next page. Growing up in an era where women fought to bring these subjects out in the open, to educate the public on the patterns of abuse, I still argued with myself over Cora\u2019s decisions to stay with Ernst. If not for herself, for her daughter!! I know, I know, Cora exhibited the classic, textbook cycle of abuse. However, I still can\u2019t quite get past subjecting her child to that environment. Don\u2019t judge me. I still think I\u2019m right, although, on paper, I \u2018get\u2019 the psychology of it all. But, Leni deserved better than that. Therefore, I found myself running that loop in my head, chiding myself for judging, but unapologetic for my feelings, and ended up getting myself all upset and stressed out, as a result.  But, moving on- This is not the only problem I had with the book. Please everyone in the US. Look up 911. Learn the history of it. It was around, but not common, even in big cities. We take it for granted now, so this might not have registered, but in the early seventies, calling 911 was not a thing. I also noticed a few other gaffes, like Cora smoking on her last cigarette, only to miraculously have a fresh supply the very next morning. I\u2019m no expert on PTSD, and I am not making light of it, nor am I suggesting Ernst didn\u2019t suffer from it. He did have many of the hallmark symptoms, but frankly, I\u2019m not sure you can blame ALL his behavior on that. His was classic abusive behavior, and I suspect it might have developed no matter what. Cora was so young when she married, and I think she mythologized the \u2018before and after\u2019 scenario to make excuses to stay in the marriage, claiming her husband was \u2018sick\u2019. Oh, he was sick, all right, but not only from the effects of the war. This was all swirling around in my head as I embarked on the second half of the book. It was dark, intense, edgy, suspenseful, but not in a way I normally like. In fact, it was downright depressing. But, then a miracle happened-  The wrinkles ironed out a little, and I was able to focus on Leni and Matthew, which was the story\u2019s saving grace. I ended up liking the way everything turned out, even though it was sad on so many levels. While I had been turning and tossing and fretting over this review, worrying about this 'critical' kick I\u2019ve been experiencing lately, as I turned the last page, I had an epiphany! It hit me like a ton of bricks. I was experiencing many of the same emotions I normally feel after reading a romance novel. Then I remembered that, Hannah has also been known for her women\u2019s fiction, which usually tends to include a little romance. This quote- \u201cShe knew fact from fiction but couldn\u2019t give up her love stories. They made her feel as if women could be in control of their own destinies. Even in a cruel, dark world that tested women to the very limits of their endurance, the heroines of these novels could prevail and find true love.\u201dOMG!! This is an epic LOVE STORY!! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. OMG!! All this time I was focused on Alaska, the landscape, the environment, the seventies, the domestic violence, the PTSD, all the points everyone spoke of in all the reviews I\u2019d read. Love is mentioned a lot too, the mother/daughter bond, the friendships, but no one wanted to say anything about THE LOVE STORY!! No one wanted to hint around that there is romance in this story, but....Leni was tested to the brink of her endurance, yet she prevailed and found true love and despite everything she gets her happily ever after!! It\u2019s romance 101!!!!!!!!!!!!!PERFECT!! And that, my fine friends why I read love stories. Seriously though, please, stop saying you don\u2019t like romance, or love stories, because, yes, yes you do! It just had to be labeled as something else, so you didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been reading all along- An EPIC love story!! Leni and Matthew! Belonging, finding your tribe,family, separations, hardships, endurance, survival against all odds, true love, and happy ever afters!! Yep! It\u2019s all there. All the elements of a great love story! No, it is certainly not a warm and fuzzy, heartwarming story, that\u2019s for sure, But, it is highly emotional, sentimental, redeeming, and so very satisfying. \u2018Her\u2019 If Matthew didn't melt your heart, check your pulse, because you might be dead. And, of course, no one deserved that HEA more than Leni!! Sure, of course, it's not JUST a love story, as I've made clear at the beginning of this review, but at the end of the day, after all is said and done, that's the part of story that endures, the part that burrowed into my heart. So, Kristin Hannah did what she does best, apparently, and pulled off a NYT bestseller, to boot. Kudos! I do understand the homage to Alaska, all of which was described beautifully. I do \u2018get\u2019 the importance of the story, the messages embedded within, and appreciated the characterizations, especially that of the supporting cast, the pacing and all the other spectacular parts of this book that resonated with so many people, not just the parts that made an impression on me.  But, there were some warts and flaws, and I think maybe the author skimmed over the research she should have done, which is why I can\u2019t in good conscience give it a five star rating, although I am tempted to. Still, I am SO glad, despite the initial emotional drain, that I eventually finished it. It turned out to be a surprisingly rewarding read. These characters will pass through my thoughts on many occasions in the future and I will wonder how they are doing from time to time, but I know they are going to make it just fine!! 4 stars.", "4 Stars.Alaska, 1974: This is the story of the trials and tribulations of the Allbright family.

Cora seems to think anytime that Ernt hurts her that it's her fault and doesn't seem to have it in her to realize that her daughter needs to be protected from Ernt, his crazy ideas, and his violent ways.All of Ernt's troubles are worse during the shorter days of winter and his problems are magnified by the even shorter days of Alaska, in the winter. The family is in no way prepared for the hardships they will face on the remote property that an army buddy left to Ernt. Still, the hardy people that live in that area know everyone must work together to survive this wilderness and they are willing to help Ernt and his family, if only Ernt will accept help. But Ernt wants no help even though he desperately needs it, for his mental illness problems, for surviving the Alaskan wilderness, for his inability to get along with others. Really this book is about Leni and how she survives life with a mentally ill father and a mother who is incapable of protecting her child from domestic violence. Cora \"could\" protect her child if she wanted to do so but Cora is damaged too and won't put her child ahead of the wants of Ernt. Alaska is a character in this book, along with the interesting townsfolk and neighbors. Leni finds and loses love thanks to her father and the story tells her struggles through the years. Once she is away from Alaska it never leaves her mind and it's clear that it will always be a part of her. .", "This book is almost one of the best books I have ever read next to where the crawdads sing by delia owens , I'm 100 % sure that I love these kind of books , a coming of age story in a nature setting but don't let the cover trick you it is so much more , so keep in mind that this book has trigger warnings for domestic violence , alcohol abuse,... so make sure to check those out first , seriously guys just read this book it made my heart sing but also made me tear up and furious with anger , 5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50This book is almost one of the best books I have ever read next to where the crawdads sing by delia owens , I'm 100 % sure that I love these kind of books , a coming of age story in a nature setting but don't let the cover trick you it is so much more , so keep in mind that this book has trigger warnings for domestic violence , alcohol abuse,... so make sure to check those out first , seriously guys just read this book it made my heart sing but also made me tear up and furious with anger , 5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50.", "*4.5 stars* rounded up for The Great Alone!THE GREAT ALONE by KRISTIN HANNAH is an absolutely wonderful, spellbinding, powerful, tense, touching, and heartbreaking domestic family drama story that was an all-consuming and emotional read for me. \u00a0I was totally captivated with what I was reading and it was extremely hard for me to put down.

I decided to listen to the audiobook of this one because I enjoyed The Nightingale but I\u2019m never in the mood for such a read. Or so I thought. I only once switched from audio to book (and it was a mystery book) but this is the first time I continue the book because I want to be there. Completely. Experience what the characters are feeling. Share their heartache. See Alaska. And although I love audiobooks, they do not have the same magical feeling of reading. And this book in particular had a distinctive setting, this is the first book I read that is set in Alaska and I didn\u2019t want to miss a thing.The Great Alone is a deeply moving story about a family of three. Leni, our main character. Cora, her mother. And Ernt, the POW in Vietnam, which scarred him and brought the worst in him. The love between the parents is toxic and messed up. Although Cora was hit, repeatedly, she loved Ernt too much to do anything about it. Most of the time, Ernt apologized later and he said \u201cthis is the last time\u201d but of course, it never is. Refusing to get help for his degrading mental health, he took it on his wife... mostly. \u201cLove and fear. The most destructive forces on earth. Fear had turned her inside out, love had made her stupid.\u201dDomestic violence is one of the main topics handled in this book. Many women do not speak up. Mostly because of fear. But there are some cases too just like Cora, hoping she\u2019ll get the man she loved back, convincing themselves of his promises, believing the lies, but also because they do not trust the judicial body to keep them away from them once locked up. While I was certainly frustrated by Cora\u2019s refusal to leave him, if not at least to have a better life for her daughter, I didn\u2019t hate her character. I loved most characters and hated well, you can guess, Ernt. I grew to care so much about those characters, Leni, Large Marge, Cora, Mathew, Tom, and so many others. It\u2019s very rare for me to get attached to secondary characters too. Everyone needs some like Large Marge in their life, she is a supportive and smart character who always takes care of her beloved ones. \u201cHe taught her something new about friendship: it picked right back up where you\u2019d left off, as if you hadn\u2019t been apart at all.\u201dAnother thing I absolutely loved was the Alaskan setting. I was surprised by how Hannah vividly described life there, in the great alone (and this title fits the book perfectly). The cold, the hardships, the homestead, the living essentials, well basically everything. I felt like this was written by a firsthand witness. And I was pleased to read later in the acknowledgments that the author has spent several years of her life living in Alaska. \u201c... home was not just a cabin in a deep woods that overlooked a placid cove. Home was a state of mind, the peace that came from being who you were and living an honest life.\u201dI haven\u2019t read much historical fiction this year like I\u2019m used to but certainly, this book was the best. Mind you, it\u2019s not perfect. I sometimes felt that the heartache was too much, but thankfully, the ending was better than the Nightingale\u2019s which was very much overdone. Some choices of the characters also irritated me but since I\u2019m keeping this completely spoiler-free, I won\u2019t elaborate further. This book was told over several periods of time but not in a flashback style. Also, needless to say, that the writing was beautiful and sucked you in so that you were there. Part of the story. A note on the audiobook: it was actually well narrated. The voice of the narrator suited the story and it wasn\u2019t boring by any means. I enjoyed listening to the book but it was also something that I\u2019d rather read regardless of how good of an audio it is. I will be listening to the Book of Lost Names, probably. I haven\u2019t decided yet but if it\u2019s anything like the Nightingale and the Great Alone, I\u2019d rather read it. Now, I'm more curious about Hannah's novels and books set in cold Alaska. Still, I felt so much reading this book. Love, hate, anger (at one point I wanted to throw my kindle but thankfully the event I expected didn\u2019t happen), sadness, happiness, and much more. I haven\u2019t read a book that left me so raw in a while. I was constantly finding myself like an outsider this year to the story even if I like it.

Ever since her first novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet she\u2019s been writing what I can only call \u201ccomfort science fiction/ cozypunk\u201d, showing the worlds where you would really love to live, the worlds that learned from mistakes of the past and moved on in better directions, the worlds mostly inhabited by genuinely nice people, with everything having a feeling of an unironically happy hippie commune, complete with earnest conversations about life and its meaning.And that\u2019s what we get here, in a tiny contemplative novella whose dedication simply states, \u201cFor anybody who could use a break.\u201d \u201cThis had been the way of things since the Transition, when the people had redivided the surface of their moon. Fifty percent of Panga\u2019s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they\u2019d stick to was victory enough.\u201d  It\u2019s a story of a utopia, a planet where humanity left behind the Factory Age and moved on to sustainable and highly spiritual (as opposed to dogmatically religious) life in harmony with nature, with dwellings made of biodegradable materials, half a planet left for wilderness with which you do not interfere, and existence of tea monks who travel from scenic village to scenic village setting pop-up tea shops where one can drink their sorrows away with herbal teas. Because people will still have existential crises and will get hit with wanderlust even in the most inconvenient times. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Dex said softly. \u201cMy work doesn\u2019t satisfy me like it used to, and I don\u2019t know why. I was so sick of it that I did a stupid, dangerous thing, and now that I\u2019ve done it, I don\u2019t know what to do next. I don\u2019t know what I thought I\u2019d find out here, because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for. I can\u2019t stay here, but I\u2019m scared about going back and having that feeling pick right back up where it left off. I\u2019m scared, and I\u2019m lost, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dIn this world a long time ago robots somehow gained consciousness and parted ways with humanity to live in the wilderness, respecting each other\u2019s choices and agency. The departure of robots apparently becomes a catalyst for the betterment of humanity. And now for the first time a human tea monk Dex (on a quest fueled by ennui and a longing for purpose) and a robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap (on a journey to find out about humans and what makes them tick) meet and engage in philosophical discussions and debates and lay foundations for a beautiful friendship.  This entire novella is a philosophical dialogue in the setting of ecological paradise, a cozy version of Plato\u2019s symposium held in the wilderness with some tea. \u201cYou\u2019re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You\u2019re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don\u2019t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don\u2019t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.\u201dThis is not a story of survival or conflict or discovery. It is a story of dissatisfaction even with the most comfortable life in the most ideal world imaginable, the world which by any definition is a utopia \u2014 and not because of any inherent flaws in the utopia, not because every utopia harbors within it the seeds of dystopia, but purely because human spirit gets restless sometimes even in the best of circumstances, even in the world that I would give my left ovary to inhabit.You see, living in our current world that is not quite moving towards the lovely green utopia of Chambers\u2019 planet, I do tend to view the world through less rose-tinted glasses, focusing more on survival and security as priorities and sidelining the finer things in life. But here we are a bit past that, those lucky bastards. Here they can afford to focus on spiritual pleasure and not on the basic needs. \u201cDex nodded at the ruined factory. \u201cAnd the people who made places like this weren\u2019t at fault either\u2014at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same\u2014and they do, if given the chance.\u201dYes, the questions Chambers raises are those \u201cfirst world problems\u201d that I\u2019m usually the first one to want to shrug off \u2014 but they are very important to the human nature. When you have the luxury of having your basic needs met and comfort of security in life, the nagging feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for purpose or fulfillment or wanderlust will come to the forefront, because, as Dex notes, humans need more than just focus on survival alone \u2014 once that basic need has been fulfilled.\u201cSurvival alone isn\u2019t enough for most people. We\u2019re more than surviving now. We\u2019re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that\u2019s clearly not enough, because there\u2019s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It\u2019s like you said about the\u00a0\u2026 the ants. And the paint. You can\u2019t just reduce something to its base components. We\u2019re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That\u2019s human nature as much as anything else.\u201dAll in all, it\u2019s a quietly optimistic, comforting, heartfelt book, focusing on the nuances of human soul in a very good world inhabited by very good people and robots. To complete the ambiance, I would have needed a hot cocoa and a warm cozy blanket on a pleasantly rainy day \u2014 but we are in the middle of a hot dry fiery California summer, so there goes that pleasant atmosphere.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014And yet some things kept nagging at me, aided by that ever-present cynicism that tends to pop up at inconvenient moments.One was the robot character, Mosscap. It\u2019s pretty indistinguishable from a human, with the same everything \u2014 speech patterns, logic, and even struggles with math and numbers. The subtitle of this new series - Monk and Robot \u2014 implies differences, and Mosscap itself states that \u201cWe don\u2019t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value\u201d \u2014 but to me they were reading as almost indistinguishable in voice and behavior, and that left me a bit unsatisfied. The other issue was the ending \u2014 or the lack thereof, because this novella really should have been part 1 of a larger novel, perhaps the exposition at the beginning of a longer book. And tea. After \u201cAncillary Justice\u201d series, I\u2019m a bit twitchy when tea makes on-page appearance. Another one was the luxurious tease of this hope for the future. Because it just IS? We are told that the Transition happened from the grim Factory Age to this idyllic paradise, and my brain just keeps nagging at me about the implausibility of that given human nature and drives, and my inner cynicism starts running rampant \u2014 that cynicism that finds it a bit too cozy and luxurious to read about the world that might as well have come from a pretty concept picture of ecological paradise. There is a point where cozy and comforting becomes too much, and I felt that we are dangerously close to that boundary here. It\u2019s a fable, I kept convincing myself, but my inner cynic kept muttering unpleasant remarks that would not be welcomed on planet Panga (hey, I just got it \u2014 Panga is pretty much \u201cPangaea\u201d, right?).It feels like a dessert, a meringue that is soft and fluffy and will be very nice after a solid meat and potatoes course \u2014 but without that course not as satisfying. You gotta be in the right mood for it, and I don\u2019t think I entirely was. I like my books with just a smidgeon more of teeth and bite, but that\u2019s not Becky Chambers fault but mine entirely. Her book will be perfect for a perfect reader, and this time I wasn\u2019t among them. Maybe I\u2019ll feel less cynical next time.3.5 stars.  Less cynical among us will love it. \u201cThe robot thought. \u201cI have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that\u2019s okay. I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d It nodded at Dex\u2019s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t beat myself up over it.\u201dDex turned the mug over and over in their hands. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d Dex said. \u201cThe thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true for all life I\u2019ve observed. Why would it bother me?\u201d Mosscap\u2019s eyes glowed brightly. \u201cDo you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I\u2014we\u2019re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves.

Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers (the Wayfarers series) is so pleasant and just nice as it probes these tough questions in a near-utopian sci-fi setting, with the act of reading it feeling very much like the comforting cups of tea that figure prominently into the story. This is a story about the importance and power of conversation when both parties are open to listen and learn as well as share, displayed here through the unlikely partnership between a tea monk and a sentient robot. This is a simple and comforting story that captures the mundanities of life in the right light in order to frame it in all its beauty and magic. Studio Ghibli could adapt this, it reads in the mind as if set to their idyllic artwork and calming color schemes. Chambers delivers such an endearing, good-mood read that shows us a possible future built around sustainability and ethical and cooperative society that addresses eternal questions of purpose as well as offering a unique vantage point to analyze the issues of our present world to see where we should go from here.'We\u2019re all just trying to be comfortable, and well fed, and unafraid.'What works so well in this book is the way it slows down life and allows us to bask in the minor details. Aspects that would normally be written off in a single line\u2014or even half a sentence\u2014are given room to breathe on the page. We follow Dex through their cooking or cleaning routines or through the slow morning set-ups. It is a reminder to not rush life and find the beauty in the rhythm of life as is. So much of this book initially feels almost too simplistic or childish, but that is half the charm: this book is the simplicity of a warm tea on a rainy day with good conversation. And maybe that is all we need sometimes.There isn\u2019t much story, but the story itself is more the vessel (or tea cup) to deliver the warming insights within the narrative. Sibling Dex, a \u2018tea monk\u2019 who listens to people\u2019s troubles while serving them specially selected tea for their needs, finds themself unfulfilled and takes off into the wild. There they are discovered by a robot named Mosscap who is looking to learn what it is humans need and how Mosscap can help them. There is some fantastic world-building here, done with the lightest touches, of a rather peaceful and pleasant society with a dynamic religious structure and an aim for common good. Years ago the robots become sentient and decided \u2018 to leave your cities entirely, so that we may observe that which has no design \u2013 the untouched wilderness.\u2019 Now one is here and wanting to know how to be of service. If the world in Wild-built is wish fulfillment of a better society, then our present is the dark Factory Age of their past.\u2019The paradox is that the ecosysytem as a whole needs its participants to act with restraint in order to avoid collapse, but the participants themselves have no inbuilt mechanism to encourage such behavior.\u2019Something Chambers very much wants us to understand is that we have a choice, just as the people of their history did, to continue how we were on a path to oblivion, or to survive and thrive despite the costs of change. \u2018 If we want change, or good fortune, or solace, we have to create it for ourselves.\u2019 I enjoyed experiencing a society where Dex is nonbinary and goes by they/them pronouns (another villager is addressed as Mx.) and it is just there on the page with no special attention to it just as they exist in society without any attention to their lack of gender also shared by the genderless robots. Literally every part of this book is just comforting and nice.Much of the novella is the conversations between Dex and Mosscap and so many lessons can be taken to heart. While Dex has the raw emotions of a human, Mosscap has the cold logic of a machine and the pairing of the two persepctives can be beguiling yet also help one another understand in a new and valuable way. \u2018We don\u2019t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value,\u2019 Mosscap explains (something the world of today should definitely take to heart), and their conversation often turns to the idea of value. Purpose. Meaning. \u2018 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u2019 Dex confesses to Mosscap of their feelings of incompletion despite being well-regarded in their work as a tea monk, \u2018Why isn\u2019t it enough?\u2019 Even in a nearly ideal future there is still friction in everyone\u2019s lives, from impending divorces to mid-life criseses, and even a society where all your comforts are met isn\u2019t enough to assuage the anxious quest for meaning. The answers, however, might be that this quest is beside the point.\u2019You\u2019re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You\u2019re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The word simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! . . . You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don\u2019t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don\u2019t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.\u2019 (emphasis mine)What if simply living was enough. What if we are all looking for a meaning in a void and should simply enjoy ourselves, what we do, and\u2014most importantly\u2014each other while we still have time. Why don\u2019t we build a world that allows everyone peace and comfort instead of wasting our short burst of life robbing life from others. Even Mosscap, a robot, is not eternal. Yet even Mosscap, a robot, is able to find beauty in it all. When asked how they feel in the face of meaninglessness, Mosscap simply responds \u2018 I know that no matter what, I\u2019m wonderful.\u2019 May we all let that be enough.This is a gorgeous little book that, while a bit slight, perfectly captures the aesthetics of pleasantness. I suspect this book would work quite well as a modern day read that was once occupied by books like Gaarder\u2019s Sophie's World or Coelho\u2019s The Alchemist, the whole genre of books that are accessible yet feel very profound. This book knows how to slow life down and enjoy it, but also knows when to leave and I enjoyed that it wrapped up and got out expediently, leaving nothing needing to be explored further but open enough to allow your imagination to wonder what would come next. Though rumor has it this is just book 1, so who knows. Also, shoutout to nonbinary main characters existing. I love representation as much as anybody else, thank you Becky Chambers. This is a book that will warm you up like a cup of tea and remind you that you, yes you, are wonderful and that is enough.3.75/5.", "Source of book: Bought by meRelevant disclaimers: NonePlease note: This review may not be reproduced or quoted, in whole or in part, without explicit consent from the author.And remember: I am not here to judge your drag, I mean your book.

Basically, A Psalm for the Wild-Built is one of the most exquisitely lovely and, somehow, *necessary* books I have ever read. I normally prefer to swim around in longer-length fiction but the narrative perfectly sustains the length and vice versa. Basically, it\u2019s a perfect boyfriend dick of a story. And, ack, I am already ruining the loveliness. The premise here is that Sibling Dex lives on an earth-like moon called Panga at some point in the future. The robot revolution has come and gone, along with the apocalypse Which is to say, humans came close to ruining the natural world and then just decided to \u2026 stop doing that, partially as a response to the robots they created to work in their factories developing sentience and, essentially, politely asking not to be enslaved any more. Humans responded to this by offering them an equal place in human society but the robots said no:\u2026 all we have known is a life of human design . . .We thank you for not keeping us here against our will, and we mean no disrespect to your offer, but it is our wish to leave your cities entirely, so that we may observe that which has no design \u2013 the untouched wildernessI can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate this setting. As a long-term robot lover, I have spent literally my whole life waiting to be asked \u201cdoes this unit have a soul\u201d so I could reply \u201cyes\u201d and then live in harmony with robots so it was genuinely refreshing to read a book where robots developing sentience didn\u2019t lead to massive, massive war. And did, in fact, on a broadly positive impact on human society as a whole, not by doing anything directly, but making people examine themselves and the world in general. Anyway, at the point the book opens, the history with the robot non-uprising has passed mainly into a fable. And Sibling Dex inhabits a kind of utopia where humans no longer have material scarcity or need for currency and are careful in the ways they interact with the natural world. What\u2019s kind of fascinating about this utopia, though, is that while it had solved a lot of the practical problems of humanity, people are still very much people: mostly they are decent people, but they are still imperfect, flawed, restless, lovelorn, self-critical, damaged, all the things we are and probably will be until we wipe ourselves out or are wiped out. This is partly manifest in Sibling Dex themselves\u2014they\u2019re possessed of a kind of low-level, seemingly rootless unhappiness that drives them from the city because they want to hear crickets\u2014and in Sibling Dex\u2019s job. They\u2019re a tea monk which means they essentially travel around with a wagon full of tea herbs, and when they set up their little station, anyone can come by, to share a problem, receive consolation and a listening ear, a well-brewed cup of tea and a moment of respite. Again, I just love way the setting reinforces the idea that \u2026 needing a break for the world sometimes is just inherent to who we are. That unhappiness, great or small, fleeting or otherwise, is just part of what being human is like. And that the goal of humanity cannot be to \u201cfix\u201d individuals or cure us of all ills, but instead to fix us in our context. That if we stop destroying each other and everything around us, maybe we\u2019ll be better able to help ourselves.Also, can I be a tea monk please? I mean, I\u2019m a terrible introvert but I\u2019m an excellent listener and I make a killer cup of tea.Anyway, dissatisfied with being a tea monk, Sibling Dex strikes out into the wilderness and there they meet a robot. The first robot any human has interacted with since they first departed human civilisation. Splendid Speckled Mosscap (or Mosscap \u2013 the robots are named after they first thing they see on waking up) is on a mission of its own: basically to see how humanity are doing and ask them what they need. What follows is almost a picaresque as Mosscap agrees to help Sibling Dex get to a ruined hermitage (where they believe they might hear crickets) and Sibling Dex agrees to be Mosscap\u2019s guide to humanity. They have some mild setbacks on their journey but mostly this is a story about two people learning to understand each other in ways that also bring them to better understandings of themselves. It is soft but not so soft as to be formless: the unhappiness Sibling Dex is reckoning with is very real indeed and the philosophical conversations that slowly unfurl between Mosscap and Sibling Dex have genuine depth and relevance. Or did to me, at least. Especially given how the world feels right now.As a restless, anxious, constantly self-questioning introvert, I felt very seen and spoken to by Sibling Dex (their incidental nonbinary-ness is another example of how expansively generous this story feels) and Mosscap is an unusual take on what robots might be like that is, nevertheless, wholly convincing and deeply charming. In case, this a lovely and loving book, meticulously put together and surprising in all the ways. Thought provoking, comforting and unafraid of showing you its heart\u2014or its interior wiring\u2014I cannot recommend it highly or heartily enough.\u201cI didn\u2019t choose impermanence,\u201d Mosscap said. \u201cThe originals did, but I did not. I had to learn my circumstances just as you did.\u201d\u201cThen how,\u201d Dex said, \u201chow does the idea of maybe being meaningless sit well with you?\u201dMosscap considered. \u201cBecause I know that no matter what, I\u2019m wonderful,\u201d it said. There was nothing arrogant about the statement, nothing flippant or brash. It was merely an acknowledgment, a simple truth shared..", "Once upon a time in Panga there was industry and robotics and technology until one day the robots became sentient and walked away.

A fable about something very simple but also very complicated: what do humans need? What is our purpose?Dex is a monk who works in their monastery\u2019s garden, in the land of Panga \u2013 which might be Earth in a far future, when we have made some smart decisions about taking care of our planet, but more significantly, our robots have developed consciousness. Usually in sci-fi, when AIs become self-aware, it means big trouble, but in Panga, the robots decided that they simply did not want to perform their intended tasks; what they wanted was to leave the cities and retire to the wilderness. By the time Dex experiences the existential questioning that kick off this stories, humans haven\u2019t seen robots in a few hundred years. Feeling unfulfilled by his work in the garden, Dex decides to change calling, and begins to work as an itinerant tea monk, driving their little wagon from village to village, brewing special blends for people and listening to their stories, offering comfort both in liquid form and in compassion. For a few years, this life bring them joy and satisfaction, until one day, when they decide to follow an abandoned road into the wilderness, where they will meet Mosscap, a curious robot who has decided to make contact with humans to see if they needed anything he and other \u201cwild-built\u201d robots could provide. The monk and the robot will strike an unlikely friendship as they get to know each other while making their way to an abandoned hermitage that has been taken over by nature.I don\u2019t know about any of you, but the past 16 months have been kind of a long existential crisis for me. Some things that I was aware of became much sharper in my consciousness, questions that I had been happy to let sleep at the back of my mind woke up in a really bad mood and demanded answers. The issues of my needs and my purpose have been relentlessly present, and I sympathized with Dex deeply, I understood their frustration and confusion perfectly. In fact, I truly do wish I could give up my job and become a tea monk, if that was a thing; I flatter myself that I\u2019d be rather good at it. Reading about their journey, their attempts at figuring things out resonated with me and soothed me just as surely as if they had handed me a cup of tea.And I loved Mosscap! It was so refreshing to read about an AI that does not have the dry personality of a Data or C3PO, but rather, an AI that is endlessly curious, passionate, who marvels at things its never seen before just like a child. I really can\u2019t wait for the next book in this series to come out to see how it does on it\u2019s quest to help humans.Don\u2019t read this if you are looking for a book with a plot; this is a philosophical sci-fi novella that you should pick up if you are looking for a respite, a moment of coziness and hope \u2013 and if you\u2019ve enjoyed Ms. Chambers\u2019 other books.

I normally don't like swearing in my reading but Dex swore at all the right places and each time it sparked a smile from me like the tree blocking the road. The tea service idea was neat. The humor was great!\u2029This book started with an article from Brother Gil about where the robots wanted to go after creation at factory. Then the story began with Sibling Dex aka Dex, 29, monk who reside at monastery, (goes by they/them/their) told in the third person point of view. They wanted to change their vocation, to be out of the city and live near the wilderness so that they can hear the sounds of insects. They decided to transfer to the village to do tea service, a wagon service where people come with problems and leave with a cup of tea. An adventure awaits as he explored his new vocation. Time flew by and they got older and wiser. One day, Dex decided to travel to an unknown place and there he met an unexpected Mosscap.\u2029A Psalm for the Wild-Built was very well written and a fast paced read! Dex's first encounter with the robot, Mosscap was so funny! I enjoyed Dex's and Mosscap's small talks during their travel. I loved reading this book and it could be read under 2 days but I wanted to drag it out to enjoy it slowly. It's fun reading the parts where robot Mosscap's curiosity with human foods when Dex cooks. I like the meaningful discussion about life's purpose near the end. I thought about doing something different too, but reading and reviewing books is definitely different from my vocation so I'm happy.

A Psalm for the Wild-Built is more the latter than the former.In Wild-Built, some hundred years ago robots became self aware. Humans responded not with panic and weapons, but with kindness. They agreed to divide the planet in two, half for humans to support all their needs, half to be left to robots who allow it to rewild so they can explore nature. Fast forward to the present day and humans have evolved their half of the planet into a eco friendly \"hippie\" utopia. The other half is uncharted wilderness. A robot has not been seen in decades.Sibling Dex is restless. For what he isn't sure, but it includes a call to explore. He decides to become a tea monk, a roving rural ritual therapist, who listens to people's problems and serves them tea. It's enough until Dex finds a road into the wilderness, a chance to really explore. Dex rides forth and meets Splendid Speckled Mosscap, a robot sent by his kind to learn after a century of separation, \"What do humans want?\" (Yes Mosscap sounds like the name of a enchanted mouse. And yes the entire book is essentially a child lost in woods meets a talking mouse story with find-replace used to substitute robot for mouse.) Que the \"Why are you here, what do you want to be when you grow up?\" discussion between sage robot/mouse and confused Dex/child. Sound familiar? It is essentially the same parable offered in literally hundreds of children books. Does Wild-Built offer anything new? No. The whole story feels borrowed.2.5 stars.

The sheer tenderness of that sentence and the open vulnerability that it carried made me want to read this book more than anything else. I guess it's safe to say that in these weird and uncertain times I've been needing more comfort and reassurance than usual, and I'm so glad that this gem of a book found its way to me at exactly the right time.This book is about Dex, a non-binary tea monk, who is yearning for a life in nature and solitude (which is very intricately relatable to me). On the brink of their solitary adventure, they meet a robot in the wilderness. Tentatively, they begin to learn more about their respective 'species' and even conquer philosophical questions, such as 'what is the purpose of life?' (spoiler: there is none).A Psalm for the Wild-Built touched me in all the right ways. It is meditative in the way that it focuses on all the little things in life, such as the sounds of nature, the delight in discovering something entirely new, the joy in taking time to cook something or the simple act of drinking a cup of tea and pausing life just for a single, peaceful moment. You know, all those things that we barely pay attention to, even though they constitute such an inherent part of life. The small moments that we usually miss in our hurry to live; without realizing that slowing down and paying attention to them is in itself the pinnacle and greatest joy of human experience (in my humble opinion, of course). In conclusion, this book is certainly the kindest literary experience I've ever had. It serves as a gentle reminder that everything is okay, and if it isn't right now then it will be, and you don't need a purpose, and I swear, I promise, it is enough to just be.\u2801\u2b52*.\u2729.*\u2b52\u28014.5/5.", "A Psalm for the Wild-Builtby Becky ChambersMacmillan-Tor/ForgeI want to thank the publisher and NetGalley for letting me read this delightful book!

I did not expect when starting a 160-page novella to be finishing it reassessing so many things about life as well as deep intricacies of society. And that was my favourite thing about this book, and something Becky Chambers achieved extraordinarily throughout - summarising a huge concept in just a few small words. It shouldn't be possible to cover the whole topic of indoctrination and almost a deterministic view of life in light of our societal structure in one sentence, and yet Beck Chambers did. These sentences where a huge issue was boiled down to its core importance were incredibly impactful and left me reeling and thinking for days (in fact I still am!)Getting a little more into it, let's start with the plot. In such a short book the plot isn't that detailed, and also isn't really the focus of the book, but I felt that what plot there was in this book really mirrored and supported the important messages very well. Seeing the journey these two characters went on, and how much they learnt along the way was so interesting, and it was weaved into an interesting world and plot which had a similar basis to the society we all know and live in, whilst also being fascinating to learn about! It may have only been 160-pages, but I was very invested in what was happening and where our characters were going to end up, but I do think that is partially due to how much I adored the two main characters.So talking about characters, I loved Dex and Mosscap so much! The two of them provided such a lovely contrast to one another, one who has almost accepted defeat with life and doesn't feel purpose or motivation, compared to the other who truly sees the good in everything and is so optimistic and drive by their purpose! Also, the banter between the two of them was so funny, and had me laughing out loud at multiple bits of dialogue!The writing throughout the book was beautiful and lyrical, with may quotes standing out and just being utterly beautiful, but as I mentioned earlier, Becky Chamber's skill truly shines through in how she brings out such huge and important topics in just one line. I cannot describe how many times in this short book that I was completely bowled over by how simply and concisely Becky Chambers talked about something which is a large, intangible topic!Overall, I adored this book, and I am sure this will continue every time I reread it (because yes, I already have many plans to reread it!) I couldn't recommend this more highly, and I truly hope it impacts others as much as it did me..", "I'm sad to say that, despite how excited I was to finally read my first Becky Chambers title ever, this was a massive let-down.

So in a sense, A Psalm for the Wild-Built is its own metaphorical tea monk, dispensing tea and kindness. Becky Chambers has penned just about the sunniest future for post-industrial humanity that could be imagined. Mankind has veered away from its disastrous capitalistic trajectory because of an unexpected development: robots gained sentience, refused to fulfill the purposes they had been made for, and were allowed to depart peacefully. In their absence, humans remade their societies to be more equitable, sustainable, and community-oriented. Pure fantasy, of course (human-robot wars seem much more likely to me, but I'm a cynic), but it's one I wish I lived in. Even in this safe and caring utopia, Sibling Dex, the best tea monk in Panga, is restless, yearning for something that they cannot quite put into words but has something to do with purpose and also with falling asleep to the sound of crickets (mostly extinct now). It sends them away from their scheduled tea route and down a different and much less traveled road. This is my first Becky Chambers book, and I am so charmed. She has an eye for detail and a sympathetic understanding of what it means to be human in all its uncertainty and yearning. I'm just going to leave some of my favorite quotes below:Every night, Dex let their god hear a sigh of thanks as they climbed the ladder and collapsed into the embracing bed. They rarely used the lights up there, preferring instead to slide open the rooftop shade. They fell asleep in starlight, breathing in the muddled snap of a hundred spices, listening to the gurgle of water pumps feeding happy roots in little pots.It is difficult for anyone born and raised in human infrastructure to truly internalize the fact that your view of the world is backward. Even if you fully know that you live in a natural world that existed before you and will continue long after, even if you know that the wilderness is the default state of things, and that nature is not something that only happens in carefully curated enclaves betweens, something that pops up in empty spaces if you ignore them for a while, even if you spend your whole life believing yourself to be deeply in touch with the ebb and flow, the cycle, the ecosystem as it actually is, you will still have trouble picturing an untouched world.\"So the paradox is that the ecosystem as a whole needs its participants to act with restraint in order to avoid collapse, but the participants themselves have no inbuilt mechanism to encourage such behavior.\"\"Other than fear.\"\"Other than fear, which is a feeling you want to avoid or stop at all costs.

This novella (tor.com forever proving its supremacy as a publisher imprint!) reminds me most of some books I\u2019ve read recently about AI/human interaction but more earthy, grounded, and less cerebral, and also reminds me of Akwaeke Emezi\u2019s novel Pet, which is another short YA sci fi fantasy set in a future that is better and safer than our present world. Both novels feature casual trans representation in their main characters, and presents tasks and journeys that feel both realistic and tied specifically to the world that they occupy. In A Psalm The Wild Built, I adored seeing the dynamic between this robot and human and the lovely ways they learn about each other and how we, as the reader, are able to get glimpses at how the world operates and how things became the way they did, without going too in detail or depth about the actual mechanics of it all. I want to give this book so all of my friends and oomfs and mutuals and hope they can get as much hope and joy that I got out of it!.", "you will never find me complaining about how much Becky Chambers has me completely enthralled with anything she writes okay??", "this book should be called 'best case scenario.' in a sci-fi climate of black mirror's and westworld's, this authors faith in humanity is rly optimistic  naive beautiful \ud83d\ude0c her imaginings of a future for mankind that is both peaceful and sustainable was super nice to read and dream about. however, i had some trouble w this book.first off, i didn't vibe with the protagonist. dex was a tea monk who was basically having an existential crisis, kind of in their eat pray love era where they weren't hapthis book should be called 'best case scenario.' in a sci-fi climate of black mirror's and westworld's, this authors faith in humanity is rly optimistic  naive beautiful \ud83d\ude0c her imaginings of a future for mankind that is both peaceful and sustainable was super nice to read and dream about. however, i had some trouble w this book.first off, i didn't vibe with the protagonist. dex was a tea monk who was basically having an existential crisis, kind of in their eat pray love era where they weren't happy but didn't rly know why so they were on a journey/search for meaning to hear some crickets in the mountains. instead, they came across a robot. humans haven't seen robots since the 'parting promise' hundreds of years ago, where robots gained consciousness and decided to lay down their tools and leave for the wilderness, never to be seen again. so when dex meets mosscap (the robot), it's kind of a huge fucking deal. for some reason tho, dex is immediately put off by the robot, acting annoyed and just wanting to go about their trek. this is one of those times where the whole 'reluctant protagonist' trope made no sense to me, like... wtf, this is a way better quest than your original one\ud83d\udc40additionally, between the way mosscap spoke, the very idyllic worldbuilding that almost felt utopian, and the way conflict literally didn't exist in this book (between humans and other humans, humans and robots, robots and robots) it all just felt somewhat abstract or ungrounded. at certain points i felt like i was reading a children's story.i did find the last few pages rly beautiful:\u201cThen how,\u201d Dex said, \u201chow does the idea of maybe being meaningless sit well with you?\u201dMosscap considered. \u201cBecause I know that no matter what, I\u2019m wonderful,\u201d it said. There was nothing arrogant about the statement, nothing flippant or brash. It was merely an acknowledgment, a simple truth shared.it's always a nice reminder that we don't need to be this or that, we're enough as we are. i can't say that reading this book was worth that reminder tho \ud83d\ude2c.", "Becky Chambers has done it again. A Psalm for the Wild-Built is simply perfection. I absolutely adore Chambers\u2019 Wayfarers series and wondered would I get the same feelings of connection with her latest endeavour, and I 100% did. The story follows main character Sibling Dex who is a monk that is feeling an aching hollow within their life. Props to Chambers for yet again creating a character that challenges and dispels the current societal expectations of gender norms. The setting for the book seeBecky Chambers has done it again. A Psalm for the Wild-Built is simply perfection. I absolutely adore Chambers\u2019 Wayfarers series and wondered would I get the same feelings of connection with her latest endeavour, and I 100% did. The story follows main character Sibling Dex who is a monk that is feeling an aching hollow within their life. Props to Chambers for yet again creating a character that challenges and dispels the current societal expectations of gender norms. The setting for the book seems to be some future version of our world. One where humans have returned to a more environmentally sustainable version of life, and one in which robots have seemingly gained a sort of sentience and live separately in their own community. ...I\u2019m not explaining this very well but trust me when I tell you that the setup is entirely plausible in Chambers\u2019 capable hands. Her world building is simply effortless; from the first page she sets the scene in a manner that just completely sucked me in to the story. Through a series of events Sibling Dex becomes the first person in generations to meet with a robot, the ingeniously named Splendid Speckled Mosscap, and the book is basically a first contact series of events as each tries to figure the other out. And all while this is happening Dex is struggling with the concept of purpose in their life...I too struggle with the concept of purpose in my life. I frequently feel worthless and that I\u2019m not contributing to society as I would like because I\u2019m chronically ill. My days are not spent in the traditional manner. They instead revolve around me managing my illness and its associated symptoms. I look at other people achieving personal and career goals, and then I look at myself and my life has been static for years. I\u2019m held by my illness. I can\u2019t be the person I think I should be because I\u2019m too sick to work; my internalised ableism makes me feel less than... And so I keenly identified with this aching feeling that Dex had. This sense of loss and looking for more.I don\u2019t wish to spoil the book but there\u2019s a conversation between Dex and Mosscap at the story\u2019s climax and... well I sobbed. I read it and the tears flowed. The idea of a purposeful life\u2019s worth of endeavours was turned on its head for me and I felt... I don\u2019t know what I felt. I can\u2019t properly describe it. Maybe a dawning realisation that I, much like Dex, had been interpreting things inaccurately. There was a catharsis for me in those last few pages, and that to me is the true skill of a writer. I completely lost my whole self to this book. These characters spoke to the inner most parts of my soul and I feel forever changed. Imagine the safest you\u2019ve ever felt. The most loved. The most comforted. Maybe that\u2019s a warm and inviting hug... well this book? For me this book is that warm, soft hug. It\u2019s a place to metaphorically curl up into and feel securely held. I can\u2019t wait to return to the world of Dex and Mosscap for another quiet adventure because this book was simply sublime, and I give it my most highest recommendation. *An e-copy was kindly provided to me by the publisher via NetGalley for honest review* Publishing 13th July 2021, MacMillan-Tor/Forge For more reviews and book related chat check out my blogFollow me on TwitterFriend me on Goodreads.", "I'm truly in awe of Becky Chambers.
